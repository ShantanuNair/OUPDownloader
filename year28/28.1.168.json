{"keywords": ["color", "genome sequencing"], "abstract": "The tmRNA Website collects all available tmRNA sequences into a single public resource, along with alignments and a guide to searching for new sequences. Over the last year, several sequences have been updated or newly found by monitoring ongoing genome sequencing projects; tmRNA sequence data from 70 species are now available. New features include: color-coding of sequences to mark suggested base-paired regions, a list of the literature concerning tmRNA, careful crediting of tmRNA sequence identifications, and a split browser window. Updates are very frequent. The tmRNA Website has a new URL: http:www.indiana.edu/~tmrna ", "authors": ["Kelly P.
