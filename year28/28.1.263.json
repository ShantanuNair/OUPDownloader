{"keywords": ["dna", "genome", "libraries", "sequence alignment", "software"], "abstract": "Pfam is a large collection of protein multiple sequence alignments and profile hidden Markov models. Pfam is available on the WWW in the UK at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/ , in Sweden at http://www.cgr.ki.se/Pfam/ and in the US at http://pfam.wustl.edu/ . The latest version (4.3) of Pfam contains 1815 families. These Pfam families match 63% of proteins in SWISS-PROT 37 and TrEMBL 9. For complete genomes Pfam currently matches up to half of the proteins. Genomic DNA can be directly searched against the Pfam library using the Wise2 package.", "authors": ["Alex Bateman", "Ewan Birney", "Richard Durbin", "Sean R. Eddy", "Kevin L. Howe", "Erik L. L.
