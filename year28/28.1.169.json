A tmRDB mirror site is located on the campus of Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, reachable at the URL http://www.ag.auburn.edu/mirror/tmRDB/ . Since April 1997, the tmRDB has provided sequences of tmRNA (previously called 10Sa RNA), a molecule present in most bacteria and some organelles. This release adds 17 new sequences for a total of 60 tmRNAs. Sequences and corresponding tmRNA-encoded tag peptides are tabulated in alphabetical and phylo\u00adgenetic order. The updated tmRNA alignment improves the secondary structures of known tmRNAs on the level of individual basepairs. tmRDB also provides an introduction to tmRNA function in trans-translation (with links to relevant literature), a limited number of tmRNA secondary structure diagrams, and numerous three-dimensional models generated interactively with the program ERNA-3D.", "authors": ["Christian Zwieb", "Jacek Wower"], "about": ["gated blood-pool imaging", "organelles", "peptides", "protein structure, secondary", "bacteria", "rna", "alabama", "molecule", "transluminal attenuation gradient", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "tmRDB (tmRNA database)\r\n "}
