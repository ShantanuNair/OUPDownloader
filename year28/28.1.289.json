{"keywords": ["databases", "benchmarking", "cataloging", "community", "electrical current"], "abstract": "The Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP; http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu ) is a database that documents experimentally determined protein\u2013protein interactions. This database is intended to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive and integrated tool for browsing and efficiently extracting information about protein interactions and interaction networks in biological processes. Beyond cataloging details of protein\u2013protein interactions, the DIP is useful for understanding protein function and protein\u2013protein relationships, studying the properties of networks of interacting proteins, benchmarking predictions of protein\u2013protein interactions, and studying the evolution of protein\u2013protein interactions.", "authors": ["Ioannis Xenarios", "Danny W.
