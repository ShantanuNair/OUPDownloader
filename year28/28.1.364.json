This KMDB utilizes a database software called MutationView which was designed to compile various mutation data and to provide graphical presentation of data analysis. Currently, the KMDB accommodates mutation data of 38 different genes for 35 different diseases which are involved in eye, heart, ear and brain. These KMDBs are accessible through http://mutview.dmb. med.keio.ac.jp with advanced internet browsers.", "authors": ["Shinsei Minoshima", "Susumu Mitsuyama", "Saho Ohno", "Takashi Kawamura", "Nobuyoshi Shimizu"], "about": ["mutation", "ear", "genes", "internet", "software", "brain", "eye", "heart", "3,3-dimethylbutan-1-ol", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Keio Mutation Database (KMDB) for human disease gene mutations\r\n "}
