This online resource, available at http://www.oup.co.uk/nar/Volume_28/Issue_01/html/gkd115_gml.html, is intended to serve as a searchable, up-to-date, centralized jumping-off point to individual Web sites. An emphasis has also been placed on including databases where new value is added to the underlying data by virtue of curation, new data connections, or other innovative approaches.", "authors": ["Andreas D.
