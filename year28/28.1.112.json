MTB is designed to serve as an information resource for cancer genetics researchers who use the laboratory mouse as a model system for understanding human disease processes. Data in MTB are obtained from the primary scientific literature and direct submissions by the research community. MTB is accessible from the Mouse Genome Informatics Web site (http://www.informatics.jax.org ). User support is available for MTB via Email at mgi-help@informatics.jax.org", "authors": ["Carol J.
