Features in the database include: intron nucleotide sequence, amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein, position of the introns at the amino acid level and intron phase. From ExInt, we have also generated four additional databases each with ExInt entries containing predicted introns, introns experimentally defined, organelle introns or nuclear introns. ExInt is accessible through a retrieval system with pointers to GenBank. The database can be searched by keywords, locus name, NID, accession number or length of the protein. ExInt is freely accessible at http://intron.bic.nus.edu.sg/exint/ exint.html ", "authors": ["M. Sakharkar", "M. Long", "T. W. Tan", "S.
