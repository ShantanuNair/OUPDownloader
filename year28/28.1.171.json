{"keywords": ["glycoprotein hormones, alpha subunit", "protein structure, secondary", "signal recognition particle", "rna", "protein secretion", "crystal structure"], "abstract": "The signal recognition particle database (SRPDB) is maintained at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler, Texas, and organizes SRP-related information about SRP RNA, SRP proteins and the SRP receptor. SRPDB is accessible on the WWW at the URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html . A mirror site of the SRPDB is located in Europe at the University of G\u00f6teborg, Sweden (http://www.medkem.gu.se/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html ). This release of SRPDB adds 10 new SRP RNA sequences (a total of 117 SRP RNAs), four protein SRP19 sequences (a total of 15), seven new SRP54 (ffh) sequences (a total of 52), and eight sequences of the SRP receptor alpha subunit (FtsY) (total of 36). Sequences are arranged in alphabetical and phylogenetic order and alignments are provided which highlight base paired and conserved regions. SPRDB also provides motifs to find new sequences, a brief introduction to SRP function in protein secretion, numerous SRP RNA secondary structure diagrams, 3-D SRP RNA models, and recently obtained crystal structure PDB coordinates of the human SRP54m domain.", "authors": ["Christian Zwieb", "Tore Samuelsson"], "about": ["glycoprotein hormones, alpha subunit", "protein structure, secondary", "signal recognition particle", "rna", "protein secretion", "crystal structure", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "SRPDB (Signal Recognition Particle Database)\r\n "}
