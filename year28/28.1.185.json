Currently, the database is derived from GenBank release 112, and it contains 51\u00a0289 protein-coding genes (287 209 exons) that harbor introns, along with extensive descriptions of each gene and its DNA and protein sequences, as well as splice motif information. There is 17% redundancy inherited from GenBank\u2014a purge at the 99% identity level reduced the database to 42\u00a0460 genes (243\u00a0589 exons). We have created subdatabases of genes whose intron positions have been experimentally determined. One such database, constructed by comparing genomic and mRNA sequences, contains 11\u00a0242 genes (62\u00a0474 exons). A larger database of 22\u00a0196 genes (105\u00a0595 exons) was constructed by selecting on keywords to eliminate computer-predicted genes. By examining the two nucleotides adjacent to the intron boundary, we infer that there is a 2% rate of errors or other deviations from the standard GT\u2026AG motif in nuclear genes. This criterion can be used to eliminate 4921 genes from the overall database. Various tools are provided to enable generation of user-specific subsets of the EID.
