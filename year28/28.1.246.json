It provides access to all structure entries deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Nucleic Acid Database (NDB). By combining automatic and manual processing it is possible to keep pace with the rapidly growing number of known biopolymer structures and to provide, for selected entries, information not available from automatic procedures. Each entry page contains basic information on the structure, various visualization and analysis tools as well as links to other databases. The visualization techniques adopted include static mono/stereo raster or vector graphics representations, virtual reality modeling (VRML), RasMol/Chime scripts and Java applets. A helix and bending analysis tool provides consistent information on about 750 DNA and RNA duplex structures. Access to metal-containing PDB entries is possible via the Periodic Table of Elements. Finally, general information on amino acids, cis-peptide bonds, structural elements in proteins, base pairs, nucleic acid model conformations and experimental methods for biopolymer structure determination is provided.", "authors": ["Jan Reichert", "Andreas Jabs", "Peter Slickers", "J\u00fcrgen S\u00fchnel"], "about": ["amino acids", "base pairing", "biopolymers", "nucleic acid databases", "helix (snails)", "infectious mononucleosis", "libraries", "metals", "nucleic acids", "peptides", "rna", "macromolecule", "periodic table of the elements", "virtual reality", "protein data bank", "script", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The IMB Jena Image Library of Biological Macromolecules\r\n "}
