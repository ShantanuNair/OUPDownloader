{"keywords": ["binding sites", "transcription factor"], "abstract": "ooTFD (object-oriented Transcription Factors Database) is an object-oriented successor to TFD. This database is aimed at capturing information regarding the polypeptide interactions which comprise and define the properties of transcription factors. ooTFD contains information about transcription factor binding sites, as well as composite relationships within transcription factors, which frequently occur as multisubunit proteins that form a complex interface to cellular processes outside the transcription machinery through protein\u2013protein interactions. In the past year, a few additions and changes were made to this database and associated tools, which are accessible through the IFTI-MIRAGE web site at http://www.ifti.org/ ", "authors": ["David Ghosh"], "about": ["binding sites", "transcription factor", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Object-oriented Transcription Factors Database (ooTFD)\r\n "}
