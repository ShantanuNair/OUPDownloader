{"keywords": ["genes", "libraries", "organizations"], "abstract": "KEYnet is a database where gene and protein names are hierarchically structured. Particular care has been devoted to the search and organisation of synonyms. The structuring is based on biological criteria in order to assist the user in data search and to minimise the risk of information loss. Links to the EMBL data library by the entry name and the accession number are implemented. KEYnet is available through the WWW at the following site: http://www.ba.cnr.it/keynet.html", "authors": ["D. Catalano", "F. Licciulli", "D. D\u2019Elia", "M.
