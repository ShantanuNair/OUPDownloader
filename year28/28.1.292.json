The sum of the codons used by 8792 organisms has also been calculated. The data files can be obtained from the anonymous ftp sites of DDBJ, Kazusa and EBI. A list of the codon usage of genes and the sum of the codons used by each organism can be obtained through the web site http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/ . The present study also reports recent developments on the WWW site. The new web interface provides data in the CodonFrequency-compatible format as well as in the traditional table format. The use of the database is facilitated by keyword based search analysis and the availability of codon usage tables for selected genes from each species. These new tools will provide users with the ability to further analyze for variations in codon usage among different genomes.", "authors": ["Yasukazu Nakamura", "Takashi Gojobori", "Toshimichi Ikemura"], "about": ["codon nucleotides", "clinical decision support systems", "dna", "genes", "genome", "open reading frames", "genbank", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Codon usage tabulated from international DNA sequence databases: status for the year 2000\r\n "}
