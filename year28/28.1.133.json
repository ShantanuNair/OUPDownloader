We have collected 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 tag sequences of mRNAs and their expression data from whole-mount in situ hybridi\u00adzation in early embryos. To date, we have determined more than 2000 tag-sequences of H.roretzi cDNAs and input them into public databases. The tag sequences and the expression data as well as additional information can be obtained through MAGEST via the WWW at http://www.genome.ad.jp/magest/", "authors": ["Takeshi Kawashima", "Shuichi Kawashima", "Minoru Kanehisa", "Hiroki Nishida", "Kazuhiro W.
