Composite regulatory elements contain two closely situated binding sites for distinct transcription factors and represent minimal functional units providing combinatorial transcriptional regulation. Both specific factor\u2013DNA and factor\u2013factor interactions contribute to the function of composite elements (CEs). Information about the structure of known CEs and specific gene regulation achieved through such CEs appears to be extremely useful for promoter prediction, for gene function prediction and for applied gene engineering as well. The structure of the relational model of COMPEL is determined by the concept of molecular structure and regulatory role of CEs. Based on the set of a particular CE, a program has been developed for searching potential CEs in gene regulatory regions. WWW search and browse routines were developed for COMPEL release 3.0. The COMPEL database equipped with the search and browse tools is available at http://compel.bionet.nsc.ru/ . The program for prediction of potential CEs of NFAT type is available at http://compel.bionet.nsc.ru/FunSite.html and http://transfac.gbf.de/dbsearch/funsitep/s_comp.html ", "authors": ["Olga V.
