It is thus quite likely, in searching sequence databases, that one will encounter a homolog with known structure and be able to use this information to infer structure\u2013function properties. The goal of Entrez\u2019s 3D structure database is to make this information accessible and useful to molecular biologists. To this end, Entrez\u2019s search engine provides three powerful features: (i)\u00a0Links between databases; one may search by term matching in Medline\u00ae, for example, and link to 3D structures reported in these articles. (ii) Sequence and structure neighbors; one may select all sequences similar to one of interest, for example, and link to any known 3D structures. (iii)\u00a0Sequence and structure visualization; identifying a homolog with known structure, one may view a combined molecular-graphic and alignment display, to infer approximate 3D structure.
