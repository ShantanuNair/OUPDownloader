Since this date we have published five databases from our central UK CropNet WWW site (http://synteny.nott.ac.uk/ ) with a further three to follow shortly. Our resource facilitates the identification and manipulation of agronomically important genes by laying a foundation for comparative analysis among crop plants and model species. In addition, we have developed a number of software tools that facilitate the visualisation and analysis of our data. Many of our tools are made freely available for use with both crop plant data and with data from other species.", "authors": ["Jo Dicks", "Mary Anderson", "Linda Cardle", "Sam Cartinhour", "Matthew Couchman", "Guy Davenport", "Jeremy Dickson", "Mike Gale", "David Marshall", "Sean May", "Hamish McWilliam", "Andrew O\u2019Malia", "Helen Ougham", "Martin Trick", "Sean Walsh", "Robbie Waugh"], "about": ["genes", "genome", "genomics", "plants", "software", "synteny", "bioinformatics", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "UK CropNet: a collection of databases and bioinformatics resources for crop plant genomics\r\n "}
