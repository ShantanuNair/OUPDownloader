This community database provides information about genes, serves as a mapping resource of the mouse genome, details mammalian orthologs, integrates experimental data, represents standardized mouse nomenclature for genes and alleles, incorporates links to other genomic resources such as sequence data, and includes a variety of additional information about the laboratory mouse. MGD scientists and annotators work cooperatively with the research community to provide an integrated, consensus view of the mouse genome while also providing experimental data including data conflicting with the consensus representation. Recent improvements focus on the representation of phenotypic information and the enhancement of gene and allele descriptions.", "authors": ["Judith A. Blake", "Janan T. Eppig", "Joel E.
