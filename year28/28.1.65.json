The current version describes regulatory signals of transcription initiation, promoters, regulatory binding sites of specific regulators, ribosome binding sites and terminators, as well as information on genes clustered in operons. These specific annotations have been gathered from a constant search in the literature, as well as based on computational sequence predictions. The genomic coordinates of all these objects in the E.coli K-12 chromosome are clearly indicated. Every known object has a link to at least one MEDLINE reference. We have also added direct links to recent expression data of E.coli K-12. The version presented here has important modifications both in the structure of the database, as well as in the amount and type of information encoded in the database.
