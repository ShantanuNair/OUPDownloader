In addition to facilitating the association of functional data among known genes from multiple organisms, XREFdb has developed strategies that provide access to information associated with as-yet unstudied genes. The database organizes protein similarity and genetic map positional information from diverse sources in the public domain to facilitate investigator evaluation of potential functional signifi\u00adcance.
