Submissions to dbSNP will be integrated with other sources of information at NCBI such as GenBank, PubMed, LocusLink and the Human Genome Project data. The complete contents of dbSNP are available to the public at website: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP . Submitted SNPs can also be downloaded via anonymous FTP at ftp://ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/snp/ ", "authors": ["Elizabeth M. Smigielski", "Karl Sirotkin", "Minghong Ward", "Stephen T.
