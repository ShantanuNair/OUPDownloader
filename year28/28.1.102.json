{"keywords": ["amino acid motifs", "arabidopsis", "protein databases", "genome", "genbank", "basic local alignment search tool"], "abstract": "The Database of Arabidopsis thaliana Annotation (DAtA) was created to enable easy access to and analysis of all the Arabidopsis genome project annotation. The database was constructed using the completed A.thaliana genomic sequence data currently in GenBank. An automated annotation process was used to predict coding sequences for GenBank records that do not include annotation. DAtA also contains protein motifs and protein similarities derived from searches of the proteins in DAtA with motif databases and the non-redundant protein database. The database is routinely updated to include new GenBank submissions for Arabidopsis genomic sequences and new Blast and protein motif search results. A web interface to DAtA allows coding sequences to be searched by name, comment, blast similarity or motif field. In addition, browse options present lists of either all the protein names or identified motifs present in the sequenced A.thaliana genome. The database can be accessed at http://baggage.stanford.edu/group/arabprotein/", "authors": ["Curtis J. Palm", "Nancy A. Federspiel", "Ronald W.
