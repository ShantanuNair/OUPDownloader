It incorporates the available BAC mapping data from different genome centers and the annotation results of each end sequence for the contents of repeats, ESTs and STS markers. For each BAC end the database integrates the sequence, the phred quality scores, the map and the annotation, and provides links to sites of the library information, the reports of GenBank, dbGSS and GDB, and other relevant data. The database is freely accessible via the web and supports sequence or clone searches and anonymous FTP. The relevant sites and resources are described at http://www. tigr.org/tdb/humgen/bac_end_search/bac_end_intro.html ", "authors": ["Shaying Zhao"], "about": ["clone cells", "expressed sequence tags", "genome", "libraries", "genbank", "balance error scoring system (bess)", "myoc gene", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Human BAC Ends\r\n "}
