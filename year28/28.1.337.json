It has been established experimentally that a subset of genes containing this motif plays key roles in the orchestration of gene expression during development. Auto- and cross-regulatory functional interactions join homeobox genes into genetic networks. We have developed a specialized database HOX-Pro in order to arrange all available data on structure, function, phylogeny and evolution of Hox genes, Hox clusters and Hox networks. Its primary location is http://www.iephb.nw.ru/hoxpro . The database is also mirrored at http://www.mssm.edu/molbio/hoxpro . The HOX-Pro database is aimed at: (i)\u00a0analysis and classification of regulatory and coding regions in diverse homeobox and related genes; (ii)\u00a0comparative analysis of organization of \u2018Hox-based\u2019 genetic networks in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the mouse Mus musculus; and (iii) analysis of phylo\u00adgeny and evolution of homeobox genes and clusters.", "authors": ["Alexander V.
