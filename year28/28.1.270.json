{"keywords": ["amino acid sequence", "tertiary protein structure", "taxonomic classification", "basic local alignment search tool"], "abstract": "The SYSTERS (short for SYSTEmatic Re-Searching) protein sequence cluster set consists of the classification of all sequences from SWISS-PROT and PIR into disjoint protein family clusters and hierarchically into superfamily and subfamily clusters. The cluster set can be searched with a sequence using the SSMAL search tool or a traditional database search tool like BLAST or FASTA. Additionally a multiple alignment is generated for each cluster and annotated with domain information from the Pfam database of protein domain families. A taxonomic overview of the organisms covered by a cluster is given based on the NCBI taxonomy. The cluster set is available for querying and browsing at http://www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/tbi/services/cluster/systersform ", "authors": ["A. Krause", "J. Stoye", "M.
