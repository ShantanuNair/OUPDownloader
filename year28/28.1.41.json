{"keywords": ["amino acid sequence", "biochemistry", "information centers", "internet", "information resources", "search engine"], "abstract": "The Protein Information Resource (PIR) produces the largest, most comprehensive, annotated protein sequence database in the public domain, the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database, in collaboration with the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) and the Japan International Protein Sequence Database (JIPID). The expanded PIR WWW site allows sequence similarity and text searching of the Protein Sequence Database and auxiliary databases. Several new web-based search engines combine searches of sequence similarity and database annotation to facilitate the analysis and functional identification of proteins. New capabilities for searching the PIR sequence databases include annotation-sorted search, domain search, combined global and domain search, and interactive text searches. The PIR-International databases and search tools are accessible on the PIR WWW site at http://pir.georgetown.edu and at the MIPS WWW site at http://www.mips.biochem.mpg.de . The PIR-International Protein Sequence Database and other files are also available by FTP.", "authors": ["Winona C. Barker", "John S. Garavelli", "Hongzhan Huang", "Peter B. McGarvey", "Bruce C.
