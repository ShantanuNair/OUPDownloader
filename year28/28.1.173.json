Release 7.1 (September 17, 1999) included more than 10 700 small subunit rRNA sequences. More than 850 type strain sequences were identified and added to the prokaryotic alignment, bringing the total number of type sequences to 3324 representing 2460 different species. Availability of an RDP-II mirror site in Japan is also near completion. RDP-II provides aligned and annotated rRNA sequences, derived phylogenetic trees and taxonomic hierarchies, and analysis services through its WWW server (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/ ). Analysis services include rRNA probe checking, approx\u00adi\u00admate phylogenetic placement of user sequences, screening user sequences for possible chimeric rRNA sequences, automated alignment, production of similarity matrices and services to plan and analyze terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) experiments.", "authors": ["Bonnie L.
