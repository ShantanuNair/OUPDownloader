The data accessible in ZmDB are mostly generated in a large collaborative project of maize gene discovery, sequencing and phenotypic analysis using a transposon tagging strategy and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing. ESTs constitute most of the current content. Database search tools, convenient links to external databases, and novel sequence analysis programs for spliced alignment are provided and together serve as an efficient protocol for gene discovery by sequence inspection. ZmDB can be accessed at http://zmdb. iastate.edu . ZmDB also provides web-based ordering of materials generated in the project, including EST and genomic DNA clones, seeds of mutant plants and microarrays of amplified EST and genomic DNA sequences.", "authors": ["Xiaowu Gai", "Shailesh Lal", "Liqun Xing", "Volker Brendel", "Virginia Walbot"], "about": ["phenotype", "databases", "clone cells", "dna", "expressed sequence tags", "genes", "genome", "internet", "plants", "seeds", "sequence analysis", "maize", "inspection", "dna transposons", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Gene discovery using the maize genome database ZmDB\r\n "}
