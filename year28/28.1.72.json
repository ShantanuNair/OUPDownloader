The database contains annotations for each protein-coding gene deduced from the entire nucleotide sequence of the genome, gene classification lists, and keyword and similarity search engines. Core portions of CyanoBase consist of annotations for each of the 3168 protein genes deduced from the entire nucleotide sequence of this genome. The contents of each gene were improved by updating with the results of similarity searches and by introducing references for analysis in bioinformatics. The database now contains repository facilities that store and provide experimental information, in addition to providing proposals for the function of each gene. This information should help to avoid unnecessary, overlapping experiments and should assist communication between scientists who wish to elucidate the function of putative genes on the cyanobacteria genome.
