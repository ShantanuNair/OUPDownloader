{"abstract": "In the past year, DDBJ (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) collected and released 1 956 826 entries or 1 741 313 111 bases. The released data include \u223c90 000 ESTs and cDNAs of Macaca fascicularis, and 280 million bases of mouse GSS. In addition to the data collection, we have indexed the submitted data to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, http://www.insdc.org) to classify the entries into research projects behind data submissions. They are expected to be useful to the data submitters and users for enhancing the data submission, retrieval and systematic data analyses at INSDC. The results of indexing also allow one to grasp research projects in life sciences that promoted and produced the DNA sequences submitted to INSDC.", "authors": ["Kousaku Okubo", "Hideaki Sugawara", "Takashi Gojobori", "Yoshio Tateno"], "about": ["Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "DDBJ in preparation for overview of research activities behind data submissions\r\n "}
