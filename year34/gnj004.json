{"abstract": " Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a widely used method to explore in vivo interactions between proteins and DNA. The ChIP assay takes several days to complete, involves several tube transfers and uses either phenol\u2013chlorophorm or spin columns to purify DNA. The traditional ChIP method becomes a challenge when handling multiple samples. We have developed an efficient and rapid Chelex resin-based ChIP procedure that dramatically reduces time of the assay and uses only a single tube to isolate PCR-ready DNA. This method greatly facilitates the probing of chromatin changes over many time points with several antibodies in one experiment. ", "authors": ["Joel D.
