{"abstract": "The G\u00e9nolevures online database (http://cbi.labri.fr/Genolevures/) provides tools and data relative to 4 complete and 10 partial genome sequences determined and manually annotated by the G\u00e9nolevures Consortium, to facilitate comparative genomic studies of hemiascomycetous yeasts. With their relatively small and compact genomes, yeasts offer a unique opportunity for exploring eukaryotic genome evolution. The new version of the G\u00e9nolevures database provides truly complete (subtelomere to subtelomere) chromosome sequences, 25\u2009000 protein-coding and tRNA genes, and in silico analyses for each gene element. A new feature of the database is a novel collection of conserved multi-species protein families and their mapping to metabolic pathways, coupled with an advanced search feature. Data are presented with a focus on relations between genes and genomes: conservation of genes and gene families, speciation, chromosomal reorganization and synteny. The G\u00e9nolevures site includes an area for specific studies by members of its international community.", "authors": ["David Sherman", "Pascal Durrens", "Florian Iragne", "Emmanuelle Beyne", "Macha Nikolski", "Jean-Luc Souciet"], "about": ["Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "G\u00e9nolevures complete genomes provide data and tools for comparative genomics of hemiascomycetous yeasts\r\n "}
