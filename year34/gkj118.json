{"abstract": "TreeFam is a database of phylogenetic trees of gene families found in animals. It aims to develop a curated resource that presents the accurate evolutionary history of all animal gene families, as well as reliable ortholog and paralog assignments. Curated families are being added progressively, based on seed alignments and trees in a similar fashion to Pfam. Release 1.1 of TreeFam contains curated trees for 690 families and automatically generated trees for another 11\u2009646 families. These represent over 128\u2009000 genes from nine fully sequenced animal genomes and over 45\u2009000 other animal proteins from UniProt; \u223c40\u201385% of proteins encoded in the fully sequenced animal genomes are included in TreeFam. TreeFam is freely available at http://www.treefam.org and http://treefam.genomics.org.cn.", "authors": ["Heng Li", "Avril Coghlan", "Jue Ruan", "Lachlan James Coin", "Jean-Karim H\u00e9rich\u00e9", "Lara Osmotherly", "Ruiqiang Li", "Tao Liu", "Zhang Zhang", "Lars Bolund", "Gane Ka-Shu Wong", "Weimou Zheng", "Paramvir Dehal", "Jun Wang", "Richard Durbin"], "about": ["Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "TreeFam: a curated database of phylogenetic trees of animal gene families\r\n "}
