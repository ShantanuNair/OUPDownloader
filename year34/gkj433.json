{"abstract": " Translation initiation represents a key step during regulation of gene expression in chloroplasts. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of three suppressor point mutations which overcome a translational defect caused by the deletion of a U-rich element in the 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) of the psbD mRNA in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . All three suppressors affect a secondary RNA structure encompassing the psbD AUG initiation codon within a double-stranded region as judged by the analysis of site-directed chloroplast mutants as well as in vitro RNA mapping experiments using RNase H. In conclusion, the data suggest that these new element serves as a negative regulator which mediates a rapid shut-down of D2 synthesis.
