{"abstract": "The LIPID MAPS Proteome Database (LMPD) is an object-relational database of lipid-associated protein sequences and annotations. The initial release contains 2959 records, representing human and mouse proteins involved in lipid metabolism. UniProt IDs were obtained based on keyword search of KEGG and GO databases, and this LMPD protein list was then enhanced with annotations from UniProt, EntrezGene, ENZYME, GO, KEGG and other public resources. We also assigned associations with general lipid categories, based on GO and KEGG annotations. Users may search LMPD by database ID or keyword, and filter by species and/or lipid class associations; from the search results, one can then access a compilation of data relevant to each protein of interest, cross-linked to external databases. The LIPID MAPS Proteome Database (LMPD) is publicly available from the LIPID MAPS Consortium website (http://www.lipidmaps.org/).
