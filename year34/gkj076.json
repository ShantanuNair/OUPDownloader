{"abstract": "As the University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (UM-BBD, http://umbbd.ahc.umn.edu/) starts its second decade, it includes information on over 900 compounds, over 600 enzymes, nearly 1000 reactions and about 350 microorganism entries. Its Biochemical Periodic Tables have grown to include biological information for almost all stable, non-noble-gas elements (http://umbbd.ahc.umn.edu/periodic/). Its Pathway Prediction System (PPS) (http://umbbd.ahc.umn.edu/predict/) is now an internationally recognized, open system for predicting microbial catabolism of organic compounds. Graphical display of PPS rules, a stand-alone version of the PPS and guidance for PPS users are being developed. The next decade should see the PPS, and the UM-BBD on which it is based, find increasing use by national and international government agencies, commercial organizations and educational institutions.", "authors": ["Lynda B.
