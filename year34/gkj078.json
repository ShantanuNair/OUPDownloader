{"abstract": "The database, CryptoDB (http://CryptoDB.org), is a community bioinformatics resource for the AIDS-related apicomplexan-parasite, Cryptosporidium. CryptoDB integrates whole genome sequence and annotation with expressed sequence tag and genome survey sequence data and provides supplemental bioinformatics analyses and data-mining tools. A simple, yet comprehensive web interface is available for mining and visualizing the data. CryptoDB is allied with the databases PlasmoDB and ToxoDB via ApiDB, an NIH/NIAID-fundedBioinformatics Resource Center. Recent updates to CryptoDB include the deposition of annotated genome sequences for Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis, migration to a relational database (GUS), a new query and visualization interface and the introduction of Web services.", "authors": ["Mark Heiges", "Haiming Wang", "Edward Robinson", "Cristina Aurrecoechea", "Xin Gao", "Nivedita Kaluskar", "Philippa Rhodes", "Sammy Wang", "Cong-Zhou He", "Yanqi Su", "John Miller", "Eileen Kraemer", "Jessica C.
