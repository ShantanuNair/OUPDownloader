{"abstract": "MfunGD (http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/mfungd/) provides a resource for annotated mouse proteins and their occurrence in protein networks. Manual annotation concentrates on proteins which are found to interact physically with other proteins. Accordingly, manually curated information from a protein\u2013protein interaction database (MPPI) and a database of mammalian protein complexes is interconnected with MfunGD. Protein function annotation is performed using the Functional Catalogue (FunCat) annotation scheme which is widely used for the analysis of protein networks. The dataset is also supplemented with information about the literature that was used in the annotation process as well as links to the SIMAP Fasta database, the Pedant protein analysis system and cross-references to external resources. Proteins that so far were not manually inspected are annotated automatically by a graphical probabilistic model and/or superparamagnetic clustering. The database is continuously expanding to include the rapidly growing amount of functional information about gene products from mouse. MfunGD is implemented in GenRE, a J2EE-based component-oriented multi-tier architecture following the separation of concern principle.", "authors": ["Andreas Ruepp", "Octave Noubibou Doudieu", "Jos van den Oever", "Barbara Brauner", "Irmtraud Dunger-Kaltenbach", "Gisela Fobo", "Goar Frishman", "Corinna Montrone", "Christine Skornia", "Steffi Wanka", "Thomas Rattei", "Philipp Pagel", "Louise Riley", "Dmitrij Frishman", "Dimitrij Surmeli", "Igor V.
