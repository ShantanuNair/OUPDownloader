{"abstract": "The Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN; http://zfin.org) is a web based community resource that implements the curation of zebrafish genetic, genomic and developmental data. ZFIN provides an integrated representation of mutants, genes, genetic markers, mapping panels, publications and community resources such as meeting announcements and contact information. Recent enhancements to ZFIN include (i) comprehensive curation of gene expression data from the literature and from directly submitted data, (ii) increased support and annotation of the genome sequence, (iii) expanded use of ontologies to support curation and query forms, (iv) curation of morpholino data from the literature, and (v) increased versatility of gene pages, with new data types, links and analysis tools.", "authors": ["Judy Sprague", "Leyla Bayraktaroglu", "Dave Clements", "Tom Conlin", "David Fashena", "Ken Frazer", "Melissa Haendel", "Douglas G.
