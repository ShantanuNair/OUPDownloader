{"abstract": "The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (www.ebi.ac.uk/embl) at the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, UK, offers a comprehensive set of publicly available nucleotide sequence and annotation, freely accessible to all. Maintained in collaboration with partners DDBJ and GenBank, coverage includes whole genome sequencing project data, directly submitted sequence, sequence recorded in support of patent applications and much more. The database continues to offer submission tools, data retrieval facilities and user support. In 2005, the volume of data offered has continued to grow exponentially. In addition to the newly presented data, the database encompasses a range of new data types generated by novel technologies, offers enhanced presentation and searchability of the data and has greater integration with other data resources offered at the EBI and elsewhere. In stride with these developing data types, the database has continued to develop submission and retrieval tools to maximise the information content of submitted data and to offer the simplest possible submission routes for data producers. New developments, the submission process, data retrieval and access to support are presented in this paper, along with links to sources of further information.", "authors": ["Guy Cochrane", "Philippe Aldebert", "Nicola Althorpe", "Mikael Andersson", "Wendy Baker", "Alastair Baldwin", "Kirsty Bates", "Sumit Bhattacharyya", "Paul Browne", "Alexandra van den Broek", "Matias Castro", "Karyn Duggan", "Ruth Eberhardt", "Nadeem Faruque", "John Gamble", "Carola Kanz", "Tamara Kulikova", "Charles Lee", "Rasko Leinonen", "Quan Lin", "Vincent Lombard", "Rodrigo Lopez", "Michelle McHale", "Hamish McWilliam", "Gaurab Mukherjee", "Francesco Nardone", "Maria Pilar Garcia Pastor", "Siamak Sobhany", "Peter Stoehr", "Katerina Tzouvara", "Robert Vaughan", "Dan Wu", "Weimin Zhu", "Rolf Apweiler"], "about": ["Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database: developments in 2005\r\n "}
