{"abstract": "The Genomes On Line Database (GOLD) is a web resource for comprehensive access to information regarding complete and ongoing genome sequencing projects worldwide. The database currently incorporates information on over 1500 sequencing projects, of which 294 have been completed and the data deposited in the public databases. GOLD v.2 has been expanded to provide information related to organism properties such as phenotype, ecotype and disease. Furthermore, project relevance and availability information is now included. GOLD is available at http://www.genomesonline.org. It is also mirrored at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Crete, Greece at http://gold.imbb.forth.gr/", "authors": ["Konstantinos Liolios", "Nektarios Tavernarakis", "Philip Hugenholtz", "Nikos C.
