{"abstract": "Recently, a multiple gene cassette with mutagenic translation synthesis activity was identified and shown to be under LexA regulation in several proteobacteria species. In this work, we have traced down instances of this multiple gene cassette across the bacteria domain. Phylogenetic analyses show that this cassette has undergone several reorganizations since its inception in the actinobacteria, and that it has dispersed across the bacterial domain through a combination of vertical inheritance, lateral gene transfer and duplication. In addition, our analyses show that LexA regulation of this multiple gene cassette is persistent in all the phyla in which it has been detected, and suggest that this regulation is prompted by the combined activity of two of its constituent genes: a polymerase V homolog and an alpha subunit of the DNA polymerase III.", "authors": ["Ivan Erill", "Susana Campoy", "Gerard Mazon", "Jordi Barb\u00e9"], "about": ["Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Dispersal and regulation of an adaptive mutagenesis cassette in the bacteria domain\r\n "}
