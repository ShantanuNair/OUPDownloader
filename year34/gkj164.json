{"abstract": "ASAP is a comprehensive web-based system for community genome annotation and analysis. ASAP is being used for a large-scale effort to augment and curate annotations for genomes of enterobacterial pathogens and for additional genome sequences. New tools, such as the genome alignment program Mauve, have been incorporated into ASAP in order to improve display and analysis of related genomes. Recent improvements to the database and challenges for future development of the system are discussed. ASAP is available on the web at https://asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/asap/logon.php.", "authors": ["Jeremy D. Glasner", "Michael Rusch", "Paul Liss", "Guy Plunkett, III", "Eric L.
