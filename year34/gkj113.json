{"abstract": "TiProD is a database of human promoter sequences for which some functional features are known. It allows a user to query individual promoters and the expression pattern they mediate, gene expression signatures of individual tissues, and to retrieve sets of promoters according to their tissue-specific activity or according to individual Gene Ontology terms the corresponding genes are assigned to. We have defined a measure for tissue-specificity that allows the user to discriminate between ubiquitously and specifically expressed genes. The database is accessible at http://tiprod.cbi.pku.edu.cn:8080/index.html.", "authors": ["Xin Chen", "Jian-min Wu", "Klaus Hornischer", "Alexander Kel", "Edgar Wingender"], "about": ["Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "TiProD: the Tissue-specific Promoter Database\r\n "}
