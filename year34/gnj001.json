{"abstract": " The prokaryotic \u03b2 recombinase catalyzes site-specific recombination between two directly oriented minimal six sites in chromatin-integrated substrates. Here, we demonstrate that an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-fused version of \u03b2 recombinase (\u03b2-EGFP) is fully active, retaining most specific activity. It is used to develop a recombination-dependent activatable gene expression (RAGE) system based on the androgen receptor (AR) ligand-binding domain (LBD). Two hybrid molecules, a direct fusion of the LBD-AR to the C-terminus of \u03b2 recombinase (\u03b2-AR) and a triple fusion of \u03b2-EGFP to the same ligand-binding domain (\u03b2-EGFP-AR), were engineered and their subcellular behavior, stability and catalytic activity were evaluated. Both chimeric \u03b2 recombinase proteins showed in vivo inducible recombinogenic activity dependent on addition of an androgen receptor agonist, although the \u03b2-AR fusion protein demonstrated more accurate ligand-dependent translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus.
