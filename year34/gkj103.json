{"abstract": "ProTherm and ProNIT are two thermodynamic databases that contain experimentally determined thermodynamic parameters of protein stability and protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions, respectively. The current versions of both the databases have considerably increased the total number of entries and enhanced search interface with added new fields, improved search, display and sorting options. As on September 2005, ProTherm release 5.0 contains 17\u2009113 entries from 771 proteins, retrieved from 1497 scientific articles (\u223c20% increase in data from the previous version). ProNIT release 2.0 contains 4900 entries from 273 research articles, representing 158 proteins. Both databases can be queried using WWW interfaces. Both quick search and advanced search are provided on this web page to facilitate easy retrieval and display of the data from these databases. ProTherm is freely available online at http://gibk26.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/jouhou/Protherm/protherm.html and ProNIT at http://gibk26.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/jouhou/pronit/pronit.html.", "authors": ["M. D.
