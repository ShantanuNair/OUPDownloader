{"abstract": "CyBase is a curated database and information source for backbone-cyclized proteins. The database incorporates naturally occurring cyclic proteins as well as synthetic derivatives, grafted analogues and acyclic permutants. The database provides a centralized repository of information on all aspects of cyclic protein biology and addresses issues pertaining to the management and searching of topologically circular sequences. The database is freely available at http://research.imb.uq.edu.au/cybase.", "authors": ["Jason P. Mulvenna", "Conan Wang", "David J.
