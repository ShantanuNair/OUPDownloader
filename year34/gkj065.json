{"abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides (ODNs) technology is one of the important approaches for the sequence-specific knockdown of gene expression. ODNs have been used as research tools in the post-genome era, as well as new types of therapeutic agents. Since finding effective target sites within RNA is a hard work for antisense ODNs design, various experimental methods and computational approaches have been proposed. For better sharing of the experimented and published ODNs, valid and invalid ODNs reported in literatures are screened, collected and stored in AOBase. Till now, \u223c700 ODNs against 46 target mRNAs are contained in AOBase. Entries can be explored via TargetSearch and AOSearch web retrieval interfaces. AOBase can not only be useful in ODNs selection for gene function exploration, but also contribute to mining rules and developing algorithms for rational ODNs design.
