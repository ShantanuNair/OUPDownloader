{"abstract": "Pathguide: the Pathway Resource List (http://pathguide.org) is a meta-database that provides an overview of more than 190 web-accessible biological pathway and network databases. These include databases on metabolic pathways, signaling pathways, transcription factor targets, gene regulatory networks, genetic interactions, protein\u2013compound interactions, and protein\u2013protein interactions. The listed databases are maintained by diverse groups in different locations and the information in them is derived either from the scientific literature or from systematic experiments. Pathguide is useful as a starting point for biological pathway analysis and for content aggregation in integrated biological information systems.", "authors": ["Gary D. Bader", "Michael P.
