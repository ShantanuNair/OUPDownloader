{"abstract": "We present here LOCATE, a curated, web-accessible database that houses data describing the membrane organization and subcellular localization of proteins from the FANTOM3 Isoform Protein Sequence set. Membrane organization is predicted by the high-throughput, computational pipeline MemO. The subcellular locations of selected proteins from this set were determined by a high-throughput, immunofluorescence-based assay and by manually reviewing >1700 peer-reviewed publications. LOCATE represents the first effort to catalogue the experimentally verified subcellular location and membrane organization of mammalian proteins using a high-throughput approach and provides localization data for \u223c40% of the mouse proteome. It is available at http://locate.imb.uq.edu.au.", "authors": ["J. Lynn Fink", "Rajith N. Aturaliya", "Melissa J. Davis", "Fasheng Zhang", "Kelly Hanson", "Melvena S.
