{"abstract": "Transcriptome microarrays have become one of the tools of choice for investigating the genes involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, as well as finding new biomarkers and gene expression signatures for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Here, we describe a new database for Integrated Tumor Transcriptome Array and Clinical data Analysis (ITTACA). ITTACA centralizes public datasets containing both gene expression and clinical data. ITTACA currently focuses on the types of cancer that are of particular interest to research teams at Institut Curie: breast carcinoma, bladder carcinoma and uveal melanoma. A web interface allows users to carry out different class comparison analyses, including the comparison of expression distribution profiles, tests for differential expression and patient survival analyses. ITTACA is complementary to other databases, such as GEO and SMD, because it offers a better integration of clinical data and different functionalities. It also offers more options for class comparison analyses when compared with similar projects such as Oncomine. For example, users can define their own patient groups according to clinical data or gene expression levels. This added flexibility and the user-friendly web interface makes ITTACA especially useful for comparing personal results with the results in the existing literature. ITTACA is accessible online at http://bioinfo.curie.fr/ittaca.", "authors": ["Adil Elfilali", "S\u00e9verine Lair", "Catia Verbeke", "Philippe La Rosa", "Fran\u00e7ois Radvanyi", "Emmanuel Barillot"], "about": ["Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "ITTACA: a new database for integrated tumor transcriptome array and clinical data analysis\r\n "}
