{"abstract": "BioModels Database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), part of the international initiative BioModels.net, provides access to published, peer-reviewed, quantitative models of biochemical and cellular systems. Each model is carefully curated to verify that it corresponds to the reference publication and gives the proper numerical results. Curators also annotate the components of the models with terms from controlled vocabularies and links to other relevant data resources. This allows the users to search accurately for the models they need. The models can currently be retrieved in the SBML format, and import/export facilities are being developed to extend the spectrum of formats supported by the resource.", "authors": ["Nicolas Le Nov\u00e8re", "Benjamin Bornstein", "Alexander Broicher", "M\u00e9lanie Courtot", "Marco Donizelli", "Harish Dharuri", "Lu Li", "Herbert Sauro", "Maria Schilstra", "Bruce Shapiro", "Jacky L.
