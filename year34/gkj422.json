{"abstract": " NF-IL6\u03b2 regulates gene expression and plays function roles in many tissues. The EGF-regulated cyclooxygenase-2 ( cox-2 ) expression is mediated through p38 MAPK signaling pathway and positively correlates with NF-IL6\u03b2 expression in A431 cells. NF-IL6\u03b2 coordinated with c-Jun on cox-2 transcriptional activation by reporter and small interfering RNA assays. NF-IL6\u03b2 could directly bind to CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and cyclic AMP-response element (CRE) sites of the cox-2 promoter by in vitro -DNA binding assay. The C/EBP site was important for basal and, to a lesser extent, for EGF-regulated cox-2 transcription, while the CRE site was a more specific response to EGF inducibility of cox-2 gene. SUMO1 expression attenuated EGF- and NF-IL6\u03b2-induced cox-2 promoter activities. NF-IL6\u03b2 was found to be sumoylated by in vivo - and in vitro -sumoylation assays, and the SUMO1-NF-IL6\u03b2 (suNF-IL6\u03b2) lost its ability to interact with p300 in in vitro -binding assay. NF-IL6\u03b2 was also acetylated by p300, and acetylation of NF-IL6\u03b2 enhanced the cox-2 promoter activity stimulated by NF-IL6\u03b2 itself. In vivo -DNA binding assay demonstrated that EGF stimulated the recruitment of p300 and NF-IL6\u03b2 to the cox-2 promoter, yet promoted the dissociation of SUMO1-modificated proteins from the promoter. These results indicated that NF-IL6\u03b2 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of basal and EGF-induced cox-2 transcription.
