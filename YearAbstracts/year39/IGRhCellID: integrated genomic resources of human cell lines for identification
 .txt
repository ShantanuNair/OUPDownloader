 Cell line identification is emerging as an essential method for every cell line user in research community to avoid using misidentified cell lines for experiments and publications. IGRhCellID ( http://igrcid.ibms.sinica.edu.tw ) is designed to integrate eight cell identification methods including seven methods (STR profile, gender, immunotypes, karyotype, isoenzyme profile, TP53 mutation and mutations of cancer genes) available in various public databases and our method of profiling genome alterations of human cell lines. With data validation of 11 small deleted genes in human cancer cell lines, profiles of genomic alterations further allow users to search for human cell lines with deleted gene to serve as indigenous knock-out cell model (such as SMAD4 in gene view), with amplified gene to be the cell models for testing therapeutic efficacy (such as ERBB2 in gene view) and with overlapped aberrant chromosomal loci for revealing common cancer genes (such as 9p21.3 homozygous deletion with co-deleted CDKN2A , CDKN2B and MTAP in chromosome view). IGRhCellID provides not only available methods for cell identification to help eradicating concerns of using misidentified cells but also designated genetic features of human cell lines for experiments.
