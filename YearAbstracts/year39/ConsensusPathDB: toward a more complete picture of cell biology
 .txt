 ConsensusPathDB is a meta-database that integrates different types of functional interactions from heterogeneous interaction data resources. Physical protein interactions, metabolic and signaling reactions and gene regulatory interactions are integrated in a seamless functional association network that simultaneously describes multiple functional aspects of genes, proteins, complexes, metabolites, etc. With 155 432 human, 194 480 yeast and 13 648 mouse complex functional interactions (originating from 18 databases on human and eight databases on yeast and mouse interactions each), ConsensusPathDB currently constitutes the most comprehensive publicly available interaction repository for these species. The Web interface at http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de offers different ways of utilizing these integrated interaction data, in particular with tools for visualization, analysis and interpretation of high-throughput expression data in the light of functional interactions and biological pathways.
