 By broad literature survey, we have developed a leaf senescence database (LSD, http://www.eplantsenescence.org/ ) that contains a total of 1145 senescence associated genes (SAGs) from 21 species. These SAGs were retrieved based on genetic, genomic, proteomic, physiological or other experimental evidence, and were classified into different categories according to their functions in leaf senescence or morphological phenotypes when mutated. We made extensive annotations for these SAGs by both manual and computational approaches, and users can either browse or search the database to obtain information including literatures, mutants, phenotypes, expression profiles, miRNA interactions, orthologs in other plants and cross links to other databases. We have also integrated a bioinformatics analysis platform WebLab into LSD, which allows users to perform extensive sequence analysis of their interested SAGs. The SAG sequences in LSD can also be downloaded readily for bulk analysis. We believe that the LSD contains the largest number of SAGs to date and represents the most comprehensive and informative plant senescence-related database, which would facilitate the systems biology research and comparative studies on plant aging.
