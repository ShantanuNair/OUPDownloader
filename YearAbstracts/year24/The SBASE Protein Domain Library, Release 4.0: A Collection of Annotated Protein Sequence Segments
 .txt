 SBASE 4.0 is the fourth release of SBASE, a collection of annotated protein domain sequences that represent various structural, functional, ligand binding and topogenic segments of proteins. SBASE was designed to facilitate the detection of functional homologies and can be searched with standard database search tools, such as FASTA and BLAST3. The present release contains 61 137 entries provided with standardized names and cross-referenced to all major protein, nucleic acid and sequence pattern collections. The entries are clustered into 13 155 groups in order to facilitate detection of distant similarities. SBASE 4.0 is freely available by anonymous ftp file transfer from ftp.icgeb.trieste.it . Individual records can be retrieved with the gopher server at http:icgeb.trieste.it and with a World Wide Web server at http://www.icgeb.trieste.it . Automated searching of SBASE with BLAST can be carried out with the electronic mail server sbase@ic-geb.trieste.it , which now also provides a graphic representation of the homologies. A related mail server, domain@hubi.abc.hu , assigns SBASE domain homologies on the basis of SWISS-PROT searches.
