The genome sequence database (GSDB) is a complete, publicly available relational database of DNA sequences and annotation maintained by the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) under a Cooperative Agreement with the US Department of Energy (DOE). GSDB provides direct, client-server access to the database for data contributions, community annotation and SQL queries. The GSDB Annotator, a multi-platform graphic user interface, is freely available. Automatically updated relational replicates of GSDB are also freely available.
