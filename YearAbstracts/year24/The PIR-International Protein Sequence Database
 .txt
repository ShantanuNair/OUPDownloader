From its origin the Protein Sequence Database has been designed to support research and has focused on comprehensive coverage, quality control and organization of the data in accordance with biological principles. Since 1988 the database has been maintained collaboratively within the framework of PIR-International, an association of macromolecular sequence data collection centers dedicated to fostering international cooperation as an essential element in the development of scientific databases. The database is widely distributed and is available on the World Wide Web, via ftp, email server, on CD-ROM and magnetic media. It is widely redistributed and incorporated into many other protein sequence data compilations, including SWISS-PROT and the Entrez system of the NCBI.
