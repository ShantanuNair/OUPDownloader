The SV40 T antigen database is a listing of plasmids and/or viruses that express mutant forms of the virus-encoded large T antigen protein. The parental virus strain, nucleic acid sequence of the mutations, the effect of the mutation on the T antigen amino acid sequence, and key references are included in the listing. The database is available from the authors as a Macintosh FileMaker Pro file, or as a hard copy printout.
