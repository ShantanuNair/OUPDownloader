 The 23S Ribosomal RNA Mutation Database (23SMDB), provides a list of mutated positions in 23S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli and the identity of each alteration. Information provided for each mutation includes: (i) a brief description of the phenotype(s) associated with each mutation, (ii) whether a mutant phenotype has been detected by in vivo or in vitro methods, and (iii) relevant literature citations. The database is available via ftp and on the World Wide Web.
