 In 1994 we described a list of âˆ¼2500 point mutations in the p53 gene of human tumors and cell lines which we had compiled from the published literature and made available electronically through the file server at the EMBL Data Library. This database, updated twice a year, now contains records on 4496 published mutations (July 1995 release) and can be obtained from the EMBL Outstation-the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) through the network or on CD-ROM. This report describes the criteria for inclusion of data in this database, a description of the current format and a brief discussion of the current relevance of p53 mutation analysis to clinical and biological questions.
