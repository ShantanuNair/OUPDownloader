Codon usage in 87 602 genes has been calculated using the nucleotide sequence data obtained from the GenBank Genetic Sequence Data Bank (Release 90.0; September 1995). The database is called the CUTG Database; the complete form of the database can be obtained by anonymous ftp from DDBJ and a part of the database, which lists the frequency of codon use in each organism, is made searchable through our World Wide Web server.
