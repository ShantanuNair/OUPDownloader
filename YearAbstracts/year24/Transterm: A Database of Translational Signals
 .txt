The TransTerm database of sequence contexts of stop and start codons has been expanded to include âˆ¼ 50% more species than last year's release. It now contains 148 organisms and >39 500 coding sequences; it is now available on the World Wide Web. The database includes: (i) initiation and termination sequence contexts organized by species; (ii) summary parameters about the individual sequences (sequence length, GC%, GC3, Nc, CAI) in addition to tables of base frequencies for each species' stop and start codon sequence context; (iii) species codon usage tables; and (iv) summary tables of stop signal frequency.
