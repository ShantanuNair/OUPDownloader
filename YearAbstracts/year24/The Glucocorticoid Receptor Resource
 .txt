 The glucocorticoid receptor resource focuses on the structure-function relationships of the glucocorticoid receptor. As well as links to sequence and bibliographic databases via the World Wide Web, the database contains sequence comparisons of receptors from different species and source information for glucocorticoid receptor clones, probes, cell lines and antibodies. The resource allows the electronic publication of essays, unpublished data and reviews on steroid receptors. These publications will not be reviewed or edited and should allow the rapid dissemination of information to the scientific community.
