In order to facilitate easy access to and aid understanding of the causes of haemophilia A at the molecular level we have constructed HAMSTeRS, the third release of the factor VIII mutation database and the first release of this database that may be accessed and interrogated over the internet through a World Wide Web browser. The database also presents a review of the structure and function of factor VIII and the molecular genetics of haemophilia A, a real time update of the biostatistics of each parameter in the database, a molecular model of the A1, A2 and A3 domains of the factor VIII protein (based on the crystal structure of caeruloplasmin) and a bulletin board for discussion of issues in the molecular biology of factor VIII.
