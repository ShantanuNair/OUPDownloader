Version 6.0 of the Human Genome Data Base introduces a number of significant improvements over previous releases of GDB. The most important of these are revised data representations for genes and genomic maps and a new curatorial model for the database. GDB 6.0 is the first major genomic database to provide read/write access directly to the scientific community, including capabilities for third-party annotation. The revised database can represent all major categories of genetic and physical maps, along with the underlying order and distance information used to construct them. The improved representation permits more sophisticated map queries to be posed and supports the graphical display of maps. In addition, the new GDB has a richer model for gene information, better suited for supporting cross-references to databases describing gene function, structure, products, expression and associated phenotypes.
