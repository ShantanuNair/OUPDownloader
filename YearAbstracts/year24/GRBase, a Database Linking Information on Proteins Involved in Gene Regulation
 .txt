 The Gene Regulation Database (GRBase) is a compendium of information on the structure and function of proteins involved in the control of gene expression in eukaryotes. These proteins include transcription factors, proteins involved in signal transduction, and receptors. GRBase is now accessible via the World Wide Web ( http://www.access.digex.net/âˆ¼regulate ). A key feature of this database is the linking of each entry to data in other databases. The database is also available by anonymous ftp (URL http://ftp.trevigen.com/pub/Tfactors/ ) in both text and Filemaker pro formats.
