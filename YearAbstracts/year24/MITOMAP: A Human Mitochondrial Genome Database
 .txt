 We have developed a comprehensive database (MITOMAP) for the human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the first component of the human genome to be completely sequenced [Anderson et al. (1981) Nature 290, 457â€“465]. MITOMAP uses the mtDNA sequence as the unifying element for bringing together information on mitochondrial genome structure and function, pathogenic mutations and their clinical characteristics, population associated variation, and gene-gene interactions. As increasingly larger regions of the human genome are sequenced and characterized, the need for integrating such information will grow. Consequently, MITOMAP not only provides a valuable reference for the mitochondrial biologist, it may also provide a model for the development of information storage and retrieval systems for other components of the human genome.
