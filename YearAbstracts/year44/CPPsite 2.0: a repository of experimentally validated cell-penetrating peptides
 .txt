CPPsite 2.0 (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/cppsite/) is an updated version of manually curated database (CPPsite) of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). The current version holds around 1850 peptide entries, which is nearly two times than the entries in the previous version. The updated data were curated from research papers and patents published in last three years. It was observed that most of the CPPs discovered/ tested, in last three years, have diverse chemical modifications (e.g. non-natural residues, linkers, lipid moieties, etc.). We have compiled this information on chemical modifications systematically in the updated version of the database. In order to understand the structure-function relationship of these peptides, we predicted tertiary structure of CPPs, possessing both modified and natural residues, using state-of-the-art techniques. CPPsite 2.0 also maintains information about model systems (in vitro/in vivo) used for CPP evaluation and different type of cargoes (e.g. nucleic acid, protein, nanoparticles, etc.) delivered by these peptides. In order to assist a wide range of users, we developed a user-friendly responsive website, with various tools, suitable for smartphone, tablet and desktop users. In conclusion, CPPsite 2.0 provides significant improvements over the previous version in terms of data content.
