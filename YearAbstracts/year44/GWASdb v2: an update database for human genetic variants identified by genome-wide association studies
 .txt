Genome-wide association studies (GWASs), now as a routine approach to study single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-trait association, have uncovered over ten thousand significant trait/disease associated SNPs (TASs). Here, we updated GWASdb (GWASdb v2, http://jjwanglab.org/gwasdb) which provides comprehensive data curation and knowledge integration for GWAS TASs. These updates include: (i) Up to August 2015, we collected 2479 unique publications from PubMed and other resources; (ii) We further curated moderate SNP-trait associations (P-value < 1.0×10−3) from each original publication, and generated a total of 252 530 unique TASs in all GWASdb v2 collected studies; (iii) We manually mapped 1610 GWAS traits to 501 Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, 435 Disease Ontology (DO) terms and 228 Disease Ontology Lite (DOLite) terms. For each ontology term, we also predicted the putative causal genes; (iv) We curated the detailed sub-populations and related sample size for each study; (v) Importantly, we performed extensive function annotation for each TAS by incorporating gene-based information, ENCODE ChIP-seq assays, eQTL, population haplotype, functional prediction across multiple biological domains, evolutionary signals and disease-related annotation; (vi) Additionally, we compiled a SNP-drug response association dataset for 650 pharmacogenetic studies involving 257 drugs in this update; (vii) Last, we improved the user interface of website.
