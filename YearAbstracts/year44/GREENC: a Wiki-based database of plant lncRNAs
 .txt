Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are functional non-translated molecules greater than 200 nt. Their roles are diverse and they are usually involved in transcriptional regulation. LncRNAs still remain largely uninvestigated in plants with few exceptions. Experimentally validated plant lncRNAs have been shown to regulate important agronomic traits such as phosphate starvation response, flowering time and interaction with symbiotic organisms, making them of great interest in plant biology and in breeding. There is still a lack of lncRNAs in most sequenced plant species, and in those where they have been annotated, different methods have been used, so making the lncRNAs less useful in comparisons within and between species. We developed a pipeline to annotate lncRNAs and applied it to 37 plant species and six algae, resulting in the annotation of more than 120 000 lncRNAs. To facilitate the study of lncRNAs for the plant research community, the information gathered is organised in the Green Non-Coding Database (GreeNC, http://greenc.sciencedesigners.com/).
