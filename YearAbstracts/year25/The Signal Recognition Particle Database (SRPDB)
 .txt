The SRPDB (Signal Recognition Particle Database) offers aligned SRP RNA and SRP protein sequences, phylogenetically ordered and annotated. This release adds three SRP RNA sequences (totaling 96 SRP RNA sequences) and 11 SRP protein sequences (a total of 39 protein sequences from SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP21, SRP54, SRP68 or SRP72). Also downloadable are sample SRP RNA secondary structure diagrams, a three-dimensional model of the human SRP RNA, search motifs and software.
