The Ribosomal RNA Mutation Databases (16SMDB and 23SMDB) provide lists of mutated positions in 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli and the identity of each alteration. Information provided for each mutation includes: (i) a brief description of the phenotype(s) associated with each mutation; (ii) whether a mutant phenotype has been detected by in vivo or in vitro methods; and (iii) relevant literature citations. The databases are available via ftp and on the World Wide Web. Expansion of the databases to include information about mutations isolated in organisms other than E. coli is currently in progress.
