The compilation of 5S rRNA and 5S rRNA gene nucleotide sequences as of 30 September 1996, contains a total of 1661 primary structures of 5S rRNAs or their genes, which is an increase of 928 new sequence entries over the last compilation. It covers sequences from 54 archaea, 449 eubacteria, 34 plastids, nine mitochondria and 430 eukaryotes. The databank uses the format of the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library complemented by a Sequence Alignment (SA) field including secondary structure information. The taxonomic classification of organisms was totally updated. Now the database is also available via anonymous FTP or WWW.
