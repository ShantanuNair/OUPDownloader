TransTerm is a database of initiation and termination sequence contexts from more than 250 organisms listed in GenBank, including the four complete genomes: Haemophilus influenzae, Methanococcus jannaschii, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For the current release, more than 60 000 coding sequences were analysed. The tabulated data include initiation and termination contexts organised by species along with quantitative parameters about individual coding sequences (length, %GC, GC3, Nc and CAI). There are also tables of initiation- and termination-region nucleotide-frequencies, codon usage tables and summaries of stop signal usage. TransTerm is available on the World Wide Web at: http://biochem.otago.ac.nz:800/Transterm/homepage.html
