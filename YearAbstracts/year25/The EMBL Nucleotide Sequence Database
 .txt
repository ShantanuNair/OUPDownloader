The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database is a comprehensive database of DNA and RNA sequences directly submitted from researchers and genome sequencing groups and collected from the scientific literature and patent applications. In collaboration with DDBJ and GenBank the database is produced, maintained and distributed at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and constitutes Europe's primary nucleotide sequence resource. Database releases are produced quarterly and are distributed on CD-ROM. EBI's network services allow access to the most up-to-date data collection via Internet and World Wide Web interface, providing database searching and sequence similarity facilities plus access to a large number of additional databases.
