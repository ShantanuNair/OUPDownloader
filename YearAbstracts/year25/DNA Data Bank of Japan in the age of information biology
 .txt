DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) began its activities in 1986 in collaboration with EMBL in Europe and GenBank in the United States. DDBJ developed a data submission tool called Sakura, by which researchers can submit their newly sequenced data on WWW from every corner of the world. The data bank also built a database management system (Yamato II), incorporating the techniques and functions of the object-oriented database, in order to efficiently process the data it has collected. A number of research activities in information biology are also going on at DDBJ. Two such activities are also briefly introduced in this report.
