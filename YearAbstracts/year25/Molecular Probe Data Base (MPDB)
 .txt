Molecular Probe Data Base contains detailed information on synthetic oligonucleotides with a sequence of up to 100 nucleotides. This database prevalently contains information related to human oligonucleotides used in diagnostics. Molecular Probe Data Base has been made available on-line through the Internet by means of Network Information Retrieval (NIR) tools since 1993. Two years ago, a collaboration with EMBL Data Library was also set up, so that the Molecular Probe Data Base has been integrated with other molecular biology data banks in the sphere of the SRS WWW network browser. In this paper, the most recent enhancements and the current status of the Molecular Probe Data Base are briefly presented.
