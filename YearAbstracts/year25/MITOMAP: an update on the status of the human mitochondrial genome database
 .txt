We have continued to develop MITOMAP, a comprehensive database for the human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). MITOMAP uses the mtDNA sequence as the unifying element for bringing together information on mitochondrial genome structure and function, pathogenic mutations and their clinical characteristics, population associated variation and gene-gene interactions. As increasingly larger regions of the human genome are sequenced and characterized, the need for integrating such information will grow. Consequently, MITOMAP not only provides a valuable reference for the mitochondrial biologist, it will also provide a model for the development of comprehensive, multi-media information storage and retrieval systems for other components of the human genome. This paper is an update of the changes which have occurred to MITOMAP over the past year.
