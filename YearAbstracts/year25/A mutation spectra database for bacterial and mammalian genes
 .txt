Each mutation spectrum in this database is a dataset of changes in DNA base sequence in mutations induced in a gene by a particular mutagen (including spontaneous processes) under defined conditions. There are 240 datasets with 24 500 mutants in nine bacterial genes, two phage genes, five mammalian genes and one yeast gene. The database is available on the Web at http://info.med.yale.edu/mutbase/. The data tables can be viewed on the Web and downloaded in text form for local use. The data are also available in dBASE III, a format which can be utilized by essentially any desktop computer database program or spreadsheet, and makes feasible analyses of a large number of mutants. Researchers are invited to submit additional data. A data entry program, MUTSIN, diagrams each mutation on the computer screen as the data are entered and alerts the user to any discrepancies between the entry and the gene sequence.
