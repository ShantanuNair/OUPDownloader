In the context of the international project aiming at sequencing the whole genome of Bacillus subtilis we have developed NRSub, a non-redundant database of sequences from this organism. Starting from the B.subtilis sequences available in the repository collections we have removed all encountered duplications, then we have added extra annotations to the sequences (e.g. accession numbers for the genes, locations on the genetic map, codon usage index). We have also added cross-references with EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ, MEDLINE, SWISS-PROT and ENZYME databases. NRSub is distributed through anonymous FTP as a text file in EMBL format and as an ACNUC database. It is also possible to access the database through two dedicated World Wide Web servers located in France (http://acnuc.univ-lyon1.fr/nrsub/nrsub.html) and in Japan (http://ddbjs4h.genes.nig.ac.jp/).
