GIF-DB (Gene Interactions in the Fly Database) is a new WWW database (http://www-biol.univ-mrs.fr/âˆ¼lgpd/GIFTS_home_page.html) describing gene molecular interactions involved in the process of embryonic pattern formation in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. The detailed information is distributed in specific lines arranged into an EMBL- (or SWISS-PROT-) like format. GIF-DB achieves a high level of integration with other databases such as FlyBase, EMBL and SWISS-PROT through numerous hyperlinks. The original concept of interaction databases examplified by GIF-DB could be extended to other biological subjects and organisms so as to study gene regulatory networks in an evolutionary perspective.
