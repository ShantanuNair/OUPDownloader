The small RNA database is a compilation of all the small size RNA sequences available to date, including nuclear, nucleolar, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial small RNAs from eukaryotic organisms and small RNAs from prokaryotic cells as well as viruses. Currently, about 600 small RNA sequences are in our database. It also gives the sources of individual RNAs and their GenBank accession numbers. The small RNA database can be accessed through WWW(World Wide Web). Our WWW URL address is: http://mbcr.bcm.tmc.edu/smallRNA/smallrna.html. The new small RNA sequences published since our last compilation are listed in this paper.
