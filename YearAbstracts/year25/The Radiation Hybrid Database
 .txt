Since July 1995, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) has maintained RHdb, a public database for radiation hybrid data. Radiation hybrid data are used in the generation of alternative genetic maps as they can include non-polymorphic markers and are also powerful enough to order unresolved genetic clusters of polymorphic STSs. The EBI is an Outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).
