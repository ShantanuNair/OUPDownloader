Ribonuclease P is responsible for the removal of leader sequences from tRNA precursors. Ribonuclease P is a ribonucleoprotein, and in bacteria the RNA subunit alone is catalytically active in vitro, i.e. it is a ribozyme. The Ribonuclease P Database is a compilation of ribonuclease P sequences, sequence alignments, secondary structures, three-dimensional models, and accessory information, available via the World Wide Web.
