The value of the Genome Database (GDB) for the human genome research community has been greatly increased since the release of version 6.0 last year. Thanks to the introduction of significant technical improvements, GDB has seen dramatic growth in the type and volume of information stored in the database. This article summarizes the types of data that are now available in the Genome Database, demonstrates how the database is interconnected with other biomedical resources on the World Wide Web, discusses how researchers can contribute new or updated information to the database, and describes our current efforts as well as planned improvements for the future.
