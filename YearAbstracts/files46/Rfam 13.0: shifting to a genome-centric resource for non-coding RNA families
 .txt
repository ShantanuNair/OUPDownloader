The Rfam database is a collection of RNA families in which each family is represented by a multiple sequence alignment, a consensus secondary structure, and a covariance model. In this paper we introduce Rfam release 13.0, which switches to a new genome-centric approach that annotates a non-redundant set of reference genomes with RNA families. We describe new web interface features including faceted text search and R-scape secondary structure visualizations. We discuss a new literature curation workflow and a pipeline for building families based on RNAcentral. There are 236 new families in release 13.0, bringing the total number of families to 2687.
