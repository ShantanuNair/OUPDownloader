NONCODE (http://www.bioinfo.org/noncode/) is a systematic database that is dedicated to presenting the most complete collection and annotation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Since NONCODE 2016 was released two years ago, the amount of novel identified ncRNAs has been enlarged by the reduced cost of next-generation sequencing, which has produced an explosion of newly identified data. The third-generation sequencing revolution has also offered longer and more accurate annotations. Moreover, accumulating evidence confirmed by biological experiments has provided more comprehensive knowledge of lncRNA functions. The ncRNA data set was expanded by collecting newly identified ncRNAs from literature published over the past two years and integration of the latest versions of RefSeq and Ensembl. Additionally, pig was included in the database for the first time, bringing the total number of species to 17. The number of lncRNAs in NONCODEv5 increased from 527 336 to 548 640. NONCODEv5 also introduced three important new features: (i) human lncRNA–disease relationships and single nucleotide polymorphism-lncRNA–disease relationships were constructed; (ii) human exosome lncRNA expression profiles were displayed; (iii) the RNA secondary structures of NONCODE human transcripts were predicted. NONCODEv5 is also accessible through http://www.noncode.org/.
