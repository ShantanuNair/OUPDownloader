Soluble functional proteins may transform into insoluble amyloid fibrils that deposit in a variety of tissues. Amyloid formation is a hallmark of age-related degenerative disorders. Perhaps surprisingly, amyloid fibrils can also be beneficial and are frequently exploited for diverse functional roles in organisms. Here we introduce AmyPro, an open-access database providing a comprehensive, carefully curated collection of validated amyloid fibril-forming proteins from all kingdoms of life classified into broad functional categories (http://amypro.net). In particular, AmyPro provides the boundaries of experimentally validated amyloidogenic sequence regions, short descriptions of the functional relevance of the proteins and their amyloid state, a list of the experimental techniques applied to study the amyloid state, important structural/functional/variation/mutation data transferred from UniProt, a list of relevant PDB structures categorized according to protein states, database cross-references and literature references. AmyPro greatly improves on similar currently available resources by incorporating both prions and functional amyloids in addition to pathogenic amyloids, and allows users to screen their sequences against the entire collection of validated amyloidogenic sequence fragments. By enabling further elucidation of the sequential determinants of amyloid fibril formation, we hope AmyPro will enhance the development of new methods for the precise prediction of amyloidogenic regions within proteins.
