We developed jMorp, a new database containing metabolome and proteome data for plasma obtained from >5000 healthy Japanese volunteers from the Tohoku Medical Megabank Cohort Study, which is available at https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp. Metabolome data were measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS), while proteome data were obtained by nanoLC–MS. We released the concentration distributions of 37 metabolites identified by NMR, distributions of peak intensities of 257 characterized metabolites by LC–MS, and observed frequencies of 256 abundant proteins. Additionally, correlation networks for the metabolites can be observed using an interactive network viewer. Compared with some existing databases, jMorp has some unique features: (i) Metabolome data were obtained using a single protocol in a single institute, ensuring that measurement biases were significantly minimized; (ii) The database contains large-scale data for healthy volunteers with various health records and genome data and (iii) Correlations between metabolites can be easily observed using the graphical viewer. Metabolites data are becoming important intermediate markers for evaluating the health states of humans, and thus jMorp is an outstanding resource for a wide range of researchers, particularly those in the fields of medical science, applied molecular biology, and biochemistry.
