This release of the FunCoup database (http://funcoup.sbc.su.se) is the fourth generation of one of the most comprehensive databases for genome-wide functional association networks. These functional associations are inferred via integrating various data types using a naive Bayesian algorithm and orthology based information transfer across different species. This approach provides high coverage of the included genomes as well as high quality of inferred interactions. In this update of FunCoup we introduce four new eukaryotic species: Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Bos taurus, Oryza sativa and open the database to the prokaryotic domain by including networks for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The latter allows us to also introduce a new class of functional association between genes - co-occurrence in the same operon. We also supplemented the existing classes of functional association: metabolic, signaling, complex and physical protein interaction with up-to-date information. In this release we switched to InParanoid v8 as the source of orthology and base for calculation of phylogenetic profiles. While populating all other evidence types with new data we introduce a new evidence type based on quantitative mass spectrometry data. Finally, the new JavaScript based network viewer provides the user an intuitive and responsive platform to further evaluate the results.
