Accumulating evidence suggests that diverse non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in the progression of a wide variety of diseases. In recent years, abundant ncRNA–disease associations have been found and predicted according to experiments and prediction algorithms. Diverse ncRNA–disease associations are scattered over many resources and mammals, whereas a global view of diverse ncRNA–disease associations is not available for any mammals. Hence, we have updated the MNDR v2.0 database (www.rna-society.org/mndr/) by integrating experimental and prediction associations from manual literature curation and other resources under one common framework. The new developments in MNDR v2.0 include (i) an over 220-fold increase in ncRNA–disease associations enhancement compared with the previous version (including lncRNA, miRNA, piRNA, snoRNA and more than 1400 diseases); (ii) integrating experimental and prediction evidence from 14 resources and prediction algorithms for each ncRNA–disease association; (iii) mapping disease names to the Disease Ontology and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH); (iv) providing a confidence score for each ncRNA–disease association and (v) an increase of species coverage to six mammals. Finally, MNDR v2.0 intends to provide the scientific community with a resource for efficient browsing and extraction of the associations between diverse ncRNAs and diseases, including >260 000 ncRNA–disease associations.
