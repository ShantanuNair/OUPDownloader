The Structural T–cell Receptor Database (STCRDab; http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/stcrdab) is an online resource that automatically collects and curates TCR structural data from the Protein Data Bank. For each entry, the database provides annotations, such as the α/β or γ/δ chain pairings, major histocompatibility complex details, and where available, antigen binding affinities. In addition, the orientation between the variable domains and the canonical forms of the complementarity-determining region loops are also provided. Users can select, view, and download individual or bulk sets of structures based on these criteria. Where available, STCRDab also finds antibody structures that are similar to TCRs, helping users explore the relationship between TCRs and antibodies.
