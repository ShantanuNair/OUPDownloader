RNArchitecture is a database that provides a comprehensive description of relationships between known families of structured non-coding RNAs, with a focus on structural similarities. The classification is hierarchical and similar to the system used in the SCOP and CATH databases of protein structures. Its central level is Family, which builds on the Rfam catalog and gathers closely related RNAs. Consensus structures of Families are described with a reduced secondary structure representation. Evolutionarily related Families are grouped into Superfamilies. Similar structures are further grouped into Architectures. The highest level, Class, organizes families into very broad structural categories, such as simple or complex structured RNAs. Some groups at different levels of the hierarchy are currently labeled as ‘unclassified’. The classification is expected to evolve as new data become available. For each Family with an experimentally determined three-diemsional (3D) structure(s), a representative one is provided. RNArchitecture also presents theoretical models of RNA 3D structure and is open for submission of structural models by users. Compared to other databases, RNArchitecture is unique in its focus on structure-based RNA classification, and in providing a platform for storing RNA 3D structure predictions.
