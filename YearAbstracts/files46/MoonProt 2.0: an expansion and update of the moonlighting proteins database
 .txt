MoonProt 2.0 (http://moonlightingproteins.org) is an updated, comprehensive and open-access database storing expert-curated annotations for moonlighting proteins. Moonlighting proteins contain two or more physiologically relevant distinct functions performed by a single polypeptide chain. Here, we describe developments in the MoonProt website and database since our previous report in the Database Issue of Nucleic Acids Research. For this V 2.0 release, we expanded the number of proteins annotated to 370 and modified several dozen protein annotations with additional or updated information, including more links to protein structures in the Protein Data Bank, compared with the previous release. The new entries include more examples from humans and several model organisms, more proteins involved in disease, and proteins with different combinations of functions. The updated web interface includes a search function using BLAST to enable users to search the database for proteins that share amino acid sequence similarity with a protein of interest. The updated website also includes additional background information about moonlighting proteins and an expanded list of links to published articles about moonlighting proteins.
