Increasing evidence reveals that diverse non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play critically important roles in viral infection. Viruses can use diverse ncRNAs to manipulate both cellular and viral gene expression to establish a host environment conducive to the completion of the viral life cycle. Many host cellular ncRNAs can also directly or indirectly influence viral replication and even target virus genomes. ViRBase (http://www.rna-society.org/virbase) aims to provide the scientific community with a resource for efficient browsing and visualization of virus-host ncRNA-associated interactions and interaction networks in viral infection. The current version of ViRBase documents more than 12 000 viral and cellular ncRNA-associated virus–virus, virus–host, host–virus and host–host interactions involving more than 460 non-redundant ncRNAs and 4400 protein-coding genes from between more than 60 viruses and 20 hosts. Users can query, browse and manipulate these virus–host ncRNA-associated interactions. ViRBase will be of help in uncovering the generic organizing principles of cellular virus–host ncRNA-associated interaction networks in viral infection.
