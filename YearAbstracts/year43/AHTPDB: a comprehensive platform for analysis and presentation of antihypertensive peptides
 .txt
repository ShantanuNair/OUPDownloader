AHTPDB (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/ahtpdb/) is a manually curated database of experimentally validated antihypertensive peptides. Information pertaining to peptides with antihypertensive activity was collected from research articles and from various peptide repositories. These peptides were derived from 35 major sources that include milk, egg, fish, pork, chicken, soybean, etc. In AHTPDB, most of the peptides belong to a family of angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibiting peptides. The current release of AHTPDB contains 5978 peptide entries among which 1694 are unique peptides. Each entry provides detailed information about a peptide like sequence, inhibitory concentration (IC50), toxicity/bitterness value, source, length, molecular mass and information related to purification of peptides. In addition, the database provides structural information of these peptides that includes predicted tertiary and secondary structures. A user-friendly web interface with various tools has been developed to retrieve and analyse the data. It is anticipated that AHTPDB will be a useful and unique resource for the researchers working in the field of antihypertensive peptides.
