DBTMEE (http://dbtmee.hgc.jp/) is a searchable and browsable database designed to manipulate gene expression information from our ultralarge-scale whole-transcriptome analysis of mouse early embryos. Since integrative approaches with multiple public analytical data have become indispensable for studying embryogenesis due to technical challenges such as biological sample collection, we intend DBTMEE to be an integrated gateway for the research community. To do so, we combined the gene expression profile with various public resources. Thereby, users can extensively investigate molecular characteristics among totipotent, pluripotent and differentiated cells while taking genetic and epigenetic characteristics into consideration. We have also designed user friendly web interfaces that enable users to access the data quickly and easily. DBTMEE will help to promote our understanding of the enigmatic fertilization dynamics.
