The Standard European Vector Architecture 2.0 database (SEVA-DB 2.0, http://seva.cnb.csic.es) is an improved and expanded version of the platform released in 2013 (doi: 10.1093/nar/gks1119) aimed at assisting the choice of optimal genetic tools for de-constructing and re-constructing complex prokaryotic phenotypes. By adopting simple compositional rules, the SEVA standard facilitates combinations of functional DNA segments that ease both the analysis and the engineering of diverse Gram-negative bacteria for fundamental or biotechnological purposes. The large number of users of the SEVA-DB during its first two years of existence has resulted in a valuable feedback that we have exploited for fixing DNA sequence errors, improving the nomenclature of the SEVA plasmids, expanding the vector collection, adding new features to the web interface and encouraging contributions of materials from the community of users. The SEVA platform is also adopting the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) for electronic-like description of the constructs available in the collection and their interfacing with genetic devices developed by other Synthetic Biology communities. We advocate the SEVA format as one interim asset for the ongoing transition of genetic design of microorganisms from being a trial-and-error endeavor to become an authentic engineering discipline.
