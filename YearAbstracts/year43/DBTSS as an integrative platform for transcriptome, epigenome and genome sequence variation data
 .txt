DBTSS (http://dbtss.hgc.jp/) was originally constructed as a collection of uniquely determined transcriptional start sites (TSSs) in humans and some other species in 2002. Since then, it has been regularly updated and in recent updates epigenetic information has also been incorporated because such information is useful for characterizing the biological relevance of these TSSs/downstream genes. In the newest release, Release 9, we further integrated public and original single nucleotide variation (SNV) data into our database. For our original data, we generated SNV data from genomic analyses of various cancer types, including 97 lung adenocarcinomas and 57 lung small cell carcinomas from Japanese patients as well as 26 cell lines of lung cancer origin. In addition, we obtained publically available SNV data from other cancer types and germline variations in total of 11,322 individuals. With these updates, users can examine the association between sequence variation pattern in clinical lung cancers with its corresponding TSS-seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and BS-seq data. Consequently, DBTSS is no longer a mere storage site for TSS information but has evolved into an integrative platform of a variety of genome activity data.
