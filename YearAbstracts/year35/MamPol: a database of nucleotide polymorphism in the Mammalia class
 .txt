Multi-locus and multi-species nucleotide diversity studies would benefit enormously from a public database encompassing high-quality haplotypic sequences with their associated genetic diversity measures. MamPol, ‘Mammalia Polymorphism Database’, is a website containing all the well-annotated polymorphic sequences available in GenBank for the Mammalia class grouped by name of organism and gene. Diversity measures of single nucleotide polymorphisms are provided for each set of haplotypic homologous sequences, including polymorphism at synonymous and non-synonymous sites, linkage disequilibrium and codon bias. Data gathering, calculation of diversity measures and daily updates are automatically performed using PDA software. The MamPol website includes several interfaces for browsing the contents of the database and making customizable comparative searches of different species or taxonomic groups. It also contains a set of tools for simple re-analysis of the available data and a statistics section that is updated daily and summarizes the contents of the database. MamPol is available at  and can be downloaded via FTP.
