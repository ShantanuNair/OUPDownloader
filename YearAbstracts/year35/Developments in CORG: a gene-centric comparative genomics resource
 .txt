The CORG resource (Comparative Regulatory Genomics, ) provides extensive cross-species comparisons of promoter regions in particular and whole gene loci in general. Pairwise as well as multiple alignments of 10 vertebrate species form the key component of CORG. We implemented a rapid alignment approach based on weight matrix motif anchors to ensure efficient computation and biologically informative alignments. All CORG workbench components have been enhanced towards more flexibility and interactivity. Reference sequence based data presentation and analysis was put into the well-known and modular Generic Genome Browser framework. Herein, various plugins facilitate online data analysis and integration with static conservation data. Main emphasis was put on the design of a new JAVA WebStart application for comparative data display. Flexible data import and export options for standard formats complete the provided services.
