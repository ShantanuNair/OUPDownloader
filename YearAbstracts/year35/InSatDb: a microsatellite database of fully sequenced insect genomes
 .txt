InSatDb presents an interactive interface to query information regarding microsatellite characteristics per se of five fully sequenced insect genomes (fruit-fly, honeybee, malarial mosquito, red-flour beetle and silkworm). InSatDb allows users to obtain microsatellites annotated with size (in base pairs and repeat units); genomic location (exon, intron, up-stream or transposon); nature (perfect or imperfect); and sequence composition (repeat motif and GC%). One can access microsatellite cluster (compound repeats) information and a list of microsatellites with conserved flanking sequences (microsatellite family or paralogs). InSatDb is complete with the insects information, web links to find details, methodology and a tutorial. A separate ‘Analysis’ section illustrates the comparative genomic analysis that can be carried out using the output. InSatDb is available at .
