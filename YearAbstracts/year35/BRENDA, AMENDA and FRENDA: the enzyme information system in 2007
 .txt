The BRENDA (BRaunschweig ENzyme DAtabase) enzyme information system () is the largest publicly available enzyme information system worldwide. The major parts of its contents are manually extracted from primary literature. It is not restricted to specific groups of enzymes, but includes information on all identified enzymes irrespective of the enzyme's source. The range of data encompasses functional, structural, sequence, localisation, disease-related, isolation, stability information on enzyme and ligand-related data. Each single entry is linked to the enzyme source and to a literature reference. Recently the data repository was complemented by text-mining data in AMENDA (Automatic Mining of ENzyme DAta) and FRENDA (Full Reference ENzyme DAta). A genome browser, membrane protein prediction and full-text search capacities were added. The newly implemented web service provides instant access to the data for programmers via a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) interface. The BRENDA data can be downloaded in the form of a text file from the beginning of 2007.
