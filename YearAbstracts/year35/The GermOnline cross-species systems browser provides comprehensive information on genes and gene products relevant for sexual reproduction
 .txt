We report a novel release of the GermOnline knowledgebase covering genes relevant for the cell cycle, gametogenesis and fertility. GermOnline was extended into a cross-species systems browser including information on DNA sequence annotation, gene expression and the function of gene products. The database covers eight model organisms and Homo sapiens, for which complete genome annotation data are available. The database is now built around a sophisticated genome browser (Ensembl), our own microarray information management and annotation system (MIMAS) used to extensively describe experimental data obtained with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChips) and a comprehensive system for online editing of database entries (MediaWiki). The RNA data include results from classical microarrays as well as tiling arrays that yield information on RNA expression levels, transcript start sites and lengths as well as exon composition. Members of the research community are solicited to help GermOnline curators keep database entries on genes and gene products complete and accurate. The database is accessible at .
