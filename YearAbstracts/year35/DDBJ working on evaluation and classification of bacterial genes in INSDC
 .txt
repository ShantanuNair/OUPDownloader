DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) () newly collected and released 12 927 184 entries or 13 787 688 598 bases in the period from July 2005 to June 2006. The released data contain honeybee expressed sequence tags (ESTs), re-examined and re-annotated complete genome data of Escherichia coli K-12 W3110, medaka WGS and human MGA. We also systematically evaluated and classified the genes in the complete bacterial genomes submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, ) that is composed of DDBJ, EMBL Bank and GenBank. The examination and classification selected 557 000 genes as reliable ones among all the bacterial genes predicted by us.
