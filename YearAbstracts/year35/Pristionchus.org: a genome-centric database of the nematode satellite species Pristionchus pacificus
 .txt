Comparative studies have been of invaluable importance to the understanding of evolutionary biology. The evolution of developmental programs can be studied in nematodes at a single cell resolution given their fixed cell lineage. We have established Pristionchus pacificus as a major satellite organism for evolutionary developmental biology relative to Caenorhabditis elegans, the model nematode. Online genomic information to support studies in this satellite system can be accessed at . Our web resource offers diverse content covering genome browsing, genetic and physical maps, similarity searches, a community platform and assembly details. Content will be continuously improved as we annotate the P.pacificus genome, and will be an indispensable resource for P.pacificus genomics.
