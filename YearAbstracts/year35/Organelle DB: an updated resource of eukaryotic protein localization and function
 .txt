Organelle DB () is a web-accessible relational database presenting a supplemented catalog of organelle-localized proteins and major protein complexes. Since its release in 2004, Organelle DB has grown by 20% to encompass over 30 000 proteins from 138 eukaryotic organisms. Each protein in Organelle DB is presented with its subcellular localization, primary sequence and a detailed description of its function, as available. All records in Organelle DB have been annotated using controlled vocabulary from the Gene Ontology consortium. Protein localization data are inherently visual, and Organelle DB is a significant repository of biological images, housing 1500 micrographs of yeast cells carrying stained proteins. Furthermore, we report here the development of Organelle View, an extension of Organelle DB for the interactive visualization of organelles and subcellular structures in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Organelle View offers a dimensional representation of a yeast cell; users can search Organelle View for proteins of interest, and the organelles housing these proteins will be highlighted in the cell image. Among other applications, Organelle View may serve as an educational aid engaging introductory biology students through a visually ‘fun’ interface. Organelle View can be accessed from the Organelle DB home page or directly at .
