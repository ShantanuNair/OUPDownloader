Genome Information Broker for Viruses (GIB-V) is a comprehensive virus genome/segment database. We extracted 18â€‰418 complete virus genomes/segments from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, ) by DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), EMBL and GenBank and stored them in our system. The list of registered viruses is arranged hierarchically according to taxonomy. Keyword searches can be performed for genome/segment data or biological features of any virus stored in GIB-V. GIB-V is equipped with a BLAST search function, and search results are displayed graphically or in list form. Moreover, the BLAST results can be used online with the ClustalW feature of the DDBJ. All available virus genome/segment data can be collected by the GIB-V download function. GIB-V can be accessed at no charge at .
