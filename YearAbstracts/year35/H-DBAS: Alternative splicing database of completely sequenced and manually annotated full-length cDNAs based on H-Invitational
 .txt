The Human-transcriptome DataBase for Alternative Splicing (H-DBAS) is a specialized database of alternatively spliced human transcripts. In this database, each of the alternative splicing (AS) variants corresponds to a completely sequenced and carefully annotated human full-length cDNA, one of those collected for the H-Invitational human-transcriptome annotation meeting. H-DBAS contains 38 664 representative alternative splicing variants (RASVs) in 11 744 loci, in total. The data is retrievable by various features of AS, which were annotated according to manual annotations, such as by patterns of ASs, consequently invoked alternations in the encoded amino acids and affected protein motifs, GO terms, predicted subcellular localization signals and transmembrane domains. The database also records recently identified very complex patterns of AS, in which two distinct genes seemed to be bridged, nested or degenerated (multiple CDS): in all three cases, completely unrelated proteins are encoded by a single locus. By using AS Viewer, each AS event can be analyzed in the context of full-length cDNAs, enabling the user's empirical understanding of the relation between AS event and the consequent alternations in the encoded amino acid sequences together with various kinds of affected protein motifs.
