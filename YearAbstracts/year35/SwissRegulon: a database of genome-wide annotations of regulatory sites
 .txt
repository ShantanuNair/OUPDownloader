SwissRegulon () is a database containing genome-wide annotations of regulatory sites in the intergenic regions of genomes. The regulatory site annotations are produced using a number of recently developed algorithms that operate on multiple alignments of orthologous intergenic regions from related genomes in combination with, whenever available, known sites from the literature, and ChIP-on-chip binding data. Currently SwissRegulon contains annotations for yeast and 17 prokaryotic genomes. The database provides information about the sequence, location, orientation, posterior probability and, whenever available, binding factor of each annotated site. To enable easy viewing of the regulatory site annotations in the context of other features annotated on the genomes, the sites are displayed using the GBrowse genome browser interface and can be queried based on any annotated genomic feature. The database can also be queried for regulons, i.e. sites bound by a common factor.
