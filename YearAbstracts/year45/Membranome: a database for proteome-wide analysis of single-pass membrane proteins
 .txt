The Membranome database was developed to assist analysis and computational modeling of single-pass (bitopic) transmembrane (TM) proteins and their complexes by providing structural information about these proteins on a genomic scale. The database currently collects data on >6000 bitopic proteins from Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, Dictyostelium discoideum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. It presents the following data: (i) hierarchical classification of bitopic proteins into 15 functional classes, 689 structural superfamilies and 1404 families; (ii) 446 complexes of bitopic proteins with known three-dimensional (3D) structures classified into 129 families; (iii) computationally generated three-dimensional models of TM Î±-helices positioned in membranes; (iv) amino acid sequences, domain architecture, functional annotation and available experimental structures of bitopic proteins; (v) TM topology and intracellular localization, (vi) physical interactions between proteins from the database along with links to other resources. The database is freely accessible at http://membranome.org. There is a variety of options for browsing, sorting, searching and retrieval of the content, including downloadable coordinate files of TM domains with calculated membrane boundaries.
