In the last decade, miRNAs and their regulatory mechanisms have been intensively studied and many tools for the analysis of miRNAs and their targets have been developed. We previously presented a dictionary on single miRNAs and their putative target pathways. Since then, the number of miRNAs has tripled and the knowledge on miRNAs and targets has grown substantially. This, along with changes in pathway resources such as KEGG, leads to an improved understanding of miRNAs, their target genes and related pathways. Here, we introduce the miRNA Pathway Dictionary Database (miRPathDB), freely accessible at https://mpd.bioinf.uni-sb.de/. With the database we aim to complement available target pathway web-servers by providing researchers easy access to the information which pathways are regulated by a miRNA, which miRNAs target a pathway and how specific these regulations are. The database contains a large number of miRNAs (2595 human miRNAs), different miRNA target sets (14 773 experimentally validated target genes as well as 19 281 predicted targets genes) and a broad selection of functional biochemical categories (KEGG-, WikiPathways-, BioCarta-, SMPDB-, PID-, Reactome pathways, functional categories from gene ontology (GO), protein families from Pfam and chromosomal locations totaling 12 875 categories). In addition to Homo sapiens, also Mus musculus data are stored and can be compared to human target pathways.
