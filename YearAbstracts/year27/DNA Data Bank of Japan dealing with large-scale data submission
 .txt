The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (http//:www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) has developed a software system for mass submissions to cope with a recent expansion of EST and genome data submissions. The system is composed of four parts, the www data submission, large-scale submission, submission management and storing. Using this system one can submit data on a large number of sequences or a very long sequence while checking the consistency between the annotation and sequence without much effort. DDBJ has received large scale data of Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis and Pyrococcus from Japanese researchers who made full use of the new submission system.
