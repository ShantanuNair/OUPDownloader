The sixth release of the SBASE protein domain library sequences contains 130 703 annotated and crossreferenced entries corresponding to structural, functional, ligand-binding and topogenic segments of proteins. The entries were grouped based on standard names (2312 groups) and futher classified on the basis of the BLAST similarity (2463 clusters). Automated searching with BLAST and a new sequence-plot representation of local domain similarities are available at the www-server http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/sbase. A mirror site is at http://sbase.abc.hu/sbase. The database is freely available by anonymous ‘ftp’ file transfer from ftp.icgeb.trieste.it
