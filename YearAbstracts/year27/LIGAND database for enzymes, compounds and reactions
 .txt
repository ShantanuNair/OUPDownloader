LIGAND is a composite database consisting of three sections and containing the information of chemical substances, chemical reactions and enzymes that catalyze reactions. The COMPOUND section is a collection of metabolic compounds, as well as macromolecules, chemical elements and other chemical substances in a living cell. The ENZYME section is a collection of all known enzymatic reactions, together with the information of enzyme molecules, classified according to the EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers. The REACTION section is a new addition to the database containing metabolic reactions that appear in the pathway diagrams of the KEGG/PATHWAY database and/or in the ENZYME section. The LIGAND database can be accessed through the WWW (http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget/ligand.html) or may be downloaded by anonymous FTP (ftp://kegg.genome.ad.jp/molecules/ligand/).
