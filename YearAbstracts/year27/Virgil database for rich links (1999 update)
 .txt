With so many databases available for research in the Human Genome Project, it is crucial to efficiently relate information from different resources. For that purpose, we maintain Virgil, a database of rich links for data browsing, data analysis and database interconnection. Virgil current version contains more than 40 000 rich links from five major databases: SWISS-PROT, GenBank, PDB, GDB and OMIM. Materials described in this paper are available from http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/virgil/
