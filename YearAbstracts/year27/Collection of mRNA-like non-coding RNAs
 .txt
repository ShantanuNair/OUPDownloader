In last few years much data has accumulated which shows that in different cells various RNA transcripts are synthesized. They lack protein coding capacity and do not produce mature protein. It seems that they work mainly or exclusively on the RNA level. Their function and mechanism of action is poorly understood. In this paper we have collected all known RNA transcript and prepared a database for further structural and functional studies. This is the first collection of the nucleotide sequences of RNAs of this kind. The data can be accessed via WWW at: http://www.man.poznan.pl/5SData/ncRNA/index.html
