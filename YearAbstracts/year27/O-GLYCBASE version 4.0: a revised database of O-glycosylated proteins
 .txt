O-GLYCBASE is a database of glycoproteins with O-linked glycosylation sites. entries with at least one experimentally verified O-glycosylation site have been compiled from protein sequence databases and literature. Each entry contains information about the glycan involved, the species, sequence, a literature reference and http-linked cross-references to other databases. Version 4.0 contains 179 protein entries, an approximate 15% increase over the last version. Sequence logos representing the acceptor specificity patterns for GaLNAc, GlcNAc, mannosyl and xylosyl transferases are shown. the O-GLYCBASE database is available through the WWW at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/OGLYCBASE/
