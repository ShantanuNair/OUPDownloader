This is an online database to facilitate research on viroid, viroid-like RNAs and human hepatitis delta virus (VHDV) by presenting a large number of sequences and related data in a comprehensive and user-friendly format (e.g. position of their self-catalytic domains, open reading frame of the vHDV, prediction of the most stable secondary structures, etc.). Most of these RNA species share a common proposed replication pattern known as a DNA-independent rolling circle mechanism. Together, these species form the ‘brotherhood’ of the smallest known auto-replicable RNAS. This online database is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.callisto.si.usherb.ca/~jpperra
