As of September, 1998, a total of 43 sequences are contained within the tmRNA database (tmRDB). the tmRNA sequences are arranged alphabetically and ordered phylogenetically. The alignment of the tmRNAS emphasizes the basepairs that are supported by comparative sequence analysis and establishes minimal secondary structures for the known tmRNAs. A corresponding alignment of the predicted tmrnaencoded tag peptides is presented. the tmRDB also offers a small number of RNA secondary structure diagrams and PDB-formatted three-dimensional models generated with the program ERNA-3D. The data are available freely at the URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/tmRDB/tmRDB.html
