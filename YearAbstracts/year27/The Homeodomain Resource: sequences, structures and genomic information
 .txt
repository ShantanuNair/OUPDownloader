The Homeodomain Resource is a comprehensive collection of sequence, structure and genomic information on the homeodomain protein family. Available through the resource are both full-length and domain-only sequence data, as well as X-ray and NMR structural data for proteins and protein-DNA complexes. Also available is information on human genetic diseases and disorders in which proteins from the homeodomain family play an important role; genomic information includes relevant gene symbols, cytogenetic map locations, and specific mutation data. Search engines are provided to allow users to easily query the component databases and assemble specialized data sets. The Homeodomain Resource is available through the World Wide Web at http://genome.nhgri.nih.gov/homeodomain
