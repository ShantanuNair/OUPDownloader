The RNA editing process within the mitochondria of kinetoplastid organisms is controlled by small, trans-acting RNA molecules referred to as guide RNAs. the guide RNA database is a compilation of published guide RNA sequences, currently containing 254 entries from 11 different organisms. Additional information includes RNA secondary and tertiary structure models, information on the gene localisation, literature citations and other relevant facts. The database can be accessed through the World Wide Web (www) at http://www.biochem.mpg.de/~goeringe/
