Since the obtention of the complete sequence of Haemophilus influenzae Rd in 1995, the number of bacterial genomes entirely sequenced has regularly increased. A problem is that the quality of the annotations of these very large sequences is usually lower than those of the shorter entries encountered in the repository collections. Moreover, classical sequence database management systems have difficulties in handling entries of that size. In this context, we have decided to build the Enhanced Microbial Genomes Library (EMGLib) in which these two problems are alleviated. This library contains all the complete genomes from bacteria already sequenced and the yeast genome in GenBank format. The annotations are improved by the introduction of data on codon usage, gene orientation on the chromosome and gene families. It is possible to access emglib through two database systems set up on World Wide Web servers: the PBIL server at http://pbil.univlyon1.fr/emglib/emglib.html and the MICADO server at http://locus.jouy.inra.fr/micado
