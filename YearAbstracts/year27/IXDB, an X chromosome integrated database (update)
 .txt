Chromosome specific databases are an important research tool as they integrate data from different directions, such as genetic and physical mapping data, expression data, sequences etc. They supplement the genome-wide repositories in molecular biology, such as GenBank, Swiss-Prot or OMIM, which usually concentrate on one type of information. The Integrated X Chromosome Database (IXDB, http://ixdb.mpimgberlin-dahlem.mpg.de/ ) is a repository for physical mapping data of the human X chromosome and aims at providing a global view of genomic data at a chromosomal level. We present here an update of IXDB which includes schema extensions for storing submaps and sequence information, additional links to external databases, and the integration of an increasing number of physical and transcript mapping data. The gene data was completely updated according to the approved gene symbols of the HUGO Nomenclature Committee. IXDB receives over 1000 queries per month, an indication that its content is valuable to researchers seeking mapping data of the human X chromosome.
