HvrBase is a compilation of human and ape mtDNA control region sequences. Sequences and related information on individuals, such as from where the sequences were obtained, is stored in three ASCii files as described previously. Moreover, the collection is also available as Mac/PC database application with a graphical user interface. It can be accessed through the WWW at URL http://www.eva.mpg.de/hvrbase. The current collection comprises 5846 human sequences from hypervariable region I (HVRI) and 2302 human sequences from hypervariable region II (HVRII). From apes, 295 HVRI sequences and 13 HVRII sequences are available.
