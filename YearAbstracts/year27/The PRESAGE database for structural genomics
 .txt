The PRESAGE database is a collaborative resource for structural genomics. It provides a database of proteins to which researchers add annotations indicating current experimental status, structural predictions and suggestions. The database is intended to enhance communication among structural genomics researchers and aid dissemination of their results. The PRESAGE database may be accessed at http://presage.stanford.edu/
