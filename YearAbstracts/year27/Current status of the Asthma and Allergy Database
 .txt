The database provides an online resource for access to data on the genetics of asthma and allergy. This report describes the present status of the site. Currently, a detailed description of 88 linkage studies (7164 linkage positions) and 72 mutation studies are available. The results can be accessed in table form or graphically. The database also contains mouse asthma studies and human homology relationships, gene expression studies and links to relevant patents. Technical details about the server architecture, database installation, database construction, database structure and the user interface are explained elsewhere [Wjst and Immervoll (1998) Bioinformatics, 14, 827â€“828].
