Because the number of post-translational modifications requiring standardized annotation in the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database was large and steadily increasing, a database of protein structure modifications was constructed in 1993 to assist in producing appropriate feature annotations for covalent binding sites, modified sites and cross-links. In 1995 RESID was publicly released as a PIR-international text database distributed on CD-ROM and accessible through the ATLAS program. In 1998 it was made available on the PIR Web site at http://wwwnbrf.georgetown.edu/pir/searchdb.html. The RESID Database includes such information as: systematic and frequently observed alternate names; Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers; atomic formulas and weights; enzyme activities; indicators for N-terminal, C-terminal or peptide chain cross-link modifications; keywords; and literature citations with database cross-references. The RESID Database can be used to predict atomic masses for peptides, and is being enhanced to provide molecular structures for graphical presentation on the PIR Web site using widely available molecular viewing programs.
