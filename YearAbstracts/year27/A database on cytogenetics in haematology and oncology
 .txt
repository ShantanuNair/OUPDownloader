The aim of ‘Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology’ (http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/chromcancer) is to present summarized information on chromosome abnormalities in cancer, with extensions to genes involved in cancer and to cancer-prone diseases. Information is to be updated. This database is made for and by cytogeneticists, molecular biologists, clinicians in oncology and in haematology, and pathologists.
