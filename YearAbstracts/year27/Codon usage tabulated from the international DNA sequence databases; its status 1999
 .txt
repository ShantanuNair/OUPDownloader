Frequencies for each of the 206 526 complete protein-coding genes (CDS's) have been compiled from taxonomical divisions of the GenBank DNA sequence database. The sum of the codon use of 7434 organisms has also been calculated. These data files can be obtained from anonymous ftp sites of DDBJ, DISC and EBI. The list of the codon usage of genes in an organism as well as the sum of the codon usage of the organism was made searchable by the name of organism through a web site http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/~nakamura/CUTG.html
