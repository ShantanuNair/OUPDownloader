The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) focuses on the integration of mapping, homology, polymorphism and molecular data about the laboratory mouse. Detailed descriptions of genes including their chromosomal location, gene function, disease associations, mutant phenotypes, molecular polymorphisms and links to representative sequences including ESTs are integrated within MGD. The association of information from experiment to gene to genome requires careful coordination and implementation of standardized vocabularies, unique nomenclature constructions, and detailed information derived from multiple sources. This information is linked to other public databases that focus on additional information such as expression patterns, sequences, bibliographic details and large mapping panel data. Scientists participate in the curation of MGD data by generating the Chromosome Committee Reports, consulting on gene family nomenclature revisions, and providing descriptions of mouse strain characteristics and of new mutant phenotypes.
