EpoDB is a database of genes expressed in vertebrate red blood cells. It is also a prototype for the creation of cell and tissue-specific databases from multiple external sources. The information in EpoDB obtained from GenBank, SWISS-PROT, Transfac, TRRD and GERD is curated to provide high quality data for sequence analysis aimed at understanding gene regulation during erythropoiesis. New protocols have been developed for data integration and updating entries. Using a BLAST-based algorithm, we have grouped GenBank entries representing the same gene together. This sequence similarity protocol was also used to identify new entries to be included in EpoDB. We have recently implemented our database in Sybase (relational tables) in addition to SICStus Prolog to provide us with greater flexibility in asking complex queries that utilize information from multiple sources. New additions to the public web site (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/epodb) for accessing EpoDB are the ability to retrieve groups of entries representing different variants of the same gene and to retrieve gene expression data. The BLAST query has been enhanced by incorporating BLASTView, an interactive and graphical display of BLAST results. We have also enhanced the queries for retrieving sequence from specified genes by the addition of MEME, a motif discovery tool, to the integrated analysis tools which include CLUSTALW and TESS.
