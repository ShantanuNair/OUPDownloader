Swiss-2DPAGE (http://www.expasy.ch/ch2d/) is an annotated two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) database established in 1993. The current release contains 21 reference maps from human and mouse biological samples, as well as from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and Dictyostelium discoideum origin. These reference maps now have 2480 identified spots, corresponding to 528 separate protein entries in the database, in addition to virtual entries for each SWISS-PROT sequence. During the last year, the SWISS-2DPAGE has undergone major changes. Six new maps have been added, and new functions to access the data have been provided through the ExPASy server. Finally, an important change concerns the database funding source.
