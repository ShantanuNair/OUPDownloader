The Prostate Expression Database (PEDB) is a curated relational database and suite of analysis tools designed for the study of prostate gene expression in normal and disease states. Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and full-length cDNA sequences derived from more than 40 human prostate cDNA libraries are maintained and represent a wide spectrum of normal and pathological conditions. Detailed library information including tissue source, library construction methods, sequence diversity and abundance are available in a library archive. Prostate ESTs are assembled into distinct species groups using the multiple alignment program CAP2 and are annotated with information from the GenBank, dbEST and Unigene public sequence databases. Annotated sequences in PEDB are searched using the BLAST algorithm. The differential expression of each EST species can be viewed across all libraries using a Virtual Expression Analysis Tool (VEAT), a graphical user interface written in Java for intra- and inter-library species comparisons. PEDB may be accessed via the World Wide Web at http://www.mbt.washington.edu/PEDB/
