PhosphoBase contains information about phosphorylated residues in proteins and data about peptide phosphorylation by a variety of protein kinases. The data are collected from literature and compiled into a common format. The current release of PhosphoBase (October 1998, version 2.0) comprises 414 phosphoprotein entries covering 1052 phosphorylatable serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. The kinetic data from peptide phosphorylation assays for âˆ¼330 oligopeptides is also included. The database entries are cross-referenced to the corresponding records in the Swiss-Prot protein database and literature references are linked to MedLine records. PhosphoBase is available via the WWW at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/PhosphoBase/
