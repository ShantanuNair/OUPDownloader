A database of mutations in human eye disease genes has been constructed. This KMeyeDB employs a database software MutationView which provides graphical data presentation and analysis as a smooth user-interface. Currently, the KMeyeDB contains mutation data of 16 different genes for 18 eye diseases. The KMeyeDB is accessible through http://mutview.dmb.med.keio.ac.jp with advanced internet browsers.
