AAindex is a database of numerical indices representing various physicochemical and biochemical properties of amino acids and pairs of amino acids. It consists of two sections: AAindex1 for the amino acid index of 20 numerical values and AAindex2 for the amino acid mutation matrix of 210 numerical values. Each entry of either AAindex1 or AAindex2 consists of the definition, the reference information, a list of related entries in terms of the correlation coefficient, and the actual data. The database may be accessed through the DBGET/LinkDB system at GenomeNet (http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget/) or may be downloaded by anonymous FTP (ftp://ftp.genome.ad.jp/db/genomenet/aaindex/).
