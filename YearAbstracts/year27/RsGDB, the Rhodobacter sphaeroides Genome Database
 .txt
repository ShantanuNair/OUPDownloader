This report provides a summary of the sequencing project of the small chromosome (CII) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1T, and introduces the first version of the genome database of this bacterium. The database organizes and describes diverse sets of biological information. The main role of the R.sphaeroides genome database (RsGDB) is to provide public access to the collected genomic information for R.sphaeroides via the World-Wide Web at http://utmmg.med.uth.tmc.edu/sphaeroides. The database allows the user access to hundreds of low redundancy R.sphaeroides sequences for further database searching, a summary of our current search results, and other allied information pertaining to this bacterium.
