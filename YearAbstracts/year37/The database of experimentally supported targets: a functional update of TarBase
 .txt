TarBase5.0 is a database which houses a manually curated collection of experimentally supported microRNA (miRNA) targets in several animal species of central scientific interest, plants and viruses. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that exhibit an inhibitory effect on gene expression, interfering with the stability and translational efficiency of the targeted mature messenger RNAs. Even though several computational programs exist to predict miRNA targets, there is a need for a comprehensive collection and description of miRNA targets with experimental support. Here we introduce a substantially extended version of this resource. The current version includes more than 1300 experimentally supported targets. Each target site is described by the miRNA that binds it, the gene in which it occurs, the nature of the experiments that were conducted to test it, the sufficiency of the site to induce translational repression and/or cleavage, and the paper from which all these data were extracted. Additionally, the database is functionally linked to several other relevant and useful databases such as Ensembl, Hugo, UCSC and SwissProt.
