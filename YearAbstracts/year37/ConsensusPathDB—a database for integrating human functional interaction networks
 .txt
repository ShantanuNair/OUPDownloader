ConsensusPathDB is a database system for the integration of human functional interactions. Current knowledge of these interactions is dispersed in more than 200 databases, each having a specific focus and data format. ConsensusPathDB currently integrates the content of 12 different interaction databases with heterogeneous foci comprising a total of 26 133 distinct physical entities and 74 289 distinct functional interactions (proteinâ€“protein interactions, biochemical reactions, gene regulatory interactions), and covering 1738 pathways. We describe the database schema and the methods used for data integration. Furthermore, we describe the functionality of the ConsensusPathDB web interface, where users can search and visualize interaction networks, upload, modify and expand networks in BioPAX, SBML or PSI-MI format, or carry out over-representation analysis with uploaded identifier lists with respect to substructures derived from the integrated interaction network. The ConsensusPathDB database is available at: http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de
