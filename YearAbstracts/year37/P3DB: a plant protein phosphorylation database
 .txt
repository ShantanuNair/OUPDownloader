P3DB (http://www.p3db.org/) provides a resource of protein phosphorylation data from multiple plants. The database was initially constructed with a dataset from oilseed rape, including 14 670 nonredundant phosphorylation sites from 6382 substrate proteins, representing the largest collection of plant phosphorylation data to date. Additional protein phosphorylation data are being deposited into this database from large-scale studies of Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean. Phosphorylation data from current literature are also being integrated into the P3DB. With a web-based user interface, the database is browsable, downloadable and searchable by protein accession number, description and sequence. A BLAST utility was integrated and a phosphopeptide BLAST browser was implemented to allow users to query the database for phosphopeptides similar to protein sequences of their interest. With the large-scale phosphorylation data and associated web-based tools, P3DB will be a valuable resource for both plant and nonplant biologists in the field of protein phosphorylation.
