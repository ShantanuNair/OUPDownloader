PDBsum (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbsum) provides summary information about each experimentally determined structural model in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Here we describe some of its most recent features, including figures from the structure's key reference, citation data, Pfam domain diagrams, topology diagrams and protein–protein interactions. Furthermore, it now accepts users’ own PDB format files and generates a private set of analyses for each uploaded structure.
