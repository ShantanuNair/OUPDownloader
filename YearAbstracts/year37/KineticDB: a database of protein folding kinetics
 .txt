We propose here KineticDB, a systematically compiled database of protein folding kinetics, which contains about 90 unique proteins. The main goal of the KineticDB is to provide users with a diverse set of protein folding rates determined experimentally. The search for determinants of protein folding is still in progress, aimed at obtaining a new understanding of the folding process. Comparison with experimental protein folding rates has been the main tool for validation of both theoretical models and empirical relationships during the last 10 years. It is, therefore, necessary to provide a researcher with as much data as possible in a simple and easy-to-use way. At present, the KineticDB contains the results of folding kinetics measurements of single-domain proteins and separate protein domains as well as short peptides without disulfide bonds. It includes data on about 90 unique proteins and many mutants that have been systematically accumulated over the last 10 years and is the largest collection of protein folding kinetic data presented as a database. The KineticDB is available at http://kineticdb.protres.ru/db/index.pl.
