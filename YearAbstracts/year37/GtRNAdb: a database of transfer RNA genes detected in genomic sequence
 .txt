Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) represent the single largest, best-understood class of non-protein coding RNA genes found in all living organisms. By far, the major source of new tRNAs is computational identification of genes within newly sequenced genomes. To organize the rapidly growing collection and enable systematic analyses, we created the Genomic tRNA Database (GtRNAdb), currently including over 74 000 tRNA genes predicted from 740 species. The web resource provides overview statistics of tRNA genes within each analyzed genome, including information by isotype and genetic locus, easily downloadable primary sequences, graphical secondary structures and multiple sequence alignments. Direct links for each gene to UCSC eukaryotic and microbial genome browsers provide graphical display of tRNA genes in the context of all other local genetic information. The database can be searched by primary sequence similarity, tRNA characteristics or phylogenetic group. The database is publicly available at http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu.
