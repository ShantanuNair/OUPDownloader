Availability of a freely accessible, dynamic and integrated database for primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) is important both for researchers as well as clinicians. To build a PID informational platform and also as a part of action to initiate a network of PID research in Asia, we have constructed a web-based compendium of molecular alterations in PID, named Resource of Asian Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (RAPID), which is available as a worldwide web resource at http://rapid.rcai.riken.jp/. It hosts information on sequence variations and expression at the mRNA and protein levels of all genes reported to be involved in PID patients. The main objective of this database is to provide detailed information pertaining to genes and proteins involved in primary immunodeficiency diseases along with other relevant information about proteinâ€“protein interactions, mouse studies and microarray gene-expression profiles in various organs and cells of the immune system. RAPID also hosts a tool, mutation viewer, to predict deleterious and novel mutations and also to obtain mutation-based 3D structures for PID genes. Thus, information contained in this database should help physicians and other biomedical investigators to further investigate the role of these molecules in PID.
