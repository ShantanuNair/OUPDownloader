DNAReplication (at http://www.dnareplication.net) has been set up as a freely available single resource to facilitate access to information on eukaryotic DNA replication. This database summarizes organism-sorted data on replication proteins in the categories of nomenclature, biochemical properties, motifs, interactions, modifications, structure, cell localization and expression, and general comments. Replication concepts are defined and a general model of the steps in DNA replication is presented. Links to relevant websites and homepages of replication labs are provided. The site also has an interactive section where links to recent replication papers are posted and readers are provided with the facility to post comments about each paper. The interactive and links pages are modified weekly and the whole site is updated annually.
