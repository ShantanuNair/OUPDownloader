FLYSNPdb provides high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of Drosophila melanogaster. The database currently contains 27 367 polymorphisms, including >3700 indels (insertions/deletions), covering all major chromsomes. These SNPs are clustered into 2238 markers, which are evenly distributed with an average density of one marker every 50.3 kb or 6.6 genes. SNPs were identified automatically, filtered for high quality and partly manually curated. The database provides detailed information on the SNP data including molecular and cytological locations (genome Releases 3â€“5), alleles of up to five commonly used laboratory stocks, flanking sequences, SNP marker amplification primers, quality scores and genotyping assays. Data specific for a certain region, particular stocks or a certain genome assembly version are easily retrievable through the interface of a publicly accessible website (http://flysnp.imp.ac.at/flysnpdb.php).
