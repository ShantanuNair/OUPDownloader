The RNA Virus Database is a database and web application describing the genome organization and providing analytical tools for the 938 known species of RNA virus. It can identify submitted nucleotide sequences, can place them into multiple whole-genome alignments (in species where more than one isolate has been fully sequenced) and contains translated genome sequences for all species. It has been created for two main purposes: to facilitate the comparative analysis of RNA viruses and to become a hub for other, more specialised virus Web sites. It is available at the following four mirrored sites. http://virus.zoo.ox.ac.uk/rnavirusdbhttp://hivweb.sanbi.ac.za/rnavirusdbhttp://bioinf.cs.auckland.ac.nz/rnavirusdbhttp://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/rnavirusdb
