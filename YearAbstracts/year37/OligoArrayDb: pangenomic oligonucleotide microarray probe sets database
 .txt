OligoArrayDb is a comprehensive database containing pangenomic oligonucleotide microarray probe sets designed for most of the sequenced genomes that are not covered by commercial catalog arrays. The availability of probe sequences, associated with custom microarray fabrication services offered by many companies and cores presents the unequalled possibility to perform microarray experiments on most of the sequenced organisms. OligoArrayDb contains more than 2.8 probes per gene in average for more than 600 organisms, mostly archaea and bacteria strains available from public database. On average, 98% of the annotated genes have at least one probe which is predicted to be specific to its intended target in >94% of the cases. OligoArrayDb is weekly updated as new sequenced genomes become available. Probe sequences, in addition to a comprehensive set of annotations can be downloaded from this database. OligoArrayDb is publicly accessible online at http://berry.engin.umich.edu/oligoarraydb.
