The MAPU 2.0 database contains proteomes of organelles, tissues and cell types measured by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. In contrast to other databases it is meant to contain a limited number of experiments and only those with very high-resolution and -accuracy data. MAPU 2.0 displays the proteomes of organelles, tissues and body fluids or conversely displays the occurrence of proteins of interest in all these proteomes. The new release addresses MS-specific problems including ambiguous peptide-to-protein assignments and it provides insight into general functional features on the protein level ranging from gene ontology classification to comprehensive SwissProt annotation. Moreover, the derived proteomic data are used to annotate the genomes using Distributed Annotation Service (DAS) via EnsEMBL services. MAPU 2.0 is a model for a database specifically designed for high-accuracy proteomics and a member of the ProteomExchange Consortium. It is available on line at http://www.mapuproteome.com.
