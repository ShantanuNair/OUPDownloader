The BPS (http://bps.rutgers.edu) is a database of RNA base-pair structures, higher-order base interactions and isosteric pairs (base pairs with similar shape). The main functions of the BPS are to find and annotate the structural and chemical features of the Watson–Crick and non-Watson–Crick (noncanonical) base pairs in high-resolution RNA structures, and to provide a user-friendly interface to browse and search for the base pairs. The current database contains 91 265 bp and 3386 higher-order base interactions from 426 RNA crystal structures and 61 819 bp that fall into one of 17 different isosteric classes. The base-pair data can be accessed by searches of base-pair patterns, structure identifiers (IDs) and structural types. The BPS also includes an Atlas with representative images of the various base pairs, higher-order base interactions and isosteric pairs and links to statistical information about these groups of structures.
