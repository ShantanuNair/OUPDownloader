The vast accumulation of protein structural data has now facilitated the observation of many different complexes in the PDB for the same protein. Therefore, a single protein complex is not sufficient to identify their interaction sites, especially for proteins with multiple binding states or different partners, such as hub proteins. PiSite is a database that provides protein–protein interaction sites at the residue level with consideration of multiple complexes at the same time, by mapping the binding sites of all complexes containing the same protein in the PDB. PiSite provides easy web interfaces with an interactive viewer working with typical web browsers, and the different binding modes can be checked visually. All of the information can also be downloaded for further analyses. In addition, PiSite provides a list of proteins with multiple binding partners and multiple binding states, as well as up-to-date statistics of protein–protein interfaces. PiSite is available at http://pisite.hgc.jp
