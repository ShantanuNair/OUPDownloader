Living organisms change their proteome dramatically to sustain a stable internal milieu in fluctuating environments. To study the dynamics of proteins during stress, we measured the localization and abundance of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome under various growth conditions and genetic backgrounds using the GFP collection. We created a database (DB) called ‘LoQAtE’ (Localizaiton and Quantitation Atlas of the yeast proteomE), available online at http://www.weizmann.ac.il/molgen/loqate/, to provide easy access to these data. Using LoQAtE DB, users can get a profile of changes for proteins of interest as well as querying advanced intersections by either abundance changes, primary localization or localization shifts over the tested conditions. Currently, the DB hosts information on 5330 yeast proteins under three external perturbations (DTT, H2O2 and nitrogen starvation) and two genetic mutations [in the chaperonin containing TCP1 (CCT) complex and in the proteasome]. Additional conditions will be uploaded regularly. The data demonstrate hundreds of localization and abundance changes, many of which were not detected at the level of mRNA. LoQAtE is designed to allow easy navigation for non-experts in high-content microscopy and data are available for download. These data should open up new perspectives on the significant role of proteins while combating external and internal fluctuations.
