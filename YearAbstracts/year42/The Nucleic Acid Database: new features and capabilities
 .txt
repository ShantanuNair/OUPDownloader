The Nucleic Acid Database (NDB) (http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu) is a web portal providing access to information about 3D nucleic acid structures and their complexes. In addition to primary data, the NDB contains derived geometric data, classifications of structures and motifs, standards for describing nucleic acid features, as well as tools and software for the analysis of nucleic acids. A variety of search capabilities are available, as are many different types of reports. This article describes the recent redesign of the NDB Web site with special emphasis on new RNA-derived data and annotations and their implementation and integration into the search capabilities.
