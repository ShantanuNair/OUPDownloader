This manuscript describes an update of the leaf senescence database (LSD) previously featured in the 2011 NAR Database Issue. LSD provides comprehensive information concerning senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and their corresponding mutants. We have made extensive annotations for these SAGs through both manual and computational approaches. Recently, we updated LSD to a new version LSD 2.0 (http://www.eplantsenescence.org/), which contains 5356 genes and 322 mutants from 44 species, an extension from the previous version containing 1145 genes and 154 mutants from 21 species. In the current version, we also included several new features: (i) Primer sequences retrieved based on experimental evidence or designed for high-throughput analysis were added; (ii) More than 100 images of Arabidopsis SAG mutants were added; (iii) Arabidopsis seed information obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) was integrated; (iv) Subcellular localization information of SAGs in Arabidopsis mined from literature or generated from the SUBA3 program was presented; (v) Quantitative Trait Loci information was added with links to the original database and (vi) New options such as primer and miRNA search for database query were implemented. The updated database will be a valuable and informative resource for basic research of leaf senescence and for the manipulation of traits of agronomically important plants.
