The Human microRNA Disease Database (HMDD; available via the Web site at http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/hmdd and http://202.38.126.151/hmdd/tools/hmdd2.html) is a collection of experimentally supported human microRNA (miRNA) and disease associations. Here, we describe the HMDD v2.0 update that presented several novel options for users to facilitate exploration of the data in the database. In the updated database, miRNA–disease association data were annotated in more details. For example, miRNA–disease association data from genetics, epigenetics, circulating miRNAs and miRNA–target interactions were integrated into the database. In addition, HMDD v2.0 presented more data that were generated based on concepts derived from the miRNA–disease association data, including disease spectrum width of miRNAs and miRNA spectrum width of human diseases. Moreover, we provided users a link to download all the data in the HMDD v2.0 and a link to submit novel data into the database. Meanwhile, we also maintained the old version of HMDD. By keeping data sets up-to-date, HMDD should continue to serve as a valuable resource for investigating the roles of miRNAs in human disease.
