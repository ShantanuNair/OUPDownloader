NPInter (http://www.bioinfo.org/NPInter) is a database that integrates experimentally verified functional interactions between noncoding RNAs (excluding tRNAs and rRNAs) and other biomolecules (proteins, RNAs and genomic DNAs). Extensive studies on ncRNA interactions have shown that ncRNAs could act as part of enzymatic or structural complexes, gene regulators or other functional elements. With the development of high-throughput biotechnology, such as cross-linking immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), the number of known ncRNA interactions, especially those formed by protein binding, has grown rapidly in recent years. In this work, we updated NPInter to version 2.0 by collecting ncRNA interactions from recent literature and related databases, expanding the number of entries to 201 107 covering 18 species. In addition, NPInter v2.0 incorporated a service for the BLAST alignment search as well as visualization of interactions.
