Comparing, classifying and modelling protein structural interactions can enrich our understanding of many biomolecular processes. This contribution describes Kbdock (http://kbdock.loria.fr/), a database system that combines the Pfam domain classification with coordinate data from the PDB to analyse and model 3D domain–domain interactions (DDIs). Kbdock can be queried using Pfam domain identifiers, protein sequences or 3D protein structures. For a given query domain or pair of domains, Kbdock retrieves and displays a non-redundant list of homologous DDIs or domain–peptide interactions in a common coordinate frame. Kbdock may also be used to search for and visualize interactions involving different, but structurally similar, Pfam families. Thus, structural DDI templates may be proposed even when there is little or no sequence similarity to the query domains.
