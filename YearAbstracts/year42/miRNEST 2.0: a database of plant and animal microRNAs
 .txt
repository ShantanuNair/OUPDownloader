Ever growing interest in microRNAs has immensely populated the number of resources and research papers devoted to the field and, as a result, it becomes more and more demanding to find miRNA data of interest. To mitigate this problem, we created miRNEST database (http://mirnest.amu.edu.pl), an integrative microRNAs resource. In its updated version, named miRNEST 2.0, the database is complemented with our extensive miRNA predictions from deep sequencing libraries, data from plant degradome analyses, results of pre-miRNA classification with HuntMi and miRNA splice sites information. We also added download and upload options and improved the user interface to make it easier to browse through miRNA records.
