Polymorphisms in microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target sites (PolymiRTS) are known to disrupt miRNA function, leading to the development of disease and variation in physiological and behavioral phenotypes. Here, we describe recent updates to the PolymiRTS database (http://compbio.uthsc.edu/miRSNP), an integrated platform for analyzing the functional impact of genetic polymorphisms in miRNA seed regions and miRNA target sites. Recent advances in genomic technologies have made it possible to identify miRNA–mRNA binding sites from direct mapping experiments such as CLASH (cross linking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids). We have integrated data from CLASH experiments in the PolymiRTS database to provide more complete and accurate miRNA–mRNA interactions. Other significant new features include (i) small insertions and deletions in miRNA seed regions and miRNA target sites, (ii) TargetScan context + score differences for assessing the impact of polymorphic miRNA–mRNA interactions and (iii) biological pathways. The browse and search pages of PolymiRTS allow users to explore the relations between the PolymiRTSs and gene expression traits, physiological and behavioral phenotypes, human diseases and biological pathways.
