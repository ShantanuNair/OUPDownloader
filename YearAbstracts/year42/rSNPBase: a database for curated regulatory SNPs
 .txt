In recent years, human regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) have been widely studied. Here, we present database rSNPBase, freely available at http://rsnp.psych.ac.cn/, to provide curated rSNPs that analyses the regulatory features of all SNPs in the human genome with reference to experimentally supported regulatory elements. In contrast with previous SNP functional annotation databases, rSNPBase is characterized by several unique features. (i) To improve reliability, all SNPs in rSNPBase are annotated with reference to experimentally supported regulatory elements. (ii) rSNPBase focuses on rSNPs involved in a wide range of regulation types, including proximal and distal transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional regulation, and identifies their potentially regulated genes. (iii) Linkage disequilibrium (LD) correlations between SNPs were analysed so that the regulatory feature is annotated to SNP-set rather than a single SNP. (iv) rSNPBase provides the spatio-temporal labels and experimental eQTL labels for SNPs. In summary, rSNPBase provides more reliable, comprehensive and user-friendly regulatory annotations on rSNPs and will assist researchers in selecting candidate SNPs for further genetic studies and in exploring causal SNPs for in-depth molecular mechanisms of complex phenotypes.
