The database of 3D interacting domains (3did, available online for browsing and bulk download at http://3did.irbbarcelona.org) is a catalog of protein–protein interactions for which a high-resolution 3D structure is known. 3did collects and classifies all structural templates of domain–domain interactions in the Protein Data Bank, providing molecular details for such interactions. The current version also includes a pipeline for the discovery and annotation of novel domain–motif interactions. For every interaction, 3did identifies and groups different binding modes by clustering similar interfaces into ‘interaction topologies’. By maintaining a constantly updated collection of domain-based structural interaction templates, 3did is a reference source of information for the structural characterization of protein interaction networks. 3did is updated every 6 months.
