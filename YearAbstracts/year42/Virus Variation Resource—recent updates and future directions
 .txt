Virus Variation (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/VirusVariation/) is a comprehensive, web-based resource designed to support the retrieval and display of large virus sequence datasets. The resource includes a value added database, a specialized search interface and a suite of sequence data displays. Virus-specific sequence annotation and database loading pipelines produce consistent protein and gene annotation and capture sequence descriptors from sequence records then map these metadata to a controlled vocabulary. The database supports a metadata driven, web-based search interface where sequences can be selected using a variety of biological and clinical criteria. Retrieved sequences can then be downloaded in a variety of formats or analyzed using a suite of tools and displays. Over the past 2 years, the pre-existing influenza and Dengue virus resources have been combined into a single construct and West Nile virus added to the resultant resource. A number of improvements were incorporated into the sequence annotation and database loading pipelines, and the virus-specific search interfaces were updated to support more advanced functions. Several new features have also been added to the sequence download options, and a new multiple sequence alignment viewer has been incorporated into the resource tool set. Together these enhancements should support enhanced usability and the inclusion of new viruses in the future.
