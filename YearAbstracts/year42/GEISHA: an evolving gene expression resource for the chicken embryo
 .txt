GEISHA (Gallus Expression In Situ Hybridization Analysis; http://geisha.arizona.edu) is an in situ hybridization gene expression and genomic resource for the chicken embryo. This update describes modifications that enhance its utility to users. During the past 5 years, GEISHA has undertaken a significant restructuring to more closely conform to the data organization and formatting of Model Organism Databases in other species. This has involved migrating from an entry-centric format to one that is gene-centered. Database restructuring has enabled the inclusion of data pertaining to chicken genes and proteins and their orthologs in other species. This new information is presented through an updated user interface. In situ hybridization data in mouse, frog, zebrafish and fruitfly are integrated with chicken genomic and expression information. A resource has also been developed that integrates the GEISHA interface information with the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man human disease gene database. Finally, the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Committee database and the GEISHA database have been integrated so that they draw from the same data resources.
