The Candida Genome Database (CGD, http://www.candidagenome.org/) is a freely available online resource that provides gene, protein and sequence information for multiple Candida species, along with web-based tools for accessing, analyzing and exploring these data. The goal of CGD is to facilitate and accelerate research into Candida pathogenesis and biology. The CGD Web site is organized around Locus pages, which display information collected about individual genes. Locus pages have multiple tabs for accessing different types of information; the default Summary tab provides an overview of the gene name, aliases, phenotype and Gene Ontology curation, whereas other tabs display more in-depth information, including protein product details for coding genes, notes on changes to the sequence or structure of the gene and a comprehensive reference list. Here, in this update to previous NAR Database articles featuring CGD, we describe a new tab that we have added to the Locus page, entitled the Homology Information tab, which displays phylogeny and gene similarity information for each locus.
