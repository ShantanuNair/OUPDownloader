Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are gaining importance as anti-infective agents. Here we describe the updated Collection of Antimicrobial Peptide (CAMP) database, available online at http://www.camp.bicnirrh.res.in/. The 3D structures of peptides are known to influence antimicrobial activity. Although there exists databases of AMPs, information on structures of AMPs is limited in these databases. CAMP is manually curated and currently holds 6756 sequences and 682 3D structures of AMPs. Sequence and structure analysis tools have been incorporated to enhance the usefulness of the database.
