IMG/M (http://img.jgi.doe.gov/m) provides support for comparative analysis of microbial community aggregate genomes (metagenomes) in the context of a comprehensive set of reference genomes from all three domains of life, as well as plasmids, viruses and genome fragments. IMG/M’s data content and analytical tools have expanded continuously since its first version was released in 2007. Since the last report published in the 2012 NAR Database Issue, IMG/M’s database architecture, annotation and data integration pipelines and analysis tools have been extended to copewith the rapid growth in the number and size of metagenome data sets handled by the system. IMG/M data marts provide support for the analysis of publicly available genomes, expert review of metagenome annotations (IMG/M ER: http://img.jgi.doe.gov/mer) and Human Microbiome Project (HMP)-specific metagenome samples (IMG/M HMP: http://img.jgi.doe.gov/imgm_hmp).
