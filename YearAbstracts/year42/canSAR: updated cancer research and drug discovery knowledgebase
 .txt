canSAR (http://cansar.icr.ac.uk) is a public integrative cancer-focused knowledgebase for the support of cancer translational research and drug discovery. Through the integration of biological, pharmacological, chemical, structural biology and protein network data, it provides a single information portal to answer complex multidisciplinary questions including—among many others—what is known about a protein, in which cancers is it expressed or mutated, and what chemical tools and cell line models can be used to experimentally probe its activity? What is known about a drug, its cellular sensitivity profile and what proteins is it known to bind that may explain unusual bioactivity? Here we describe major enhancements to canSAR including new data, improved search and browsing capabilities and new target, cancer cell line, protein family and 3D structure summaries and tools.
