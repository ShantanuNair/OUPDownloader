Molecular Biology has been at the heart of the ‘big data’ revolution from its very beginning, and the need for access to biological data is a common thread running from the 1965 publication of Dayhoff’s ‘Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure’ through the Human Genome Project in the late 1990s and early 2000s to today’s population-scale sequencing initiatives. The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI; http://www.ebi.ac.uk) is one of three organizations worldwide that provides free access to comprehensive, integrated molecular data sets. Here, we summarize the principles underpinning the development of these public resources and provide an overview of EMBL-EBI’s database collection to complement the reviews of individual databases provided elsewhere in this issue.
