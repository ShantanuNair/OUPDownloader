The dbPSHP database (http://jjwanglab.org/dbpshp) aims to help researchers to efficiently identify, validate and visualize putative positively selected loci in human evolution and further discover the mechanism governing these natural selections. Recent evolution of human populations at the genomic level reflects the adaptations to the living environments, including climate change and availability and stability of nutrients. Many genetic regions under positive selection have been identified, which assist us to understand how natural selection has shaped population differences. Here, we manually collect recent positive selections in different human populations, consisting of 15 472 loci from 132 publications. We further compiled a database that used 15 statistical terms of different evolutionary attributes for single nucleotide variant sites from the HapMap 3 and 1000 Genomes Project to identify putative regions under positive selection. These attributes include variant allele/genotype properties, variant heterozygosity, within population diversity, long-range haplotypes, pairwise population differentiation and evolutionary conservation. We also provide interactive pages for visualization and annotation of different selective signals. The database is freely available to the public and will be frequently updated.
