Ribosomal 5S RNA (5S rRNA) is an integral component of the large ribosomal subunit in all known organisms with the exception only of mitochondrial ribosomes of fungi and animals. It is thought to enhance protein synthesis by stabilization of a ribosome structure. This paper presents the updated database of 5S rRNA and their genes (5S rDNA). Its short characteristics are presented in the Introduction. The database contains 2280 primary structures of 5S rRNA and 5S rRNA genes. These include 536 eubacterial, 61 archaebacterial, 1611 eukaryotic and 72 organelle sequences. The database is available on line through the World Wide Web at http://biobases.ibch.poznan.pl/5SData/.
