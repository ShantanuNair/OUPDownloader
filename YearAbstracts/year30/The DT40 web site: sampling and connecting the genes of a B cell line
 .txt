Thousands of new vertebrate genes have been discovered and genetic systems are needed to address their functions at the cellular level. The chicken B cell line DT40 allows efficient gene disruptions due to its high homologous recombination activity. However, cloning the gene of interest is often cumbersome, since relatively few chicken cDNA sequences are present in the public databases. In addition, the accumulation of multiple mutations within the same cell clone is limited by the consumption of one drug-resistance marker for each transfection. Here, we present the DT40 web site (http://genetics.hpi.uni-hamburg.de/dt40.html), which includes a comprehensive database of chicken bursal ESTs to identify disruption candidate genes and recyclable marker cassettes based on the loxP system. These freely available resources greatly facilitate the analysis of genes and genetic networks.
