yMGV (yeast Microarray Global Viewer) was designed to provide biologists with meaningful information from genome-wide yeast expression data. The database includes most of the available expression data published on yeast microarrays over the last 4 years. It provides customizable tools for the rapid visualization of expression profiles associated with a set of genes from all published experiments. It also allows users to compare the results from different publications so that they can identify genes with common expression profiles. We used yMGV to perform global analyses to find a gene expression profile specific for given biological conditions and to locate functional gene clusters on chromosomes. Other organisms will be added to this database. yMGV is accessible on the web at http://transcriptome.ens.fr/ymgv.
