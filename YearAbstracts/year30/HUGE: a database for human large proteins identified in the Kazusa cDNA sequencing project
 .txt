We have been developing a HUGE database to summarize results from the sequence analysis of human novel large (>4 kb) cDNAs identified in the Kazusa cDNA sequencing project, systematically designated KIAA plus a four-digit number. HUGE currently contains nearly 2000 gene/protein characteristic tables harboring the results of the computer-assisted analysis of the cDNA and the predicted protein sequences together with those of expression profiling and chromosomal mapping. In the updated version of HUGE, we made it possible to compare each KIAA cDNA sequence with the corresponding entry in the human draft genome sequence that was published recently. Approximately 90% of KIAA cDNAs in HUGE can be localized along the human genome for at least half or more of the cDNAâ€™s length. Any nucleotide differences between the cDNA and the corresponding genomic sequences are also presented in detail. This new version of HUGE greatly helps us evaluate the completeness of cDNA clones and the accuracy of cDNA/genomic sequences. More interestingly, in some cases, the ability to compare cDNA with genomic sequences allows us to identify candidate sites of RNA editing. HUGE is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/huge.
