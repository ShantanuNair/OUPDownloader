Angiogenesis is the formation of new capillaries sprouting from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenesis occurs in a variety of normal physiological and pathological conditions and is regulated by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory angiogenic factors. The control of this balance may fail and result in the formation of a pathologic capillary network during the development of many diseases. Therefore, we developed the angiogenesis database (AngioDB), which can provide a signaling network of angiogenesis-related biomolecules in human. Each record of AngioDB consisted of 12 fields and was developed by using a relational database management system. For the retrieval of data, Active Server Page (ASP) technology was integrated in this system. Users can access the database by a query or imagemap browsing program. The retrieving system also provides a list of angiogenesis-related molecules classified by three categories, and the database has an external link to NCBI databases. AngioDB is available via the Internet at http://angiodb.snu.ac.kr/.
