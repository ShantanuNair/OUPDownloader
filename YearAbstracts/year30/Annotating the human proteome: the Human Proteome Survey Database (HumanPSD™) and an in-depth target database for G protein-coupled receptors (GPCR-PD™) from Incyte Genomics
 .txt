The Proteome Division of Incyte Genomics has released new volumes to the BioKnowledge® Library to add human, mouse and rat protein information to its rich collection of model organism Proteome Databases. The Human Proteome Survey Database (HumanPSD™) compiles the fundamental properties of more than 25 000 characterized mammalian proteins. HumanPSD™ includes clear, concise and current protein descriptions (Title Lines), the protein sequence, calculated physical properties, precomputed BLAST alignments, controlled-vocabulary protein properties and Gene Ontology™ terms, and a list of published references. Each report also contains expression data, Pfam domain information and an associated Mouse Mutant Phenotype section describing behavioral, physiological and cellular phenotypes for over 1500 mouse mutant phenotypes. GPCR-PD™ contains more than 3200 Protein Reports from the three mammalian species for G protein-coupled receptors, their protein ligands, associated G-proteins and their downstream signaling proteins. In addition to the features described above, each GPCR-PD Protein Report displays annotations of experimental findings from over 10 000 publications. These databases provide important new volumes of Proteome’s BioKnowledge Library (http://www.incyte.com), integrating protein information from model organisms with the human proteome.
