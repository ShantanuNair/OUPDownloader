High-density oligonucleotide arrays are a powerful tool for uncovering changes in global gene expression in various disease states. To this end, it is essential to first characterize the variations of gene expression in normal physiological processes. We established the Human Gene Expression (HuGE) Index database (www.HugeIndex.org) to serve as a public repository for gene expression data on normal human tissues using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. This resource currently contains the results of 59 gene expression experiments on 19 human tissues. We provide interactive tools for researchers to query and visualize our data over the Internet. To facilitate data analysis, we cross-reference each gene on the array with its annotation in the LocusLink database at NCBI.
