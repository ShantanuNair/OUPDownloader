PLANT-PIs is a database developed to facilitate retrieval of information on plant protease inhibitors (PIs) and related genes. For each PI, links to sequence databases are reported together with a summary of the functional properties of the molecule (and its mutants) as deduced from literature. PLANT-PIs contains information for 351 plant PIs, plus several isoinhibitors. The database is accessible at http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/PLANT-PIs.
