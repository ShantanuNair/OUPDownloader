FUGOID is a web-based, taxonomically broad organelle intron database that collects and integrates various functional and structural data on organellar (mitochondrial and chloroplast) introns. The main information provided by FUGOID includes intron sequence, subclass, resident ORF, self-splicing capability, host gene, protein factor(s) involved in splicing, mobility, insertion site, twintron, seminal references and taxonomic position of host organism. It is implemented in a relational database management system, allowing sophisticated, user-friendly searching, data entry and revision. Users can access the database by any common web browser using a variety of operating systems. The main page of the database is available at http://wnt.cc.utexas.edu/~ifmr530/introndata/main.htm.
