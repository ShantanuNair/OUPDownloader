Since the advent of the draft human genome sequence there has been growing interest in transcriptome analysis based on genomic data. The Gene Resource Locator (GRL) assembles gene maps that include information on gene-expression patterns, cis-elements in regulatory regions and alternatively spliced transcripts. The database was constructed using customized software, and currently contains 2.2 million alignments (exonâ€“intron structures). The alignments have been annotated and integrated into a system that encompasses approximately 90 000 EST loci sharing common exons, 8091 alternatively spliced transcript groups, 10 801 expression-profile groups, 8066 candidate regulatory regions in full-length cDNAs, and 1 million SNP loci. We have used Flash technology to build a dynamic web viewer that facilitates browsing through the millions of alignments. All of the information is available through the World Wide Web at the Gene Resource Locator web site (http://grl.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp).
