CSDBase (http://www.chemie.uni-marburg.de/~csdbase/) is an interactive Internet-embedded research platform providing detailed information on proteins containing the cold shock domain (CSD). It consists of two separated database cores, one dedicated to CSD protein information, and one to provide a powerful resource to relevant literature with emphasis on the bacterial cold shock response. In addition to detailed protein information and useful cross links to other web sites, CSDBase contains computer-generated CSD structure models for most CSD-containing protein sequences available at NCBI non-redundant protein database at the time of CSDBase establishment. These models were calculated on the basis of known crystal and/or NMR structures using SWISS-MODEL and can be downloaded as PDB structure coordinate files for viewing and for manipulation with other software tools. CSDBase will be regularly updated and is organized in a compact form providing user friendly interfaces to both database cores which allow for easy data retrieval.
