Although many human genes have been associated with genetic diseases, knowing which mutations result in disease phenotypes often does not explain the etiology of a specific disease. Drosophilamelanogaster provides a powerful system in which to use genetic and molecular approaches to investigate human genetic diseases. Homophila is an intergenomic resource linking the human and fly genomes in order to stimulate functional genomic investigations in Drosophila that address questions about genetic disease in humans. Homophila provides a comprehensive linkage between the disease genes compiled in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and the complete Drosophila genomic sequence. Homophila is a relational database that allows searching based on human disease descriptions, OMIM number, human or fly gene names, and sequence similarity, and can be accessed at http://homophila.sdsc.edu.
