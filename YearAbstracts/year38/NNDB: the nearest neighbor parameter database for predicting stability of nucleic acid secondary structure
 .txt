The Nearest Neighbor Database (NNDB, http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/NNDB) is a web-based resource for disseminating parameter sets for predicting nucleic acid secondary structure stabilities. For each set of parameters, the database includes the set of rules with descriptive text, sequence-dependent parameters in plain text and html, literature references to experiments and usage tutorials. The initial release covers parameters for predicting RNA folding free energy and enthalpy changes.
