PDBselect (http://bioinfo.tg.fh-giessen.de/pdbselect/) is a list of representative protein chains with low mutual sequence identity selected from the protein data bank (PDB) to enable unbiased statistics. The list increased from 155 chains in 1992 to more than 4500 chains in 2009. PDBfilter-select is an online service to generate user-defined selections.
