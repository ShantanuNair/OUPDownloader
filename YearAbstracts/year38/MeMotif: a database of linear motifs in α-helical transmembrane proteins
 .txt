Membrane proteins are important for many processes in the cell and used as main drug targets. The increasing number of high-resolution structures available makes for the first time a characterization of local structural and functional motifs in α-helical transmembrane proteins possible. MeMotif (http://projects.biotec.tu-dresden.de/memotif) is a database and wiki which collects more than 2000 known and novel computationally predicted linear motifs in α-helical transmembrane proteins. Motifs are fully described in terms of several structural and functional features and editable. Motifs contained in MeMotif can be used in different biological applications, from the identification of biochemically important functional residues which are candidates for mutagenesis experiments to the improvement of tools for transmembrane protein modeling.
