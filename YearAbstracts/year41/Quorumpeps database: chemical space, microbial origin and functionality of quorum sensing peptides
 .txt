Quorum-sensing (QS) peptides are biologically attractive molecules, with a wide diversity of structures and prone to modifications altering or presenting new functionalities. Therefore, the Quorumpeps database (http://quorumpeps.ugent.be) is developed to give a structured overview of the QS oligopeptides, describing their microbial origin (species), functionality (method, result and receptor), peptide links and chemical characteristics (3D-structure-derived physicochemical properties). The chemical diversity observed within this group of QS signalling molecules can be used to develop new synthetic bio-active compounds.
