Whole-genome sequencing of cancers has begun to identify thousands of somatic mutations that distinguish the genomes of normal tissues from cancers. While many germline mutations within microRNAs (miRNAs) and their targets have been shown to alter miRNA function in cancers and have been associated with cancer risk, the impact of somatic mutations on miRNA function has received relatively little attention. Here, we have created the SomamiR database (http://compbio.uthsc.edu/SomamiR/) to provide a comprehensive resource that integrates several types of data for use in investigating the impact of somatic and germline mutations on miRNA function in cancer. The database contains somatic mutations that may create or disrupt miRNA target sites and integrates these somatic mutations with germline mutations within the same target sites, genome-wide and candidate gene association studies of cancer and functional annotations that link genes containing mutations with cancer. Additionally, the database contains a collection of germline and somatic mutations in miRNAs and their targets that have been experimentally shown to impact miRNA function and have been associated with cancer.
