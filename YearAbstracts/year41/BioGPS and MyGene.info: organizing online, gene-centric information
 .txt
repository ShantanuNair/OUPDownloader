Fast-evolving technologies have enabled researchers to easily generate data at genome scale, and using these technologies to compare biological states typically results in a list of candidate genes. Researchers are then faced with the daunting task of prioritizing these candidate genes for follow-up studies. There are hundreds, possibly even thousands, of web-based gene annotation resources available, but it quickly becomes impractical to manually access and review all of these sites for each gene in a candidate gene list. BioGPS (http://biogps.org) was created as a centralized gene portal for aggregating distributed gene annotation resources, emphasizing community extensibility and user customizability. BioGPS serves as a convenient tool for users to access known gene-centric resources, as well as a mechanism to discover new resources that were previously unknown to the user. This article describes updates to BioGPS made after its initial release in 2008. We summarize recent additions of features and data, as well as the robust user activity that underlies this community intelligence application. Finally, we describe MyGene.info (http://mygene.info) and related web services that provide programmatic access to BioGPS.
