The metaMicrobesOnline database (freely available at http://meta.MicrobesOnline.org) offers phylogenetic analysis of genes from microbial genomes and metagenomes. Gene trees are constructed for canonical gene families such as COG and Pfam. Such gene trees allow for rapid homologue analysis and subfamily comparison of genes from multiple metagenomes and comparisons with genes from microbial isolates. Additionally, the genome browser permits genome context comparisons, which may be used to determine the closest sequenced genome or suggest functionally associated genes. Lastly, the domain browser permits rapid comparison of protein domain organization within genes of interest from metagenomes and complete microbial genomes.
