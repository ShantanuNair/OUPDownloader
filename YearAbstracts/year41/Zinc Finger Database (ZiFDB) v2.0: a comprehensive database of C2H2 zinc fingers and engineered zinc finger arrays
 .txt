ZiFDB (Zinc Finger Database, http://zifdb.msi.umn.edu) is a web-accessible database that houses information on individual C2H2 zinc fingers (ZFs) and engineered zinc finger arrays (ZFAs). ZiFDB serves as a resource for biologists interested in engineering ZFAs for use as sequence-specific DNA-binding reagents. Here, we describe four new features of ZiFDB: (i) the database allows users to input new ZFs and ZFAs; (ii) a shadow database temporarily stores user-submitted data, pending approval by the database curator and subsequent loading into the persistent database; (iii) ZiFDB contains 181 Context-Dependent Assembly (CoDA) ZFAs, which were generated by this newly described ZFA engineering platform; and (iv) the database also now contains 319 F1F2 CoDA units and 334 F2F3 CoDA units that can be used to construct CoDA arrays. In total, the new release of ZiFDB contains 1226 ZFs and 1123 ZFAs.
