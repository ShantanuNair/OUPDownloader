ClusterMine360 (http://www.clustermine360.ca/) is a database of microbial polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide gene clusters. It takes advantage of crowd-sourcing by allowing members of the community to make contributions while automation is used to help achieve high data consistency and quality. The database currently has >200 gene clusters from >185 compound families. It also features a unique sequence repository containing >10 000 polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase domains. The sequences are filterable and downloadable as individual or multiple sequence FASTA files. We are confident that this database will be a useful resource for members of the polyketide synthases/non-ribosomal peptide synthetases research community, enabling them to keep up with the growing number of sequenced gene clusters and rapidly mine these clusters for functional information.
