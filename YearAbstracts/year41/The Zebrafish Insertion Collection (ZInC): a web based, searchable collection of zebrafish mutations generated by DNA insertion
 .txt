ZInC (Zebrafish Insertional Collection, http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/ZInC/) is a web-searchable interface of insertional mutants in zebrafish. Over the last two decades, the zebrafish has become a popular model organism for studying vertebrate development as well as for modeling human diseases. To facilitate such studies, we are generating a genome-wide knockout resource that targets every zebrafish protein-coding gene. All mutant fish are freely available to the scientific community through the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC). To assist researchers in finding mutant and insertion information, we developed a comprehensive database with a web front-end, the ZInC. It can be queried using multiple types of input such as ZFIN (Zebrafish Information Network) IDs, UniGene accession numbers and gene symbols from zebrafish, human and mouse. In the future, ZInC may include data from other insertional mutation projects as well. ZInC cross-references all integration data with the ZFIN (http://zfin.org/).
