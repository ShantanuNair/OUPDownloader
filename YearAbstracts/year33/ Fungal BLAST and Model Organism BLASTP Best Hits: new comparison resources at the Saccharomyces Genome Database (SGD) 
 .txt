 The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; http://www.yeastgenome.org/ ) is a scientific database of gene, protein and genomic information for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . SGD has recently developed two new resources that facilitate nucleotide and protein sequence comparisons between S.cerevisiae and other organisms. The Fungal BLAST tool provides directed searches against all fungal nucleotide and protein sequences available from GenBank, divided into categories according to organism, status of completeness and annotation, and source. The Model Organism BLASTP Best Hits resource displays, for each S.cerevisiae protein, the single most similar protein from several model organisms and presents links to the database pages of those proteins, facilitating access to curated information about potential orthologs of yeast proteins.
