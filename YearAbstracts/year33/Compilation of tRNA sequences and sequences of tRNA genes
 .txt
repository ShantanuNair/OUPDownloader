 Maintained at the Universit√§t Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany, the Compilation of tRNA Sequences and Sequences of tRNA Genes is accessible at the URL http://www.tRNA.uni-bayreuth.de with mirror site located at the Institute of Protein Research, Pushchino, Russia ( http://alpha.protres.ru/trnadbase ). The compilation is a searchable, periodically updated database of currently available tRNA sequences. The present version of the database contains a new Genomic tRNA Compilation including the sequences of tRNA genes from genomic sequences published up to July 2003. It consists of about 5800 tRNA gene sequences from 111 organisms covering archaea, bacteria, higher and lower eukarya. The former Compilation of tRNA Genes (up to the end of 1998) and the updated Compilation tRNA Sequences (561 entries) are also supported by the new software. The database can be explored by using multiple search criteria and sequence templates. The database provides a service that allows to obtain statistical information on the occurrences of certain bases at given positions of the tRNA sequences. This allows phylogenic studies and search for identity elements in respect to interactions of tRNAs with various enzymes.
