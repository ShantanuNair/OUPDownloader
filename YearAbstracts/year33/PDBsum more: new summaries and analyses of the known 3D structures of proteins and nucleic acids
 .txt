 PDBsum is a database of mainly pictorial summaries of the 3D structures of proteins and nucleic acids in the Protein Data Bank. Its pages aim to provide an at-a-glance view of the contents of every 3D structure, plus detailed structural analyses of each protein chain, DNAâ€“RNA chain and any bound ligands and metals. In the past year, the database has been significantly improved, in terms of both appearance and new content. Moreover, it has moved to its new address at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/pdbsum .
