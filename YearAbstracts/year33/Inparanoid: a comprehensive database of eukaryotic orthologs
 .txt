 The Inparanoid eukaryotic ortholog database ( http://inparanoid.cgb.ki.se/ ) is a collection of pairwise ortholog groups between 17 whole genomes; Anopheles gambiae , Caenorhabditis briggsae , Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila melanogaster , Danio rerio , Takifugu rubripes , Gallus gallus , Homo sapiens , Mus musculus , Pan troglodytes , Rattus norvegicus , Oryza sativa , Plasmodium falciparum , Arabidopsis thaliana , Escherichia coli , Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Complete proteomes for these genomes were derived from Ensembl and UniProt and compared pairwise using Blast, followed by a clustering step using the Inparanoid program. An Inparanoid cluster is seeded by a reciprocally best-matching ortholog pair, around which inparalogs (should they exist) are gathered independently, while outparalogs are excluded. The ortholog clusters can be searched on the website using Ensembl gene/protein or UniProt identifiers, annotation text or by Blast alignment against our protein datasets. The entire dataset can be downloaded, as can the Inparanoid program itself.
