 REBASE is a comprehensive database of information about restriction enzymes, DNA methyltransferases and related proteins involved in restriction–modification. It contains both published and unpublished work with information about recognition and cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, crystal and sequence data. Experimentally characterized homing endonucleases are also included. Additionally, REBASE contains complete and up-to-date information about the methylation sensitivity of restriction endonucleases. An extensive analysis is included of the restriction–modification systems that are predicted to be present in the sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes from GenBank. The contents of REBASE are available by browsing from the web ( http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html ) and through selected compilations by ftp ( ftp.neb.com ) and as monthly updates that can be requested via email.
