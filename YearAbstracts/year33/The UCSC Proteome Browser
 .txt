 The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Proteome Browser provides a wealth of protein information presented in graphical images and with links to other protein-related Internet sites. The Proteome Browser is tightly integrated with the UCSC Genome Browser. For the first time, Genome Browser users have both the genome and proteome worlds at their fingertips simultaneously. The Proteome Browser displays tracks of protein and genomic sequences, exon structure, polarity, hydrophobicity, locations of cysteine and glycosylation potential, Superfamily domains and amino acids that deviate from normal abundance. Histograms show genome-wide distribution of protein properties, including isoelectric point, molecular weight, number of exons, InterPro domains and cysteine locations, together with specific property values of the selected protein. The Proteome Browser also provides links to gene annotations in the Genome Browser, the Known Genes details page and the Gene Sorter; domain information from Superfamily, InterPro and Pfam; three-dimensional structures at the Protein Data Bank and ModBase; and pathway data at KEGG, BioCarta/CGAP and BioCyc. As of August 2004, the Proteome Browser is available for human, mouse and rat proteomes. The browser may be accessed from any Known Genes details page of the Genome Browser at http://genome.ucsc.edu . A user's guide is also available on this website.
