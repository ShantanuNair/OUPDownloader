 SBASE ( http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/sbase ) is an online resource designed to facilitate the detection of domain homologies based on sequence database search. The present release of the SBASE A library of protein domain sequences contains 972 397 protein sequence segments annotated by structure, function, ligand-binding or cellular topology, clustered into 8547 domain groups. SBASE B contains 169 916 domain sequences clustered into 2526 less well-characterized groups. Domain prediction is based on an evaluation of database search results in comparison with a ‘similarity network’ of inter-sequence similarity scores, using support vector machines trained on similarity search results of known domains.
