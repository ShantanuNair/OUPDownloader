 Ciliated protozoa have two kinds of nuclei: Macronuclei (MAC) and Micronuclei (MIC). In some ciliate classes, such as spirotrichs, most genes undergo several layers of DNA rearrangement during macronuclear development. Because of such processes, these organisms provide ideal systems for studying mechanisms of recombination and gene rearrangement. Here, we describe a database that contains all spirotrich genes for which both MAC and MIC versions are sequenced, with consistent annotation and easy access to all the features. An interface to query the database is available at http://oxytricha.princeton.edu/dimorphism/database.htm .
