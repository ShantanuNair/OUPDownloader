The European Large Subunit Ribosomal RNA Database compiles all complete or nearly complete large subunit ribosomal RNA sequences available from public sequence databases. These are provided in aligned format and the secondary structure, as derived by comparative sequence analysis, is included. Additional information about the sequences such as literature references and taxonomic information is also included. The database is available from our WWW server at http://rrna.uia.ac.be/lsu/.
