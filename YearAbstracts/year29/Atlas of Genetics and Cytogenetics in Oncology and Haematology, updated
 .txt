The ‘Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology’ (http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/chromcancer) is an Internet database aimed at genes involved in cancer, cytogenetics and clinical entities in cancer, and cancer-prone diseases. It presents information in concise and updated reviews (cards) or longer texts (deep insights), a (new) case report section, a huge portal towards genetics and/or cancer databases, and teaching items in genetics for students in medicine and the sciences. This database is made for and by clinicians and researchers in the above-mentioned fields, who are encouraged to contribute. It deals with cancer research, genomics and cytogenomics. It is at the crossroads of research, post-university teaching and telemedicine. The Atlas is available at no cost.
