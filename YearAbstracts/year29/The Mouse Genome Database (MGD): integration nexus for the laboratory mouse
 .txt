The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) is the community database resource for the laboratory mouse, a key model organism for interpreting the human genome and for understanding human biology and disease (http://www.informatics.jax.org). MGD provides standard nomenclature and consensus map positions for mouse genes and genetic markers; it provides a curated set of mammalian homology records, user-defined chromosomal maps, experimental data sets and the definitive mouse ‘gene to sequence’ reference set for the research community. The integration and standardization of these data sets facilitates the transition between mouse DNA sequence, gene and phenotype annotations. A recent focus on allele and phenotype representations enhances the ability of MGD to organize and present data for exploring the relationship between genotype and phenotype. This link between the genome and the biology of the mouse is especially important as phenotype information grows from large mutagenesis projects and genotype information grows from large-scale sequencing projects.
