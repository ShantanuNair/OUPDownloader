The RESID Database is a comprehensive collection of annotations and structures for protein post-translational modifications including N-terminal, C-terminal and peptide chain cross-link modifications. The RESID Database includes systematic and frequently observed alternate names, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers, atomic formulas and weights, enzyme activities, taxonomic range, keywords, literature citations with database cross-references, structural diagrams and molecular models. The NRL-3D Sequence–Structure Database is derived from the three-dimensional structure of proteins deposited with the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank. The NRL-3D Database includes standardized and frequently observed alternate names, sources, keywords, literature citations, experimental conditions and searchable sequences from model coordinates. These databases are freely accessible through the National Cancer Institute–Frederick Advanced Biomedical Computing Center at these web sites: http://www.ncifcrf.gov/RESID, http://www.ncifcrf.gov/NRL-3D ; or at these National Biomedical Research Foundation Protein Information Resource web sites: http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/resid.html, http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/nrl3d.html
