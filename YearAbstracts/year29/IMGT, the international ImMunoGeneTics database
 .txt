IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics database, freely available at http://imgt.cines.fr:8104, was created in 1989 at the Université Montpellier II, CNRS, Mont­pellier, France, and is a high quality integrated information system specialising in immunoglobulins, T cell receptors and major histocompatibility complex molecules of human and other vertebrates. IMGT provides researchers and clinicians with a common access to all nucleotide, protein, genetic and structural immunogenetics data. This information is of high value for medical and veterinary research, biotechnology related to antibody and T cell receptor engineering, genome diversity and evolution studies of the immune response.
