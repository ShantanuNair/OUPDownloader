PDB-REPRDB is a database of representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The previous version of PDB-REPRDB provided 48 representative sets, whose similarity criteria were predetermined, on the WWW. The current version is designed so that the user may obtain a quick selection of representative chains from PDB. The selection of representative chains can be dynamically configured according to the userâ€™s requirement. The WWW interface provides a large degree of freedom in setting parameters, such as cut-off scores of sequence and structural similarity. One can obtain a representative list and classification data of protein chains from the system. The current database includes 20 457 protein chains from PDB entries (August 6, 2000). The system for PDB-REPRDB is available at the Parallel Protein Information Analysis system (PAPIA) WWW server (http://www.rwcp.or.jp/papia/).
