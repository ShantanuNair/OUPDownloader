PDBsum is a web-based database providing a largely pictorial summary of the key information on each macromolecular structure deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It includes images of the structure, annotated plots of each protein chain’s secondary structure, detailed structural analyses generated by the PROMOTIF program, summary PROCHECK results and schematic diagrams of protein–ligand and protein–DNA interactions. RasMol scripts highlight key aspects of the structure, such as the protein’s domains, PROSITE patterns and protein–ligand interactions, for interactive viewing in 3D. Numerous links take the user to related sites. PDBsum is updated whenever any new structures are released by the PDB and is freely accessible via http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/pdbsum.
