Since July 1995, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) has maintained RHdb (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/RHdb), a public database for radiation hybrid data. Radiation hybrid mapping is an important technique for determining high resolution maps. RHdb is also served by CORBA servers. The EBI is an Outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).
