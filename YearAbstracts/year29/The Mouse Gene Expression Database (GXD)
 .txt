The Gene Expression Database (GXD) is a community resource of gene expression information for the laboratory mouse. By combining the different types of expression data, GXD aims to provide increasingly complete information about the expression profiles of genes in different mouse strains and mutants, thus enabling valuable insights into the molecular networks that underlie normal development and disease. GXD is integrated with the Mouse Genome Database (MGD). Extensive interconnections with sequence databases and with databases from other species, and the development and use of shared controlled vocabularies extend GXDâ€™s utility for the analysis of gene expression information. GXD is accessible through the Mouse Genome Informatics web site at http://www.informatics.jax.org/ or directly at http://www.informatics.jax.org/menus/expression_menu.shtml .
