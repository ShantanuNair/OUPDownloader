The Human Genome Project has generated extensive map and sequence data for a large number of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones. In order to maximize the efficient use of the data and to minimize the redundant work for the research community, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) comprehensive BAC resource (cBACr) (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/BacResource/BAC_resource_intro.html) was built as an expansion of the TIGR human BAC ends database. This resource collects, integrates and reports the information on library, maps, sequence, annotation and functions for each human and mouse BAC. The current database contains 635 016 human BACs and 265 617 mouse BACs that were characterized by various approaches, among which 22 705 human clones and 1000 mouse clones have sequence and annotation data.
