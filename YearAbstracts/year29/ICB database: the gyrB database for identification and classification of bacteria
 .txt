The Identification and Classification of Bacteria (ICB) database (http:/www.mbio.co.jp/icb) contains currently available information about the DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) gene in bacteria. The database is designed to provide the scientific community with a reference point for using gyrB as an evolutionary and taxonomic marker. Nucleic and amino acid sequence data are currently available for over 850 strains, along with alignments at several different taxonomic levels and an exhaustive review of primer selection and background information.
