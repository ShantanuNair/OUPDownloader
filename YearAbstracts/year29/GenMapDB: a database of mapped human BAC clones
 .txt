GenMapDB (http://genomics.med.upenn.edu/genmapdb) is a repository of human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones mapped by our laboratory to sequence-tagged site markers. Currently, GenMapDB contains over 3000 mapped clones that span 19 chromosomes, chromosomes 2, 4, 5, 9â€“22, X and Y. This database provides positional information about human BAC clones from the RPCI-11 human male BAC library. It also contains restriction fragment analysis data and end sequences of the clones. GenMapDB is freely available to the public. The main purpose of GenMapDB is to organize the mapping data and to allow the research community to search for mapped BAC clones that can be used in gene mapping studies and chromosomal mutation analysis projects.
