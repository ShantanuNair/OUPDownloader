PseudoBase is a database containing structural, functional and sequence data related to RNA pseudo­knots. It can be reached at http://wwwbio.LeidenUniv.nl/∼Batenburg/PKB.html. For each pseudoknot, thirteen items are stored, for example the relevant sequence, the stem positions of the pseudoknot, the EMBL accession number of the sequence and the support that can be given regarding the reliability of the pseudo­knot. Since the last publication, information on sizes of the stems and the loops in the pseudoknots has been added. Also added are alternative entries that produce surveys of where the pseudoknots are, sorted according to stem size or loop size.
