The database, called HyPaLib (for Hybrid Pattern Library), contains annotated structural elements characteristic for certain classes of structural and/or functional RNAs. These elements are described in a language specifically designed for this purpose. The language allows convenient specification of hybrid patterns, i.e. motifs consisting of sequence features and structural elements together with sequence similarity and thermodynamic constraints. We are currently developing software tools that allow a user to search sequence databases for any pattern in HyPaLib, thus providing functionality which is similar to PROSITE, but dedicated to the more complex patterns in RNA sequences. HyPaLib is available at http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/HyPa/.
