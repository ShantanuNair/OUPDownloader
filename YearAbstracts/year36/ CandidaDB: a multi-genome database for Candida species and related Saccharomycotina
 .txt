 CandidaDB ( http://genodb.pasteur.fr/CandidaDB ) was established in 2002 to provide the first genomic database for the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans . The availability of an increasing number of fully or partially completed genome sequences of related fungal species has opened the path for comparative genomics and prompted us to migrate CandidaDB into a multi-genome database. The new version of CandidaDB houses the latest versions of the genomes of C. albicans strains SC5314 and WO-1 along with six genome sequences from species closely related to C. albicans that all belong to the CTG clade of Saccharomycotina—Candida tropicalis , Candida (Clavispora) lusitaniae , Candida (Pichia) guillermondii, Lodderomyces elongisporus , Debaryomyces hansenii, Pichia stipitis —and the reference Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. CandidaDB includes sequences coding for 54 170 proteins with annotations collected from other databases, enriched with illustrations of structural features and functional domains and data of comparative analyses. In order to take advantage of the integration of multiple genomes in a unique database, new tools using pre-calculated or user-defined comparisons have been implemented that allow rapid access to comparative analysis at the genomic scale.
