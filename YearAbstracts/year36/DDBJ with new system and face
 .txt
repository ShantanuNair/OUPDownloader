 DDBJ ( http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp ) collected and released 1 880 115 entries or 1 134 086 245 bases in the period from July 2006 to June 2007. The released data contains the high-throughput cDNAs of cricket and high-quality draft genome of medaka among others. Our computer system has been upgraded since March 2007. Another new aspect is an efficient data retrieval tool that has recently been equipped and served at DDBJ. It is called All-round Retrieval for Sequence and Annotation, which enables the user to search for keywords also in the Feature/Qualifier of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration ( http://www.insdc.org/ ). We will also replace our home page with a more efficient one by the end of 2007.
