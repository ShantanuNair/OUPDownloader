 The starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis , is a basal metazoan organism that has recently emerged as an important model system in developmental biology and evolutionary genomics. StellaBase , the Nematostella Genomics Database ( http://stellabase.org ), was developed in 2005 as a resource to support the Nematostella research community. Recently, it has become apparent that Nematostella may be a particularly useful system for studying (i) microevolutionary variation in natural populations, and (ii) the functional evolution of human disease genes. We have developed two new databases that will foster such studies: StellaBase Disease ( http://stellabase.org/disease ) is a relational database that houses 155 904 invertebrate homologous isoforms of human disease genes from four leading genomic model systems (fly, worm, yeast and Nematostella ), including 14 874 predicted genes from the sea anemone itself. StellaBase SNP ( http://stellabase.org/SNP ) is a relational database that describes the location and underlying type of mutation for 20 063 single nucleotide polymorphisms.
