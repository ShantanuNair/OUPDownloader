 The BioHealthBase Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) ( http://www.biohealthbase.org ) is a public bioinformatics database and analysis resource for the study of specific biodefense and public health pathogens— Influenza virus, Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Microsporidia species and ricin toxin. The BioHealthBase serves as an extensive integrated repository of data imported from public databases, data derived from various computational algorithms and information curated from the scientific literature. The goal of the BioHealthBase is to facilitate the development of therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines by integrating all available data in the context of host–pathogen interactions, thus allowing researchers to understand the root causes of virulence and pathogenicity. Genome and protein annotations can be viewed either as formatted text or graphically through a genome browser. 3D visualization capabilities allow researchers to view proteins with key structural and functional features highlighted. Influenza virus host–pathogen interactions at the molecular/cellular and systemic levels are represented. Host immune response to influenza infection is conveyed through the display of experimentally determined antibody and T-cell epitopes curated from the scientific literature or as derived from computational predictions. At the molecular/cellular level, the BioHealthBase BRC has developed biological pathway representations relevant to influenza virus host–pathogen interaction in collaboration with the Reactome database ( http://www.reactome.org ).
