 The past decade has seen the publication of a large number of cell-cycle microarray studies and many more are in the pipeline. However, data from these experiments are not easy to access, combine and evaluate. We have developed a centralized database with an easy-to-use interface, Cyclebase.org, for viewing and downloading these data. The user interface facilitates searches for genes of interest as well as downloads of genome-wide results. Individual genes are displayed with graphs of expression profiles throughout the cell cycle from all available experiments. These expression profiles are normalized to a common timescale to enable inspection of the combined experimental evidence. Furthermore, state-of-the-art computational analyses provide key information on both individual experiments and combined datasets such as whether or not a gene is periodically expressed and, if so, the time of peak expression. Cyclebase is available at http://www.cyclebase.org .
