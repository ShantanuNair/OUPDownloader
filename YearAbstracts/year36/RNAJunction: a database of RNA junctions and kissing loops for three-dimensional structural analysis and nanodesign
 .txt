 We developed a database called RNAJunction that contains structure and sequence information for RNA structural elements such as helical junctions, internal loops, bulges and loopâ€“loop interactions. Our database provides a user-friendly way of searching structural elements by PDB code, structural classification, sequence, keyword or inter-helix angles. In addition, the structural data was subjected to energy minimization. This database is useful for analyzing RNA structures as well as for designing novel RNA structures on a nanoscale. The database can be accessed at: http://rnajunction.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/
