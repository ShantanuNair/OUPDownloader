 MetaCrop is a manually curated repository of high quality information concerning the metabolism of crop plants. This includes pathway diagrams, reactions, locations, transport processes, reaction kinetics, taxonomy and literature. MetaCrop provides detailed information on six major crop plants with high agronomical importance and initial information about several other plants. The web interface supports an easy exploration of the information from overview pathways to single reactions and therefore helps users to understand the metabolism of crop plants. It also allows model creation and automatic data export for detailed models of metabolic pathways therefore supporting systems biology approaches. The MetaCrop database is accessible at http://metacrop.ipk-gatersleben.de .
