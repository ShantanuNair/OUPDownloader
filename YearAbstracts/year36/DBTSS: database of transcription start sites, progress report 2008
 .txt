 DBTSS is a database of transcriptional start sites, based on our unique collection of precise, experimentally determined 5′-end sequences of full-length cDNAs. Since its first release in 2002, several major updates have been made. In this update, we expanded the human transcriptional start site dataset by 19 million uniquely mapped, and RefSeq-associated, 5′-end sequences, which were generated by a newly introduced Solexa sequencer. Moreover, in order to provide means for interpreting those massive TSS data, we implemented two new analytical tools: one for connecting expression information with predicted transcription factor binding sites; the other for examining evolutionary conservation or species-specificity of promoters and transcripts, which can be browsed by our own comparative genome viewer. With the expanded dataset and the enhanced functionalities, DBTSS provides a unique platform that enables in-depth transcriptome analyses. DBTSS is accessible at http://dbtss.hgc.jp/ .
