 New methods and tools are needed to exploit the unprecedented source of information made available by the completed and ongoing whole genome sequencing projects. The Narcisse database is dedicated to the study of genome conservation, from sequence similarities to conserved chromosomal segments or conserved syntenies, for a large number of animals, plants and bacterial completely sequenced genomes. The query interface, a comparative genome browser, enables to navigate between genome dotplots, comparative maps and sequence alignments. The Narcisse database can be accessed at http://narcisse.toulouse.inra.fr .
