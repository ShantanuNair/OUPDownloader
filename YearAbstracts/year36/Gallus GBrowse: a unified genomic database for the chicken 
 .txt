Gallus GBrowse ( http://birdbase.net/cgi-bin/gbrowse/gallus/ ) provides online access to genomic and other information about the chicken, Gallus gallus . The information provided by this resource includes predicted genes and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, links to Gallus In Situ Hybridization Analysis (GEISHA), Unigene and Reactome, the genomic positions of chicken genetic markers, SNPs and microarray probes, and mappings from turkey, condor and zebra finch DNA and EST sequences to the chicken genome. We also provide a BLAT server ( http://birdbase.net/cgi-bin/webBlat ) for matching user-provided sequences to the chicken genome. These tools make the Gallus GBrowse server a valuable resource for researchers seeking genomic information regarding the chicken and other avian species.
