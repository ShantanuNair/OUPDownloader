 AAindex is a database of numerical indices representing various physicochemical and biochemical properties of amino acids and pairs of amino acids. We have added a collection of protein contact potentials to the AAindex as a new section. Accordingly AAindex consists of three sections now: AAindex1 for the amino acid index of 20 numerical values, AAindex2 for the amino acid substitution matrix and AAindex3 for the statistical protein contact potentials. All data are derived from published literature. The database can be accessed through the DBGET/LinkDB system at GenomeNet ( http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bfind?aaindex ) or downloaded by anonymous FTP ( ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/db/community/aaindex/ ).
