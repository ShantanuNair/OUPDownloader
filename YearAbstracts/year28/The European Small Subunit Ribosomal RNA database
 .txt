The European database of the Small Subunit (SSU) Ribosomal RNA is a curated database that strives to collect all information about the primary and secondary structure of completely or nearly-completely sequenced rRNAs. Furthermore, the database compiles additional information such as literature references and taxonomic status of the organism the sequence was derived from. The database can be consulted via the WWW at URL http://rrna.uia.ac.be/ssu/ . Through the WWW, sequences can be easily selected either one by one, by taxonomic group, or by a combination of both, and can be retrieved in different sequence and alignment formats.
