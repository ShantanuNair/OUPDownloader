XREFdb supports the investigation of protein function in the context of information available through work in multiple organisms. In addition to facilitating the association of functional data among known genes from multiple organisms, XREFdb has developed strategies that provide access to information associated with as-yet unstudied genes. The database organizes protein similarity and genetic map positional information from diverse sources in the public domain to facilitate investigator evaluation of potential functional signifiÂ­cance.
