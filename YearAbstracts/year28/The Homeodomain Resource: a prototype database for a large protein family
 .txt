The Homeodomain Resource is an annotated collection of non-redundant protein sequences, three-dimensional structures and genomic information for the homeodomain protein family. Release 2.0 contains 765 full-length homeodomain-containing sequences, 29 experiÂ­mentally derived structures and 116 homeobox loci implicated in human genetic disorders. Entries are fully hyperlinked to facilitate easy retrieval of the original records from source databases. A simple search engine with a graphical user interface is provided to query the component databases and assemble customized data sets. A new feature for this release is the addition of more automated methods for database searching, maintenance and implementation of efficient data management. The Homeodomain Resource is freely available through the WWW at http://genome.nhgri.nih.gov/homeodomain
