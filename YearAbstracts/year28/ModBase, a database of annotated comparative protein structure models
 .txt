ModBase is a queryable database of annotated comparative protein structure models. The models are derived by ModPipe, an automated modeling pipeline relying on the programs PSI-BLAST and Modeller. The database currently contains 3D models for substantial portions of approximately 17Â 000 proteins from 10 complete genomes, including those of Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, as well as all the available sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana and Homo sapiens. The database also includes fold assignments and alignments on which the models were based. In addition, special care is taken to assess the quality of the models.
