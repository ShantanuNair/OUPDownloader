The RESID Database contains supplemental information on post-translational modifications for the standardized annotations appearing in the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database. The RESID Database includes: systematic and frequently observed alternate names, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers, atomic formulas and weights, enzyme activities, indicators for N-terminal, C-terminal or peptide chain cross-link modifications, keywords, literature citations with database cross-references, structural diagrams and molecular models. Since 1995 updates of the RESID Database have appeared as often as weekly, and full releases appear quarterly. The database is freely accessible through the PIR Web site http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/resid.html and by FTP.
