Axeldb is a database storing and integrating gene expression patterns and DNA sequences identified in a large-scale in situ hybridization study in Xenopus laevis embryos. The data are organised in a format appropriate for comprehensive analysis, and enable comparison of images of expression pattern for any given set of genes. Information on literature, cDNA clones and their availability, nucleotide sequences, expression pattern and accompanying pictures are available. Current developments are aimed toward the interconnection with other databases and the integration of data from the literature. Axeldb is implemented using an ACEDB database system, and available through the web at  http://www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/abt0135/axeldb.htm
