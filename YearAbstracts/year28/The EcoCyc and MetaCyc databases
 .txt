EcoCyc is an organism-specific Pathway/Genome Database that describes the metabolic and signal-transduction pathways of Escherichia coli, its enzymes, and—a new addition—its transport proteins. MetaCyc is a new metabolic-pathway database that describes pathways and enzymes of many different organisms, with a microbial focus. Both databases are queried using the Pathway Tools graphical user interface, which provides a wide variety of query operations and visualization tools. EcoCyc and MetaCyc are available at http://ecocyc.PangeaSystems. com/ecocyc/
