The Human BAC Ends database includes all non-redundant human BAC end sequences (BESs) generated by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), the University of Washington (UW) and California Institute of Technology (CalTech). It incorporates the available BAC mapping data from different genome centers and the annotation results of each end sequence for the contents of repeats, ESTs and STS markers. For each BAC end the database integrates the sequence, the phred quality scores, the map and the annotation, and provides links to sites of the library information, the reports of GenBank, dbGSS and GDB, and other relevant data. The database is freely accessible via the web and supports sequence or clone searches and anonymous FTP. The relevant sites and resources are described at http://www. tigr.org/tdb/humgen/bac_end_search/bac_end_intro.html
