SELEX_DB is a novel curated database on selected randomized DNA/RNA sequences designed for accumulation of experimental data on functional site sequences obtained by using SELEX and SELEX-like technologies from the pools of random sequences. This database also contains the programs for DNA/RNA functional site recognition within arbitrary nucleotide sequences. The first release of SELEX_DB has been installed under SRS and is available through the WWW at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/systems/selex/
