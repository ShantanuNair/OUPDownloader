ooTFD (object-oriented Transcription Factors Database) is an object-oriented successor to TFD. This database is aimed at capturing information regarding the polypeptide interactions which comprise and define the properties of transcription factors. ooTFD contains information about transcription factor binding sites, as well as composite relationships within transcription factors, which frequently occur as multisubunit proteins that form a complex interface to cellular processes outside the transcription machinery through proteinâ€“protein interactions. In the past year, a few additions and changes were made to this database and associated tools, which are accessible through the IFTI-MIRAGE web site at http://www.ifti.org/
