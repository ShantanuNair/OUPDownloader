It is now clear that the homeobox motif is well conserved across metazoan phyla. It has been established experimentally that a subset of genes containing this motif plays key roles in the orchestration of gene expression during development. Auto- and cross-regulatory functional interactions join homeobox genes into genetic networks. We have developed a specialized database HOX-Pro in order to arrange all available data on structure, function, phylogeny and evolution of Hox genes, Hox clusters and Hox networks. Its primary location is http://www.iephb.nw.ru/hoxpro . The database is also mirrored at http://www.mssm.edu/molbio/hoxpro . The HOX-Pro database is aimed at: (i) analysis and classification of regulatory and coding regions in diverse homeobox and related genes; (ii) comparative analysis of organization of ‘Hox-based’ genetic networks in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the mouse Mus musculus; and (iii) analysis of phylo­geny and evolution of homeobox genes and clusters.
