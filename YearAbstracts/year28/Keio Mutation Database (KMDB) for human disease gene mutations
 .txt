A database of mutations in human disease-causing genes has been constructed and named as Keio Mutation Database (KMDB). This KMDB utilizes a database software called MutationView which was designed to compile various mutation data and to provide graphical presentation of data analysis. Currently, the KMDB accommodates mutation data of 38 different genes for 35 different diseases which are involved in eye, heart, ear and brain. These KMDBs are accessible through http://mutview.dmb. med.keio.ac.jp with advanced internet browsers.
