ProDom contains all protein domain families automatically generated from the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL sequence databases (http://www.toulouse. inra.fr/prodom.html ). ProDom-CG results from a similar domain analysis as applied to completed genomes (http://www.toulouse.inra.fr/prodomCG.html ). Recent improvements to the ProDom database and its server include: scaling up to include sequences from TrEMBL, addition of Pfam-A entries to the set of expert validated families, assignment of stable accession numbers, consistency indicators for domain families, domain arrangements of sub-families and links to Pfam-A.
