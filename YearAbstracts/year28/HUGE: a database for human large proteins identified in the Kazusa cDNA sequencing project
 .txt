HUGE is a database for human large proteins newly identified in the Kazusa cDNA project, the aim of which is to predict the primary structure of proteins from the sequences of human large cDNAs (>4 kb). In particular, cDNA clones capable of coding for large proteins (>50 kDa) are the current targets of the project. HUGE contains >1100 cDNA sequences and detailed information obtained through analysis of the sequences of cDNAs and the predicted proteins. Besides an increase in the number of cDNA entries, the amount of experimental data for expression profiling has been largely increased and data on chromosomal locations have been newly added. All of the protein-coding regions were examined by GeneMark analysis, and the results of a motif/domain search of each predicted protein sequence against the Pfam database have been newly added. HUGE is available through the WWW at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/huge
