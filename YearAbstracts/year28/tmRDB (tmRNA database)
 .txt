The tmRNA database (tmRDB) is maintained at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler, Texas, and is accessible on the WWW at URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/tmRDB/tmRDB.html . A tmRDB mirror site is located on the campus of Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, reachable at the URL http://www.ag.auburn.edu/mirror/tmRDB/ . Since April 1997, the tmRDB has provided sequences of tmRNA (previously called 10Sa RNA), a molecule present in most bacteria and some organelles. This release adds 17 new sequences for a total of 60 tmRNAs. Sequences and corresponding tmRNA-encoded tag peptides are tabulated in alphabetical and phyloÂ­genetic order. The updated tmRNA alignment improves the secondary structures of known tmRNAs on the level of individual basepairs. tmRDB also provides an introduction to tmRNA function in trans-translation (with links to relevant literature), a limited number of tmRNA secondary structure diagrams, and numerous three-dimensional models generated interactively with the program ERNA-3D.
