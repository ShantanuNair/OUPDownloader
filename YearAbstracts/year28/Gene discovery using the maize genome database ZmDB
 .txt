Zea mays DataBase (ZmDB) is a repository and analysis tool for sequence, expression and phenotype data of the major crop plant maize. The data accessible in ZmDB are mostly generated in a large collaborative project of maize gene discovery, sequencing and phenotypic analysis using a transposon tagging strategy and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing. ESTs constitute most of the current content. Database search tools, convenient links to external databases, and novel sequence analysis programs for spliced alignment are provided and together serve as an efficient protocol for gene discovery by sequence inspection. ZmDB can be accessed at http://zmdb. iastate.edu . ZmDB also provides web-based ordering of materials generated in the project, including EST and genomic DNA clones, seeds of mutant plants and microarrays of amplified EST and genomic DNA sequences.
