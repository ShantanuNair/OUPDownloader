The NCBI has introduced two new web resources—LocusLink and RefSeq—that facilitate retrieval of gene-based information and provide reference sequence standards. These resources are designed to provide a non-redundant view of current knowledge about human genes, transcripts and proteins. Additional information about these resources is available on the LocusLink web site at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/
