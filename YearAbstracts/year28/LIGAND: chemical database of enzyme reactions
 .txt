LIGAND is a composite database comprising three sections: ENZYME for the information of enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions, COMPOUND for the information of metabolites and other chemical compounds, and REACTION for the collection of substrateâ€“product relations. The current release includes 3390 enzymes, 5645 compounds and 5207 reactions. The database is indispensable for the reconstruction of metabolic pathways in the completely sequenced organisms. The LIGAND database can be accessed through the WWW (http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget/ligand.html ) or may be downloaded by anonymous FTP (ftp://kegg.genome.ad.jp/molecules/ligand/ ).
