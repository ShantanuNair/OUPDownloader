Transcription Regulatory Regions Database (TRRD) has been developed for accumulation of experimental information on the structure–function features of regulatory regions of eukaryotic genes. Each entry in TRRD corresponds to a particular gene and contains a description of structure–function features of its regulatory regions (transcription factor binding sites, promoters, enhancers, silencers, etc.) and gene expression regulation patterns. The current release, TRRD 4.2.5, comprises the description of 760 genes, 3403 expression patterns, and >4600 regulatory elements including 3604 transcription factor binding sites, 600 promoters and 152 enhancers. This information was obtained through annotation of 2537 scientific publications. TRRD 4.2.5 is available through the WWW at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/dbases/trrd4/
