The identification of a constantly increasing number of genes whose mutations are causally implicated in tumor initiation and progression (cancer genes) requires the development of tools to store and analyze them. The Network of Cancer Genes (NCG 3.0) collects information on 1494 cancer genes that have been found mutated in 16 different cancer types. These genes were collected from the Cancer Gene Census as well as from 18 whole exome and 11 whole-genome screenings of cancer samples. For each cancer gene, NCG 3.0 provides a summary of the gene features and the cross-reference to other databases. In addition, it describes duplicability, evolutionary origin, orthology, network properties, interaction partners, microRNA regulation and functional roles of cancer genes and of all genes that are related to them. This integrated network of information can be used to better characterize cancer genes in the context of the system in which they act. The data can also be used to identify novel candidates that share the same properties of known cancer genes and may therefore play a similar role in cancer.
