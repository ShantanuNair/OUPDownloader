SNPedia (http://www.SNPedia.com) is a wiki resource of the functional consequences of human genetic variation as published in peer-reviewed studies. Online since 2006 and freely available for personal use, SNPedia has focused on the medical, phenotypic and genealogical associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Entries are formatted to allow associations to be assigned to single genotypes as well as sets of genotypes (genosets). In this article, we discuss the growth of this resource and its use by affiliated software to create personal genome reports.
