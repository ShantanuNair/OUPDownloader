Notophthalmus viridescens, a member of the salamander family is an excellent model organism to study regenerative processes due to its unique ability to replace lost appendages and to repair internal organs. Molecular insights into regenerative events have been severely hampered by the lack of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data, as well as an appropriate database to store such novel information. Here, we describe ‘Newt-omics’ (http://newt-omics.mpi-bn.mpg.de), a database, which enables researchers to locate, retrieve and store data sets dedicated to the molecular characterization of newts. Newt-omics is a transcript-centred database, based on an Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data set from the newt, covering ∼50 000 Sanger sequenced transcripts and a set of high-density microarray data, generated from regenerating hearts. Newt-omics also contains a large set of peptides identified by mass spectrometry, which was used to validate 13 810 ESTs as true protein coding. Newt-omics is open to implement additional high-throughput data sets without changing the database structure. Via a user-friendly interface Newt-omics allows access to a huge set of molecular data without the need for prior bioinformatical expertise.
