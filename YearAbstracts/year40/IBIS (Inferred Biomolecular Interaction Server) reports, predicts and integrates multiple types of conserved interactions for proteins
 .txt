We have recently developed the Inferred Biomolecular Interaction Server (IBIS) and database, which reports, predicts and integrates different types of interaction partners and locations of binding sites in proteins based on the analysis of homologous structural complexes. Here, we highlight several new IBIS features and options. The server's webpage is now redesigned to allow users easier access to data for different interaction types. An entry page is added to give a quick summary of available results and to now accept protein sequence accessions. To elucidate the formation of protein complexes, not just binary interactions, IBIS currently presents an expandable interaction network. Previously, IBIS provided annotations for four different types of binding partners: proteins, small molecules, nucleic acids and peptides; in the current version a new proteinâ€“ion interaction type has been added. Several options provide easy downloads of IBIS data for all Protein Data Bank (PDB) protein chains and the results for each query. In this study, we show that about one-third of all RefSeq sequences can be annotated with IBIS interaction partners and binding sites. The IBIS server is available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/ibis/ibis.cgi and updated biweekly.
