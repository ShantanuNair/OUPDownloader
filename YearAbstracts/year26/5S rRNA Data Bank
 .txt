 In this paper we present the updated version of the compilation of 5S rRNA and 5S rDNA nucleotide sequences. It contains 1622 primary structures of 5S rRNAs and 5S rRNA genes from 888 species. These include 58 archaeal, 427 eubacterial, 34 plastid, nine mitochondrial and 1094 eukaryotic DNA or RNA nucleotide sequences. The sequence entries are divided according to the taxonomic position of the organisms. All individual sequences deposited in the 5S rRNA Database can be retrieved using the WWW-based, taxonomic browser at http:www.//rose.man.poznan.pl/5SData/5SRNA.html or http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/fb_chemie/agerdmann/5S_rRNA.html . The files with complete sets of data as well as sequence alignments are available via anonymous ftp.
