 Last year, the original Glucocorticoid Receptor Resource expanded into a comprehensive project: the Nuclear Receptor Resource (NRR, http://nrr.georgetown.edu/nrr/nrr.html ). The NRR has since been offering comprehensive information on nuclear receptor structure and function, as well as general facts of interest to the scientific community on meetings, funding and employment opportunities. The project now includes individual resources as part of a network which integrates information on glucocorticoid, androgen, mineralocorticoid, thyroid hormone, Vitamin D and peroxisome-proliferator activated receptors. Many investigators have joined the NRR network by filling out the Who is who? form available in the NRR home page. This has facilitated communication among scientists in the field and dissemination of data not otherwise published. Because several investigators have contacted NRR authors over the past few months asking for advice and materials for educational purposes, we have recently decided to include in our project an educational resource on nuclear receptors termed the ‘Graphics Library’. The input and suggestions of NRR users do shape the future direction of the project, so we encourage users to continue to give us feedback.
