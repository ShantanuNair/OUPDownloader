 We at the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) ( http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp ) have recently begun receiving, processing and releasing EST and genome sequence data submitted by various Japanese genome projects. The data include those for human, Arabidopsis thaliana , rice, nematode, Synechocystis sp . and Escherichia coli . Since the quantity of data is very large, we organized teams to conduct preliminary discussions with project teams about data submission and handling for release to the public. We also developed a mass submission tool to cope with a large quantity of data. In addition, to provide genome data on WWW, we developed a genome information system using Java. This system ( http://mol.genes.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/ ) can in theory be used for any genome sequence data. These activities will facilitate processing of large quantities of EST and genome data.
