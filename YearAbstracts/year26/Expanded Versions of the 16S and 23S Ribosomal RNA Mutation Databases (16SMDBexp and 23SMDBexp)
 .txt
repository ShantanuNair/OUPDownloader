 Expanded versions of the Ribosomal RNA Mutation Databases provide lists of mutated positions in 16S and 16S-like ribosomal RNA (16SMDBexp) and 23S and 23S-like ribosomal RNA (23SMDBexp) and the identity of each alteration. Alterations from organisms other than Escherichia coli are reported at positions according to the E.coli numbering system. Information provided for each mutation includes: (i) a brief description of the phenotype(s) associated with each mutation, (ii) whether a mutant phenotype has been detected by in vivo or in vitro methods, and (iii) relevant literature citations. The databases are available via ftp and on the World Wide Web at the following URL: http://www.fandm.edu/Departments/Biology/Databases/RNA.html
