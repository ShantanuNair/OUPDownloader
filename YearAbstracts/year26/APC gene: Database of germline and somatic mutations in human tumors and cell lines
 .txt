 A database ( http://perso.curie.fr/tsoussi ) is described, in which over 1000 mutations in the human APC gene of tumors (colon cancer predominantly) are compiled from the literature. It includes both molecular information about the mutations and clinical data about the patients. Software has been designed to analyse all this information in the database.
