 The Genome Database (GDB, http://www.gdb.org ) is a public repository of data on human genes, clones, STSs, polymorphisms and maps. GDB entries are highly cross-linked to each other, to literature citations and to entries in other databases, including the sequence databases, OMIM, and the Mouse Genome Database. Mapping data from large genome centers and smaller mapping efforts are added to GDB on an ongoing basis. The database can be searched by a variety of methods, ranging from keyword searches to complex queries. Major functionality extensions in the last year include the ongoing computation of integrated human genome maps, called Comprehensive Maps, and the use of those maps to support positional queries and graphic displays. The capabilities of the GDB map viewer (Mapview) have been extended to include map printing and the graphical display of ad hoc query results. The HUGO Nomenclature Committee continues to curate the proposed and official gene symbols and related data in collaboration with GDB. As genome research shifts its emphasis from mapping to sequencing and functional analysis, the scope of the GDB schema is being extended. We are in the process of adding representations of gene function and expression, and improving our representation of human polymorphism and mutation.
