 This database consists of over 24 000 mutations in 18 viral, bacterial, yeast or mammalian genes. The data are grouped as sets of DNA base sequence changes or spectra caused by a particular mutagen under defined conditions. The spectra are available on the World Wide Web at http://info.med.yale.edu/mutbase/ in two formats; in text format that can be browsed on-line or downloaded for use with a text editor and in dBASEIII format for use, after downloading, by relational database programs or by spreadsheets. Researchers are encouraged to submit DNA sequence changes to a suitable mutation database such as ours. A data entry program, MUTSIN, can be retrieved from this site. MUTSIN diagrams each mutation on the computer screen and alerts the user to any discrepancies.
