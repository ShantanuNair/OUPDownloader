 The current version of the androgen receptor (AR) gene mutations database is described. The total number of reported mutations has risen from 272 to 309 in the past year. We have expanded the database: (i) by giving each entry an accession number; (ii) by adding information on the length of polymorphic polyglutamine (polyGln) and polyglycine (polyGly) tracts in exon 1; (iii) by adding information on large gene deletions; (iv) by providing a direct link with a completely searchable database (courtesy EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute). The addition of the exon 1 polymorphisms is discussed in light of their possible relevance as markers for predisposition to prostate or breast cancer. The database is also available on the internet ( http://www.mcgill.ca/androgendb/ ), from EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute ( ftp://www.ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/androgen ), or as a Macintosh FilemakerPro or Word file ( MC33@musica.mcgill.ca ).
