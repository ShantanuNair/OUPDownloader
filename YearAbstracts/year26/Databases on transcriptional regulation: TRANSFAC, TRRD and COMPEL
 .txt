 TRANSFAC, TRRD (Transcription Regulatory Region Database) and COMPEL are databases which store information about transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. The three databases provide distinct views on the components involved in transcription: transcription factors and their binding sites and binding profiles (TRANSFAC), the regulatory hierarchy of whole genes (TRRD), and the structural and functional properties of composite elements (COMPEL). The quantitative and qualitative changes of all three databases and connected programs are described. The databases are accessible via WWW: http://transfac.gbf.de/TRANSFAC or http://www.bionet.nsc.ru/TRRD
