 The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) is an annotated non-redundant collection of experimentally characterised eukaryotic POL II promoters. The underlying definition of a promoter is that of a transcription initiation site. All information presented in EPD results from an independent evaluation of primary experimental data shown in the biological literature. Sequences flanking transcription initiation sites are indirectly given by pointers to EMBL sequences. The annotation part of a promoter entry includes description of the promoter-defining evidence, cross-references to other databases, and bibliographic references. Being designed as a resource for comparative sequence analysis, EPD is structured in a way that facilitates dynamic extraction of biologically meaningful promoter subsets. The database is available through the World Wide Web at URL http://cmpteam4.unil.ch
