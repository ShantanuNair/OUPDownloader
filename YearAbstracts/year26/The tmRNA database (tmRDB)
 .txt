 This first release of the tmRNA database (tmRDB) contains 19 tmRNA sequences, a tmRNA sequence alignment with emphasis of base pairs that are supported by comparative sequence analysis, and a tabulation of tmRNA-encoded tag peptides. The tmRNADB also offers an RNA secondary structure diagram of the Escherichia coli tmRNA, as well as PDB-formatted coordinates for three-dimensional modeling. The data are available on the World Wide Web at http://www.uthct.edu/tmRDB/tmRDB.html
