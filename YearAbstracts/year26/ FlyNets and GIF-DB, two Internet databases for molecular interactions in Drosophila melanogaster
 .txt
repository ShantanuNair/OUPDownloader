 GIF-DB and FlyNets are two WWW databases describing molecular (protein-DNA, protein-RNA and protein-protein) interactions occuring in the fly Drosophila melanogaster ( http://gifts.univ-mrs.fr/GIFTS_home_page.html ). GIF-DB is a specialised database which focuses on molecular interactions involved in the process of embryonic pattern formation, whereas FlyNets is a new and more general database, the long-term goal of which is to report on any published molecular interaction occuring in the fly. The information content of both databases is distributed in specific lines arranged into an EMBL- (or GenBank-) like format. These databases achieve a high level of integration with other databases such as FlyBase, EMBL, GenBank and SWISS-PROT through numerous hyperlinks. In addition, we also describe SOS-DGDB, a new collection of annotated Drosophila gene sequences, in which binding sites for regulatory proteins are directly visible on the DNA primary sequence and hyperlinked both to GIF-DB and TRANSFAC database entries.
