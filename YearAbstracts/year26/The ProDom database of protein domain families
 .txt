 The ProDom database contains protein domain families generated from the SWISS-PROT database by automated sequence comparisons. It can be searched on the World Wide Web ( http://protein.toulouse.inra.fr/ prodom.html ) or by E-mail ( prodom@toulouse.inra.fr ) to study domain arrangements within known families or new proteins. Strong emphasis has been put on the graphical user interface which allows for interactive analysis of protein homology relationships. Recent improvements to the server include: ProDom search by keyword; links to PROSITE and PDB entries; more sensitive ProDom similarity search with BLAST or WU-BLAST; alignments of query sequences with homologous ProDom domain families; and links to the SWISS-MODEL server ( http://www.expasy.ch/swissmod/ SWISS-MODEL.html ) for homology based 3-D domain modelling where possible.
