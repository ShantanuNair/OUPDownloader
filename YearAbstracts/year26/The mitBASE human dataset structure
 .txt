 MitBASE is a comprehensive and integrated mitochondrial genome database funded within the EU BIOTECH PROGRAM. It is a project for the development and implementation of an integrated and comprehensive database of mitochondrial data which will collect all available information from different organisms and from intraspecies variants and mutants. The present paper describes the structure of the Human dataset in mit-BASE where human molecular data are distinguished from clinical and pathological data.
