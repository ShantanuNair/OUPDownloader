 Guide RNAs (gRNAs) are small, metabolically stable RNA molecules which perform a pivotal, template-like function during the RNA editing process in kinetoplastid protozoa. The gRNA database currently contains 250 guide RNA sequences as well as secondary and tertiary structure models and other relevant information. The database is made available as a hypertext document accessible via the World Wide Web (WWW) at the URL: http://www.biochem.mpg.de/~goeringe/
