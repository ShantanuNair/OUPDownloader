 Ribonuclease P is responsible for the 5â€²-maturation of tRNA precursors. Ribonuclease P is a ribonucleoprotein, and in bacteria the RNA subunit alone is catalytically active in vitro , i.e., it is a ribozyme. The Ribonuclease P Database is a compilation of ribonuclease P sequences, sequence alignments, secondary structures, three-dimensional models and accessory information, available via the World Wide Web ( http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/RNaseP/home.html ).
