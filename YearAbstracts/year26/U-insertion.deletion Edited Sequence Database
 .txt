 Uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing is a post-transcriptional RNA modification occurring in the mitochondria of kinetoplastid protozoa. The U-insertion/deletion Edited Sequence Database is a compilation of mitochondrial genes and edited mRNAs from five kinetoplastid species. It contains separate files with the DNA, mRNA (both unedited and edited) and predicted protein sequences, as well as alignments of the Leishmania tarentolae and Trypanosoma brucei protein sequences from edited and unedited genes. The sequence files are in GCG format. A ‘map’ sequence file showing the location of U-deletions, U-insertions and the translated amino acid sequences is also provided for each gene. Genomic maps for each species are also provided with clickable genes, including maxicircle-encoded gRNAs. Sets of aligned nuclear rRNA sequences from kinetoplastid protozoa are also provided, which were used for phylogenetic reconstructions in an analysis of the origin of RNA editing. The database is available through the World Wide Web as an HTML document at the URL http://www.lifesci.ucla.edu/RNA/trypanosome/database.html
