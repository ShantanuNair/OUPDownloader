 Searches of the major public protein databases with core and linker chicken and human histone sequences have resulted in the compilation of an annotated set of histone protein sequences. In addition, new database searches with two distinct motif search algorithms have identified several members of the histone fold family, including human DRAP1 and yeast CSE4. Database resources include information on conflicts between similar sequence entries in different source databases, multiple sequence alignments, links to the Entrez integrated information retrieval system, structures for histone and histone fold proteins, and the ability to visualize structural data through Cn3D. The database currently contains >1000 protein sequences, which are searchable by protein type, accession number, organism name, or any other free text appearing in the definition line of the entry. All sequences and alignments in this database are available through the World Wide Web at http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/DIR/GTB/HISTONES or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Baxevani/HISTONES
