 The RNA modification database provides a comprehensive listing of posttranscriptionally modified nucleosides from RNA, and is maintained as an updated version of the initial printed report [Limbach,P.A., Crain,P.F. and McCloskey,J.A. (1994) Nucleic Acids Res. , 22, 2183â€“2196]. Information provided for each nucleoside includes: the type of RNA in which it occurs and phylogenetic distribution; common chemical name and symbol; Chemical Abstracts registry number and index name; chemical structure; initial literature citations for structural characterization or occurrence, and for chemical synthesis. The data are available through the World Wide Web at: http://www-medlib.med.utah.edu/RNAmods/RNAmods.html
