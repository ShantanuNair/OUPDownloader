 The Yeast Protein Database (YPD) is a curated database for the proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . It consists of ∼6000 Yeast Protein Reports, one for each of the known or predicted yeast proteins. Each Yeast Protein Report is a one-page presentation of protein properties, annotation lines that summarize findings from the literature, and references. In the past year, the number of annotation lines has grown from 25 000 to ∼35 000, and the number of articles curated has grown from ∼3500 to >5000. Recently, new data types have been included in YPD: protein-protein interactions, genetic interactions, and regulators of gene expression. Finally, a new layer of information, the YPD Protein Minireviews, has recently been introduced. The Yeast Protein Database can be found on the Web at http://www.proteome.com/YPDhome.html
