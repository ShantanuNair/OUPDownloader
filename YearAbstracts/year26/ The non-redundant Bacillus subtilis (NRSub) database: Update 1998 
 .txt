 The non-redundant Bacillus subtilis database (NRSub) has been developed in the context of the sequencing project devoted to this bacterium. As this project has reached completion, the whole genome is now available as a single contig. Thanks to the ACNUC database management system and its associated retrieval system Query_win, each functional region of the genome can be accessed individually. Extra annotations have been added such as accession numbers for the genes, locations on the genetic map, codon adaptation index values, as well as cross-references with other collections. NRSub is distributed through anonymous FTP as a text file in EMBL format and as an ACNUC database. It is also possible to access NRSub through two dedicated World Wide Web servers located in France ( http://acnuc.univ-lyon1.fr/nrsub/nrsub.html ) and in Japan ( http://ddbjs4h.genes.nig.ac.jp/ ).
