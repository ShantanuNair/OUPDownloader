 The SWISS‐MODEL Repository is a database of annotated three‐dimensional comparative protein structure models generated by the fully automated homology‐modelling pipeline SWISS‐MODEL. The Repository currently contains about 300 000 three‐dimensional models for sequences from the Swiss‐Prot and TrEMBL databases. The content of the Repository is updated on a regular basis incorporating new sequences, taking advantage of new template structures becoming available and reflecting improvements in the underlying modelling algorithms. Each entry consists of one or more three‐dimensional protein models, the superposed template structures, the alignments on which the models are based, a summary of the modelling process and a force field based quality assessment. The SWISS‐MODEL Repository can be queried via an interactive website at http://swissmodel.expasy. org/repository/ . Annotation and cross‐linking of the models with other databases, e.g. Swiss‐Prot on the ExPASy server, allow for seamless navigation between protein sequence and structure information. The aim of the SWISS‐MODEL Repository is to provide access to an up‐to‐date collection of annotated three‐dimensional protein models generated by automated homology modelling, bridging the gap between sequence and structure databases.
