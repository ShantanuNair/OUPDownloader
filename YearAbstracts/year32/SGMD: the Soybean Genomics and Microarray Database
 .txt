 The Soybean Genomics and Microarray Database (SGMD) attempts to provide an integrated view of the interaction of soybean with the soybean cyst nematode and contains genomic, EST and microarray data with embedded analytical tools allowing correlation of soybean ESTs with their gene expression profiles. SGMD provides analytical tools to mine the microarray data quickly by integrating many analysis methods within the database itself. The expression profiles of genes at time intervals during the first 8 days of nematode invasion is searchable by gene name or GenBank accession number. Recent developments include the addition of a searchable database for soybean cyst nematode ESTs and photographs of the invasion process at time points examined using microarrays. SGMD is completely accessible from the web at: http://psi081.ba.ars.usda.gov/SGMD/default.htm .
