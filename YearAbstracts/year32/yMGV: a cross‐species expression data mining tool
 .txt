 The yeast Microarray Global Viewer (yMGV @ http://transcriptome.ens.fr/ymgv ) was created 3 years ago as a database that houses a collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharo myces pombe microarray data sets published in 82 different articles. yMGV couples data mining tools with a user‐friendly web interface so that, with a few mouse clicks, one can identify the conditions that affect the expression of a gene or list of genes regulated in a set of experiments. One of the major new features we present here is a set of tools that allows for inter‐organism comparisons. This should enable the fission yeast community to take advantage of the large amount of available information on budding yeast transcriptome. New tools and ongoing developments are also presented here.
