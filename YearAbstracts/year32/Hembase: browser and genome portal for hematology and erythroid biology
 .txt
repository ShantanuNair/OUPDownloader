 Hembase ( http://hembase.niddk.nih.gov ) is an integrated browser and genome portal designed for web‐based examination of the human erythroid transcriptome. To date, Hembase contains 15 752 entries from erythroblast Expressed Sequenced Tags (ESTs) and 380 referenced genes relevant for erythropoiesis. The database is organized to provide a cytogenetic band position, a unique name as well as a concise annotation for each entry. Search queries may be performed by name, keyword or cytogenetic location. Search results are linked to primary sequence data and three major human genome browsers for access to information considered current at the time of each search. Hembase provides interested scientists and clinical hematologists with a genome‐based approach toward the study of erythroid biology.
