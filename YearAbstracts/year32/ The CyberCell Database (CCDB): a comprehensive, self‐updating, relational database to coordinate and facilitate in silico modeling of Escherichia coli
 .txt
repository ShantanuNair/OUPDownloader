 The CyberCell Database (CCDB: http://redpoll. pharmacy.ualberta.ca/CCDB ) is a comprehensive, web‐accessible database designed to support and coordinate international efforts in modeling an Escherichia coli cell on a computer. The CCDB brings together both observed and derived quantitative data from numerous independent sources covering many aspects of the genomic, proteomic and metabolomic character of E.coli (strain K12). The database is self‐updating but also supports ‘community’ annotation, and provides an extensive array of viewing, querying and search options including a powerful, easy‐to‐use relational data extraction system.
