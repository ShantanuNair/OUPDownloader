 NASC operates an Affymetrix ‘GeneChip’ (microarray) service for the Arabidopsis thaliana community. All data produced by the service are publicly available through our microarray data base ‘NASCArrays’ published at http://affymetrix. arabidopsis.info . The data are accessible through text searching and a series of data mining tools. All data are annotated with sample preparation details, and the original Affymetrix data are available for download. The database aims to be MIAME supportive and provide a coordinated resource for re searchers interested in the transcriptome of Arabidopsis . Using this database, data produced will be shared with other databases worldwide.
