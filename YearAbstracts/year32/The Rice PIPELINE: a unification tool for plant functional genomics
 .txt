 The Rice Genome Research Project in Japan performs genome sequencing and comprehensive expression profiling, constructs genetic and physical maps, collects full‐length cDNAs and generates mutant lines, all aimed at improving the breeding of the rice plant as a food source. The National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences in Tsukuba, Japan, has accumulated numerous rice biological resources and has already successfully produced a high‐quality genome sequence, a high‐density genetic map with 3000 markers, 30 000 full‐length cDNAs, over 700 expression profiles with a 9000 cDNA microarray and 15 000 flanking sequences with Tos17 insertions in about 3765 mutant lines from about 50 000 transposon insertion lines. These resources are available in the public domain. A new unification tool for functional genomics, called Rice PIPELINE, has also been developed for the dynamic collection and compilation of genomics data (genome sequences, full‐length cDNAs, gene expression profiles, mutant lines, cis elements) from various databases. The mission of Rice PIPELINE is to provide a unique scientific resource that pools publicly available rice genomic data for search by clone sequence, clone name, GenBank accession number, or keyword. The web‐based form of Rice PIPELINE is available at http://cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/PIPE/ .
