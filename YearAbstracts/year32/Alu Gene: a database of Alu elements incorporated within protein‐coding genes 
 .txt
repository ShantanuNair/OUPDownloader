Alu elements are short interspersed elements (SINEs) ∼300 nucleotides in length. More than 1 million Alu s are found in the human genome. Despite their being genetically functionless, recent findings suggest that Alu elements may have a broad evolutionary impact by affecting gene structures, protein sequences, splicing motifs and expression patterns. Because of these effects, compiling a genomic database of Alu sequences that reside within protein‐coding genes seemed a useful enterprise. Presently, such data are limited since the structural and positional information on genes and Alu sequences are scattered throughout incompatible and unconnected databases. Alu Gene ( http://Alugene.tau.ac.il/ ) provides easy access to a complete Alu map of the human genome, as well as Alu ‐associated information. The Alu elements are annotated with respect to coding region and exon/intron location. This design facilitates queries on Alu sequences, locations, as well as motifs and compositional properties via a one‐stop search page.
