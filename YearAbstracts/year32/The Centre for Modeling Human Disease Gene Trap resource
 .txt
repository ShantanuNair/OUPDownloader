 Gene trap mutagenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells generates random loss‐of‐function mutations, which can be identified by a sequence tag and can often report the endogenous expression of the mutated gene. The Centre for Modeling Human Disease is performing expression‐ and sequence‐based screens of gene trap insertions to generate new mouse mutations as a resource for the scientific community. The gene trap insertions are screened using multiplexed in vitro differentiation and induction assays, and sequence tags are generated to complement expression profiles. Researchers may search for insertions in genes expressed in target cell lineages, under specific in vitro conditions, or based upon sequence identity via an online searchable database ( http://www.cmhd.ca/sub/genetrap.asp ). The clones are available as a resource to researchers worldwide to help to functionally annotate the mammalian genome and will serve as a source to test candidate loci identified by phenotype‐driven mutagenesis screens.
