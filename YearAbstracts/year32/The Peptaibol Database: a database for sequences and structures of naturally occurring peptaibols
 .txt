 The Peptaibol Database is a sequence and structure resource for the unusual class of peptides known as peptaibols. These peptides exhibit antibiotic and membrane channel‚Äêforming activities. The database includes sequence, biological source and bibliographical data for the naturally occurring peptaibols. Information is also collated for the growing number of peptaibol 3D structures determined by either crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. The database can be obtained as a whole or can be queried by name, group, sequence motif, biological origin and/or literature reference. The Peptaibol Database can be freely accessed at http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/peptaibol .
