 The analysis of regulatory regions in genome sequences is strongly based on the detection of potential transcription factor binding sites. The preferred models for representation of transcription factor binding specificity have been termed position‐specific scoring matrices. JASPAR is an open‐access database of annotated, high‐quality, matrix‐based transcription factor binding site profiles for multicellular eukaryotes. The profiles were derived exclusively from sets of nucleotide sequences experimentally demonstrated to bind transcription factors. The database is complemented by a web interface for browsing, searching and subset selection, an online sequence analysis utility and a suite of programming tools for genome‐wide and comparative genomic analysis of regulatory regions. JASPAR is available at http://jaspar. cgb.ki.se .
