 We have built a protein subcellular localization annotation database, the DBSubLoc database, which is available at http://www.bioinfo.tsinghua. edu.cn/dbsubloc.html . Annotations were taken from primary protein databases, model organism genome projects and literature texts, and then were analyzed to dig out the subcellular localization features of the proteins. The proteins are also classified into different categories. Based on sequence alignment, non‐redundant subsets of the database have been built, which may provide useful information for subcellular localization prediction. The database now contains >60 000 protein sequences including ∼30 000 protein sequences in the non‐redundant data sets. Online download, search and Blast tools are also available.
