We previously introduced two new protein databases (trEST and trGEN) of hypothetical protein sequences predicted from EST and HTG sequences, respectively. Here, we present the updates made on these two databases plus a new database (trome), which uses alignments of EST data to HTG or full genomes to generate virtual transcripts and coding sequences. This new database is of higher quality and since it contains the information in a much denser format it is of much smaller size. These new databases are in a Swiss‐Prot‐like format and are updated on a weekly basis (trEST and trGEN) or every 3 months (trome). They can be downloaded by anonymous ftp from ftp://ftp.isrec.isb‐sib.ch/pub/databases.
