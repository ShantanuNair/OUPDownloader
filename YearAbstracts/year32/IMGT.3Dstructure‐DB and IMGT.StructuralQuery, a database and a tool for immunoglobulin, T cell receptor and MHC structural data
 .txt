 IMGT/3Dstructure‐DB and IMGT/Structural‐Query are a novel 3D structure database and a new tool for immunological proteins. They are part of IMGT, the international ImMunoGenetics information system®, a high‐quality integrated knowledge resource specializing in immunoglobulins (IG), T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of human and other vertebrate species, which consists of databases, Web resources and interactive on‐line tools. IMGT/3Dstructure‐DB data are described according to the IMGT Scientific chart rules based on the IMGT‐ONTOLOGY concepts. IMGT/3Dstructure‐DB provides IMGT gene and allele identification of IG, TR and MHC proteins with known 3D structures, domain delimitations, amino acid positions according to the IMGT unique numbering and renumbered coordinate flat files. Moreover IMGT/3Dstructure‐DB provides 2D graphical representations (or Collier de Perles) and results of contact analysis. The IMGT/StructuralQuery tool allows search of this database based on specific structural characteristics. IMGT/3Dstructure‐DB and IMGT/StructuralQuery are freely available at http://imgt. cines.fr .
