 The aim of the MitoP2 database ( http://ihg.gsf.de/mitop2 ) is to provide a comprehensive list of mitochondrial proteins of yeast and man. Based on the current literature we created an annotated reference set of yeast and human proteins. In addition, data sets relevant to the study of the mitochondrial proteome are integrated and accessible via search tools and links. They include computational predictions of signalling sequences, and summarize results from proteome mapping, mutant screening, expression profiling, proteinâ€“protein interaction and cellular sublocalization studies. For each individual approach, specificity and sensitivity for allocating mitochondrial proteins was calculated. By providing the evidence for mitochondrial candidate proteins the MitoP2 database lends itself to the genetic characterization of human mitochondriopathies.
