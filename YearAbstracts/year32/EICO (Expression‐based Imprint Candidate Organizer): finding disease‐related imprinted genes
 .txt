 We have developed an integrated database that is specialized for the study of imprinted disease genes. The database contains novel candidate imprinted genes identified by the RIKEN full‐length mouse cDNA microarray study, information on validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to confirm imprinting using reciprocal mouse crosses and the predicted physical position of imprinting‐related disease loci in the mouse and human genomes. It has two user‐friendly search interfaces: the SNP‐central view (MuSCAT: MoUse SNP CATalog) and the candidate gene‐central view (CITE: Candidate Imprinted Transcripts by Expression). The database, EICO (Expression‐based Imprint Candidate Organizer), can be accessed via the World Wide Web ( http://fantom2.gsc.riken.jp/EICODB/ ) and the DAS client software. These data and interfaces facilitate understanding of the mechanism of imprinting in mammalian inherited traits.
