 To provide the scientific community with a single, centralized, authoritative resource for protein sequences and functional information, the Swiss‐Prot, TrEMBL and PIR protein database activities have united to form the Universal Protein Knowledgebase (UniProt) consortium. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase, with extensive cross‐references and query interfaces. The central database will have two sections, corresponding to the familiar Swiss‐Prot (fully manually curated entries) and TrEMBL (enriched with automated classification, annotation and extensive cross‐references). For convenient sequence searches, UniProt also provides several non‐redundant sequence databases. The UniProt NREF (UniRef) databases provide representative subsets of the knowledgebase suitable for efficient searching. The comprehensive UniProt Archive (UniParc) is updated daily from many public source databases. The UniProt databases can be accessed online ( http://www.uniprot.org ) or downloaded in several formats (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub). The scientific community is encouraged to submit data for inclusion in UniProt.
