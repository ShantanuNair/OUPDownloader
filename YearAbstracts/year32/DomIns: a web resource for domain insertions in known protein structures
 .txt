 Proteins can be formed by single or multiple domains. The process of recombination at the molecular level has generated a wide variety of multi‐domain proteins with specific domain organization to cater to the functional requirements of an organism. The functional and structural costs of inserting a domain into another means that multi‐domain proteins are usually formed by covalently linking the N‐terminus of one domain to the C‐terminus of the preceding domain. While this is true in a large proportion of multi‐domain proteins, we find a significant fraction of proteins that are the result of domain insertion. The inserted domain breaks the sequence contiguity of the domain into which it is inserted leading to a novel domain organization. This web resource aims to document domain insertions in known protein structures that are classified in the SCOP database.
