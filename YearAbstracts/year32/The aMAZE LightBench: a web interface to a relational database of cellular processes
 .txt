 The aMAZE LightBench ( http://www.amaze.ulb. ac.be/ ) is a web interface to the aMAZE relational database, which contains information on gene expression, catalysed chemical reactions, regulatory interactions, protein assembly, as well as metabolic and signal transduction pathways. It allows the user to browse the information in an intuitive way, which also reflects the underlying data model. Moreover links are provided to literature references, and whenever appropriate, to external databases.
