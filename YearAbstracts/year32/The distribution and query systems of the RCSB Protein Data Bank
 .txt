 The Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.pdb.org ) is the primary source of information on the 3D structure of biological macromolecules. The PDB’s mandate is to disseminate this information in the most usable form and as widely as possible. The current query and distribution system is described and an alpha version of the future re‐engineered system introduced.
