 The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; http://www.yeastgenome.org/ ), a scientific database of the molecular biology and genetics of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , has recently developed several new resources that allow the comparison and integration of information on a genome‐wide scale, enabling the user not only to find detailed information about individual genes, but also to make connections across groups of genes with common features and across different species. The Fungal Alignment Viewer displays alignments of sequences from multiple fungal genomes, while the Sequence Similarity Query tool displays PSI‐BLAST alignments of each S.cerevisiae protein with similar proteins from any species whose sequences are contained in the non‐redundant (nr) protein data set at NCBI. The Yeast Biochemical Pathways tool integrates groups of genes by their common roles in metabolism and displays the metabolic pathways in a graphical form. Finally, the Find Chromosomal Features search interface provides a versatile tool for querying multiple types of information in SGD.
