 The Database of Interacting Proteins ( http://dip.doe‐mbi.ucla.edu ) aims to integrate the diverse body of experimental evidence on protein–protein interactions into a single, easily accessible online database. Because the reliability of experimental evidence varies widely, methods of quality assessment have been developed and utilized to identify the most reliable subset of the interactions. This CORE set can be used as a reference when evaluating the reliability of high‐throughput protein–protein interaction data sets, for development of prediction methods, as well as in the studies of the properties of protein interaction networks.
