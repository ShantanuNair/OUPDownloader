 CryptoDB ( http://CryptoDB.org ) represents a collaborative effort to locate all genome data for the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum in a single user‐friendly database. CryptoDB currently houses the genomic sequence data for both the human type 1 H strain and the bovine type 2 IOWA strain in addition to all other available EST and GSS sequences obtained from public repositories. All data are available for data mining via BLAST, keyword searches of pre‐computed BLASTX results and user‐defined or PROSITE motif pattern searches. Release 1.0 of CryptoDB contains ∼19 million bases of genome sequence for the H and IOWA strains and an additional ∼24 million bases of GSS and EST sequence obtained from other sources. Open reading frames greater than 50 and 100 amino acids have been generated for all sequences and all data are available for bulk download. This database, like other apicomplexan parasite databases, has been built utilizing the PlasmoDB model.
