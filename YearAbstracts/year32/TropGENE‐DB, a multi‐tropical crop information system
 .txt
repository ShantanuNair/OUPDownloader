 TropGENE‐DB, is a crop information system created to store genetic, molecular and phenotypic data of the numerous yet poorly documented tropical crop species. The most common data stored in TropGENE‐DB are information on genetic resources (agro‐morphological data, parentages, allelic diversity), molecular markers, genetic maps, results of quantitative trait loci analyses, data from physical mapping, sequences, genes, as well as the corresponding references. TropGENE‐DB is organized on a crop basis with currently three running modules (sugarcane, cocoa and banana), with plans to create additional modules for rice, cotton, oil palm, coconut, rubber tree, pineapple, taro, yam and sorghum. The TropGENE‐DB information system is accessible for consultation via the internet at http://tropgenedb.cirad.fr . Specific web consultation interfaces have been designed to allow quick consultations as well as complex queries.
