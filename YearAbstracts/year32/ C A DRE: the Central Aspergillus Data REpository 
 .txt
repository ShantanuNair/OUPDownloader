 C A DRE is a public resource for housing and analysing genomic data extracted from species of Aspergillus . It arose to enable maintenance of the complete annotated genomic sequence of Aspergillus fumigatus and to provide tools for searching, analysing and visualizing features of fungal genomes. By implementing C A DRE using Ensembl, a framework is in place for storing and comparing several genomes: the resource will thus expand by including other Aspergillus genomes (such as Aspergillus nidulans ) as they become available. C A DRE is accessible at http://www.cadre. man.ac.uk .
