Metabolic capabilities of microorganisms include the production of secondary metabolites (e.g. antibiotics). The analysis of microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) is an emerging research field with huge impact on medical, agricultural and biotechnical applied and basic science. The mVOC database (v1) has grown with microbiome research and integrated species information with data on emitted volatiles. Here, we present the mVOC 2.0 database with about 2000 compounds from almost 1000 species and new features to work with the database. The extended collection of compounds was augmented with data regarding mVOC-mediated effects on plants, fungi, bacteria and (in-)vertebrates. The mVOC database 2.0 now features a mass spectrum finder, which allows a quick mass spectrum comparison for compound identification and the generation of species-specific VOC signatures. Automatic updates, useful links and search for mVOC literature are also included. The mVOC database aggregates and refines available information regarding microbial volatiles, with the ultimate aim to provide a comprehensive and informative platform for scientists working in this research field. To address this need, we maintain a publicly available mVOC database at: http://bioinformatics.charite.de/mvoc.
