A complete knowledge of the proteome can only be attained by determining the associations between proteins, along with the nature of these associations (e.g. physical contact in proteinâ€“protein interactions, participation in complex formation or different roles in the same pathway). Despite extensive efforts in elucidating direct protein interactions, our knowledge on the complete spectrum of protein associations remains limited. We therefore developed a new approach that detects protein associations from identifications obtained after re-processing of large-scale, public mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. Our approach infers protein association based on the co-occurrence of proteins across many different proteomics experiments, and provides information that is almost completely complementary to traditional direct protein interaction studies. We here present a web interface to query and explore the associations derived from this method, called the online Tabloid Proteome. The online Tabloid Proteome also integrates biological knowledge from several existing resources to annotate our derived protein associations. The online Tabloid Proteome is freely available through a user-friendly web interface, which provides intuitive navigation and data exploration options for the user at http://iomics.ugent.be/tabloidproteome.
