Core transcription regulatory circuitry (CRC) is comprised of a small group of self-regulated transcription factors (TFs) and their interconnected regulatory loops. Studies from embryonic stem cells and other cellular models have revealed the elementary roles of CRCs in transcriptional control of cell identity and cellular fate. Systematic identification and subsequent archiving of CRCs across diverse cell types and tissues are needed to explore both cell/tissue type-specific and disease-associated transcriptional networks. Here, we present a comprehensive and interactive database (dbCoRC, http://dbcorc.cam-su.org) of CRC models which are computationally inferred from mapping of super-enhancer and prediction of TF binding sites. The current version of dbCoRC contains CRC models for 188 human and 50 murine cell lines/tissue samples. In companion with CRC models, this database also provides: (i) super enhancer, typical enhancer, and H3K27ac landscape for individual samples, (ii) putative binding sites of each core TF across the super-enhancer regions within CRC and (iii) expression of each core TF in normal or cancer cells/tissues. The dbCoRC will serve as a valuable resource for the scientific community to explore transcriptional control and regulatory circuitries in biological processes related to, but not limited to lineage specification, tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis.
