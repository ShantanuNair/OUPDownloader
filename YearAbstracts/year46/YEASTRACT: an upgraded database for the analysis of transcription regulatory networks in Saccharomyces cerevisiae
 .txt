The YEAst Search for Transcriptional Regulators And Consensus Tracking (YEASTRACTâ€”www.yeastract.com) information system has been, for 11 years, a key tool for the analysis and prediction of transcription regulatory associations at the gene and genomic levels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Since its last update in June 2017, YEASTRACT includes approximately 163000 regulatory associations between transcription factors (TF) and target genes in S. cerevisiae, based on more than 1600 bibliographic references; it also includes 247 specific DNA binding consensus recognized by 113 TFs. This release of the YEASTRACT database provides new visualization tools to visualize each regulatory network in an interactive fashion, enabling the user to select and observe subsets of the network such as: (i) considering only DNA binding evidence or both DNA binding and expression evidence; (ii) considering only either positive or negative regulatory associations; or (iii) considering only one set of related environmental conditions. A further tool to observe TF regulons is also offered, enabling a clear-cut understanding of the exact meaning of the available data. We believe that with this new version, YEASTRACT will improve its role as an open web resource instrumental for Yeast Biologists and Systems Biology researchers.
