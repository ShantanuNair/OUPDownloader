Minimotif Miner (MnM) is a database and web system for analyzing short functional peptide motifs, termed minimotifs. We present an update to MnM growing the database from âˆ¼300 000 to >1 000 000 minimotif consensus sequences and instances. This growth comes largely from updating data from existing databases and annotation of articles with high-throughput approaches analyzing different types of post-translational modifications. Another update is mapping human proteins and their minimotifs to know human variants from the dbSNP, build 150. Now MnM 4 can be used to generate mechanistic hypotheses about how human genetic variation affect minimotifs and outcomes. One example of the utility of the combined minimotif/SNP tool identifies a loss of function missense SNP in a ubiquitylation minimotif encoded in the excision repair cross-complementing 2 (ERCC2) nucleotide excision repair gene. This SNP reaches genome wide significance for many types of cancer and the variant identified with MnM 4 reveals a more detailed mechanistic hypothesis concerning the role of ERCC2 in cancer. Other updates to the web system include a new architecture with migration of the web system and database to Docker containers for better performance and management.
