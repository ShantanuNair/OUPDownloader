For 35 years the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) has been responsible for making the worldâ€™s public sequencing data available to the scientific community. Advances in sequencing technology have driven exponential growth in the volume of data to be processed and stored and a substantial broadening of the user community. Here, we outline ENA services and content in 2017 and provide insight into a selection of current key areas of development in ENA driven by challenges arising from the above growth.
