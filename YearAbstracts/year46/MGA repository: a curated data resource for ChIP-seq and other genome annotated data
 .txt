The Mass Genome Annotation (MGA) repository is a resource designed to store published next generation sequencing data and other genome annotation data (such as gene start sites, SNPs, etc.) in a completely standardised format. Each sample has undergone local processing in order the meet the strict MGA format requirements. The original data source, the reformatting procedure and the biological characteristics of the samples are described in an accompanying documentation file manually edited by data curators. 10 model organisms are currently represented: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, Apis mellifera, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. As of today, the resource contains over 24 000 samples. In conjunction with other tools developed by our group (the ChIP-Seq and SSA servers), it allows users to carry out a great variety of analysis task with MGA samples, such as making aggregation plots and heat maps for selected genomic regions, finding peak regions, generating custom tracks for visualizing genomic features in a UCSC genome browser window, or downloading chromatin data in a table format suitable for local processing with more advanced statistical analysis software such as R.
