The database of multiple alignments for protein structures (DMAPS) provides instant access to pre-computed multiple structure alignments for all protein structure families in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Protein structure families have been obtained from four distinct classification methods including SCOP, CATH, ENZYME and CE, and multiple structure alignments have been built for all families containing at least three members, using CE-MC software. Currently, multiple structure alignments are available for 3050 SCOP-, 3087 CATH-, 664 ENZYME- and 1707 CE-based families. A web-based query system has been developed to retrieve multiple alignments for these families using the PDB chain ID of any member of a family. Multiple alignments can be viewed or downloaded in six different formats, including JOY/html, TEXT, FASTA, PDB (superimposed coordinates), JOY/postscript and JOY/rtf. DMAPS is accessible online at http://bioinformatics.albany.edu/~dmaps.
