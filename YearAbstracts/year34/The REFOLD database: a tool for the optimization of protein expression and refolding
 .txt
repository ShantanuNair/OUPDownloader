A large proportion of proteins expressed in Escherichia coli form inclusion bodies and thus require renaturation to attain a functional conformation for analysis. In this process, identifying and optimizing the refolding conditions and methodology is often rate limiting. In order to address this problem, we have developed REFOLD, a web-accessible relational database containing the published methods employed in the refolding of recombinant proteins. Currently, REFOLD contains >300 entries, which are heavily annotated such that the database can be searched via multiple parameters. We anticipate that REFOLD will continue to grow and eventually become a powerful tool for the optimization of protein renaturation. REFOLD is freely available at http://refold.med.monash.edu.au.
