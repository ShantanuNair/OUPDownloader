Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been the most actively employed targets in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of human carcinoma, such as PSA in the diagnosis of prostate cancer and NY-ESO-1 in the immunotherapy of melanoma and other cancers. However, identification of TAAs has often been hampered by the complicated and laborsome laboratory procedures. In order to accelerate the process of tumor antigen discovery, and thereby improve diagnosis and treatment of human carcinoma, we have made an effort to establish a publicly available Human Potential Tumor Associated Antigen database (HPtaa) with potential TAAs identified by in silico computing (http://www.hptaa.org). Tumor specificity was chosen as the core of tumor antigen evaluation, together with other relevant clues. Various platforms of gene expression, including microarray, expressed sequence tag and SAGE data, were processed and integrated by several penalty algorithms. A total of 3518 potential TAAs have been included in the database, which is freely available to academic users. As far as we know, this database is the first one addressing human potential TAAs, and the first one integrating various kinds of expression platforms for one purpose.
