Serving as a community resource, Panzea (http://www.panzea.org) is the bioinformatics arm of the Molecular and Functional Diversity in the Maize Genome project. Maize, a classical model for genetic studies, is an important crop species and also the most diverse crop species known. On average, two randomly chosen maize lines have one single-nucleotide polymorphism every ∼100 bp; this divergence is roughly equivalent to the differences between humans and chimpanzees. This exceptional genotypic diversity underlies the phenotypic diversity maize needs to be cultivated in a wide range of environments. The Molecular and Functional Diversity in the Maize Genome project aims to understand how selection has shaped molecular diversity in maize and then relate molecular diversity to functional phenotypic variation. The project will screen 4000 loci for the signature of selection and create a wide range of maize and maize–teosinte mapping populations. These populations will be genotyped and phenotyped, permitting high-power and high-resolution dissection of the traits and relating the molecular diversity to functional variation. Panzea provides access to the genotype, phenotype and polymorphism data produced by the project through user-friendly web-based database searches and data retrieval/visualization tools, as well as a wide variety of information and services related to maize diversity.
