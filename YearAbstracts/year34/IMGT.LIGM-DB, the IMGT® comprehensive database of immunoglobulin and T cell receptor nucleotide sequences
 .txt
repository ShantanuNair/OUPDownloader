IMGT/LIGM-DB is the IMGT® comprehensive database of immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) nucleotide sequences from human and other vertebrate species. It was created in 1989 by LIGM, Montpellier, France and is the oldest and the largest database of IMGT®. IMGT/LIGM-DB includes all germline (non-rearranged) and rearranged IG and TR genomic DNA (gDNA) and complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences published in generalist databases. IMGT/LIGM-DB allows searches from the Web interface according to biological and immunogenetic criteria through five distinct modules depending on the user interest. For a given entry, nine types of display are available including the IMGT flat file, the translation of the coding regions and the analysis by the IMGT/V-QUEST tool. IMGT/LIGM-DB distributes expertly annotated sequences. The annotations hugely enhance the quality and the accuracy of the distributed detailed information. They include the sequence identification, the gene and allele classification, the constitutive and specific motif description, the codon and amino acid numbering, and the sequence obtaining information, according to the main concepts of IMGT-ONTOLOGY. They represent the main source of IG and TR gene and allele knowledge stored in IMGT/GENE-DB and in the IMGT reference directory. IMGT/LIGM-DB is freely available at http://imgt.cines.fr.
