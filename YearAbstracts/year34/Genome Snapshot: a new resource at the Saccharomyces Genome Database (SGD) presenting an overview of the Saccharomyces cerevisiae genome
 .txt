Sequencing and annotation of the entire Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome has made it possible to gain a genome-wide perspective on yeast genes and gene products. To make this information available on an ongoing basis, the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) (http://www.yeastgenome.org/) has created the Genome Snapshot (http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/genomeSnapShot.pl). The Genome Snapshot summarizes the current state of knowledge about the genes and chromosomal features of S.cerevisiae. The information is organized into two categories: (i) number of each type of chromosomal feature annotated in the genome and (ii) number and distribution of genes annotated to Gene Ontology terms. Detailed lists are accessible through SGD's Advanced Search tool (http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/search/featureSearch), and all the data presented on this page are available from the SGD ftp site (ftp://ftp.yeastgenome.org/yeast/).
