Prokaryotic genomic DNA is generally negatively supercoiled in vivo. Many regulatory processes, including the initiation of transcription, are known to depend on the superhelical state of the DNA substrate. The stresses induced within DNA by negative superhelicity can destabilize the DNA duplex at specific sites. Various experiments have either shown or suggested that stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) is involved in specific regulatory mechanisms governing a variety of biological processes. We have developed methods to evaluate the SIDD properties of DNA sequences, including complete chromosomes. This analysis predicts the locations where the duplex becomes destabilized under superhelical stress. Previous studies have shown that the SIDD-susceptible sites predicted in this way occur at rates much higher than expected at random in transcriptional regulatory regions, and much lower than expected in coding regions. Analysis of the SIDD profiles of 42 bacterial genomes chosen for their diversity confirms this pattern. Predictions of SIDD sites have been used to identify potential genomic regulatory regions, and suggest both possible regulatory mechanisms involving stress-induced destabilization and experimental tests of these mechanisms. Here we describe the SIDDBASE database which enables users to retrieve and visualize the results of SIDD analyses of completely sequenced prokaryotic and archaeal genomes, together with their annotations.
