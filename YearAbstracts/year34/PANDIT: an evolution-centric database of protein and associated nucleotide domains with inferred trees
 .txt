PANDIT is a database of homologous sequence alignments accompanied by estimates of their corresponding phylogenetic trees. It provides a valuable resource to those studying phylogenetic methodology and the evolution of coding-DNA and protein sequences. Currently in version 17.0, PANDIT comprises 7738 families of homologous protein domains; for each family, DNA and corresponding amino acid sequence multiple alignments are available together with high quality phylogenetic tree estimates. Recent improvements include expanded methods for phylogenetic tree inference, assessment of alignment quality and a redesigned web interface, available at the URL http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/pandit.
