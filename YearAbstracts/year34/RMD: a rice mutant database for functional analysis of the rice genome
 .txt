Rice Mutant Database (RMD, http://rmd.ncpgr.cn) is an archive for collecting, managing and searching information of the T-DNA insertion mutants generated by an enhancer trap system. We have generated ∼129 000 rice mutant (enhancer trap) lines that are now being gathered in the database. Information collected in RMD includes mutant phenotypes, reporter-gene expression patterns, flanking sequences of T-DNA insertional sites, seed availability and others, and can be searched by respective ID, keyword, nucleotide sequence or protein sequence on the website. This database is both a mutant collection for identifying novel genes and regulatory elements and a pattern line collection for ectopic expression of target gene in specific tissue or at specific growth stage.
