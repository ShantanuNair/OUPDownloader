The SGCEdb (http://sgce.cbse.uab.edu) database/interface serves the primary purpose of reporting progress of the Structural Genomics of Caenorhabditis elegans project at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. It stores and analyzes results of experiments ranging from solubility screening arrays to individual protein purification and structure solution. External databases and algorithms are referenced and evaluated for target selection in the human, C.elegans and Pneumocystis carinii genomes. The flexible and reusable design permits tracking of standard and custom experiment types in a scientist-defined sequence. The database coordinates efforts between collaborators and is adaptable to a wide range of biological applications.
