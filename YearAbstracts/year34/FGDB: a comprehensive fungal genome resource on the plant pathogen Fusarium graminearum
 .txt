The MIPS Fusarium graminearum Genome Database (FGDB) is a comprehensive genome database on one of the most devastating fungal plant pathogens of wheat and barley. FGDB provides information on two gene sets independently derived by automated annotation of the F.graminearum genome sequence. A complete manually revised gene set will be completed within the near future. The initial results of systematic manual correction of gene calls are already part of the current gene set. The database can be accessed to retrieve information from bioinformatics analyses and functional classifications of the proteins. The data are also organized in the well established MIPS catalogs and novel query techniques are available to search the data. The comprehensive set of gene calls was also used for the design of an Affymetrix GeneChip. The resource is accessible on http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/fusarium/.
