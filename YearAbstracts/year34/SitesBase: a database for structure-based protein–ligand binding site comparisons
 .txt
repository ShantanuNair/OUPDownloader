There are many components which govern the function of a protein within a cell. Here, we focus on the molecular recognition of small molecules and the prediction of common recognition by similarity between protein–ligand binding sites. SitesBase is an easily accessible database which is simple to use and holds information about structural similarities between known ligand binding sites found in the Protein Data Bank. These similarities are presented to the wider community enabling full analysis of molecular recognition and potentially protein structure–function relationships. SitesBase is accessible at http://www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/sb.
