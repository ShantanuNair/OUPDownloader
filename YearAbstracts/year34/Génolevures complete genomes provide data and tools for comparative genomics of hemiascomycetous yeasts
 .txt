The Génolevures online database (http://cbi.labri.fr/Genolevures/) provides tools and data relative to 4 complete and 10 partial genome sequences determined and manually annotated by the Génolevures Consortium, to facilitate comparative genomic studies of hemiascomycetous yeasts. With their relatively small and compact genomes, yeasts offer a unique opportunity for exploring eukaryotic genome evolution. The new version of the Génolevures database provides truly complete (subtelomere to subtelomere) chromosome sequences, 25 000 protein-coding and tRNA genes, and in silico analyses for each gene element. A new feature of the database is a novel collection of conserved multi-species protein families and their mapping to metabolic pathways, coupled with an advanced search feature. Data are presented with a focus on relations between genes and genomes: conservation of genes and gene families, speciation, chromosomal reorganization and synteny. The Génolevures site includes an area for specific studies by members of its international community.
