We have developed Mammalian Promoter Database (MPromDb), a novel database that integrates gene promoters with experimentally supported annotation of transcription start sites, cis-regulatory elements, CpG islands and chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-chip) experimental results with intuitively designed presentation. Release 1.0 of MPromDb currently contains 36 407 promoters and first exons (19 170 from human, 15 953 from mouse and 1284 from rat), 3739 transcription factor (TF)-binding sites (2027 from human, 1181 mouse and 531 rat) and 224 TFs with links to PubMed and GenBank references. Target promoters of TFs that have been identified by ChIP-chip assay are integrated into the database. MPromDb serves as a portal for genome-wide promoter analysis of data generated by ChIP-chip experimental studies. MPromDb can be accessed from http://bioinformatics.med.ohio-state.edu/MPromDb.
