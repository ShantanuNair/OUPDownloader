For this reason we developed UTRdb (http://bigarea.area.ba.cnr.it:8000/Biowww/#UTRdb), a specialized database of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs cleaned from redundancy. UTRdb entries are enriched with specialized information not present in the primary databases including the presence of nucleotide sequence patterns already demonstrated by experimental analysis to have some functional role. All these patterns have been collected in the UTRsite database so that it is possible to search any input sequence for the presence of annotated functional motifs. Furthermore, UTRdb entries have been annotated for the presence of repetitive elements.", "authors": ["Graziano Pesole", "Sabino Liuni", "Giorgio Grillo", "Matilde Ippedico", "Alessandra Larizza", "Wojciech Makalowski", "Cecilia Saccone"], "about": ["base sequence", "gene expression regulation", "rna, messenger", "untranslated regions", "redundancy", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "UTRdb: a specialized database of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs\r\n "}
