HuGeMap is accessible on the Web at http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/Hugemap and through a CORBA server. A standard genome map data format for the interconnection of genome map databases was defined in collaboration with the EBI. The HuGeMap CORBA server provides this interconnection using the interface definition language IDL. Two graphical user interfaces were developed for the visualization of the HuGeMap data: ZoomMap (http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/zomit/ZoomMap.html) for navigation by zooming and data transformation via magic lenses, and Mappet-Show (http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/Mappet) for visualizing and comparing maps.", "authors": ["Emmanuel Barillot", "Stuart Pook", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guyon", "Christophe Cussat-Blanc", "\u00c9ric Viara", "Guy Vaysseix"], "about": ["genome", "genome, human", "languages", "lens, crystalline", "lens (device)", "genetics", "maps", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The HuGeMap Database: interconnection and visualization of human genome maps\r\n "}
