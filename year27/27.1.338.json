{"keywords": ["clone cells", "dna, complementary", "genes", "internet"], "abstract": "HUGE is a database for human large proteins newly identified by Kazusa cDNA project, which aims to predict protein primary structures from sequences of human large cDNAs (>4 kb). In particular, cDNA clones capable of coding for large proteins (>50 kDa) are current targets of the project. More than 700 sequences of human cDNAs (average size, 5.1 kb) have been determined to date and deposited in the public databases. Notable information implied from the cDNAs and the predicted protein sequences can be obtained through HUGE via the World Wide Web at URL http://www.kazusa.or.jp/huge", "authors": ["Mikita Suyama", "Takahiro Nagase", "Osamu Ohara"], "about": ["clone cells", "dna, complementary", "genes", "internet", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "HUGE: a database for human large proteins identified by Kazusa cDNA sequencing project\r\n "}
