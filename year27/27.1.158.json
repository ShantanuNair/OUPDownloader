This edition of the data bank contains 1889 primary structures of 5S rRNA and 5S rDNA. These include 60 archaebacterial, 439 eubacterial, 63 plastid, 9 mitochondrial and 1318 eukaryotic sequences. The nucleotide sequences of 5S rRNAs or 5S rDNAs are divided according to the taxonomic position of organisms. The sequences stored in the database can be viewed and retrieved using the taxonomic browser at the URL: http://rose.man.poznan.pl/5SData/5SRNA.html", "authors": ["Maciej Szymanski", "Miroslawa Z.
