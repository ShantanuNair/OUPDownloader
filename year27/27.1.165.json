The tmRNA website was established in 1997 as a resource for phylogenetic considerations of tmRNA structure and function. Since then, three partial tmRNA sequences have been completed, and sequences from 13 more species have been identified. Forty-six species from 10 bacterial phyla and chloroplasts are now represented in the database. Provisional sequence alignments and predicted proteolysis tag sequences are provided, as well as a literature review and a guide to searching for new tmRNA sequences.
