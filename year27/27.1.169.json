{"keywords": ["amino acids", "nucleotides", "protein structure, secondary", "signal recognition particle", "rna"], "abstract": "The signal recognition particle database (SRPDB) is located at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler and includes tabulations of SRP RNA, SRP protein and SRP receptor sequences. The sequences are annotated with links to the primary databases. They are ordered alphabetically or phylogenetically and are available in aligned form. As of September, 1998, there were 108 SRP RNA sequences, 83 SRP protein sequences and 28 sequences of the SRP receptor \u03b1 subunit and its homologues. In addition, the SRPDB provides search motifs consisting of conserved amino acid and nucleotide residues, and a limited number of SRP RNA secondary structure diagrams and 3-D models. the data are available freely at the URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html", "authors": ["Tore Samuelsson", "Christian Zwieb"], "about": ["amino acids", "nucleotides", "protein structure, secondary", "signal recognition particle", "rna", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB)\r\n "}
