GXD is implemented as a relational database and integrated with the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) to enable global analysis of genotype, expression and phenotype information. Interconnections with sequence databases and with databases from other species further extend GXD's utility for the analysis of gene expression data. GXD is available through the Mouse Genome Informatics Web Site at http://www.informatics.jax.org/", "authors": ["Martin Ringwald", "Mary E. Mangan", "Janan T. Eppig", "James A. Kadin", "Joel E.
