{"keywords": ["mutation", "amino acids", "genome"], "abstract": "AAindex is a database of numerical indices representing various physicochemical and biochemical properties of amino acids and pairs of amino acids. It consists of two sections: AAindex1 for the amino acid index of 20 numerical values and AAindex2 for the amino acid mutation matrix of 210 numerical values. Each entry of either AAindex1 or AAindex2 consists of the definition, the reference information, a list of related entries in terms of the correlation coefficient, and the actual data. The database may be accessed through the DBGET/LinkDB system at GenomeNet (http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget/) or may be downloaded by anonymous FTP (ftp://ftp.genome.ad.jp/db/genomenet/aaindex/).", "authors": ["Shuichi Kawashima", "Hiroyuki Ogata", "Minoru Kanehisa"], "about": ["mutation", "amino acids", "genome", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "AAindex: Amino Acid Index Database\r\n "}
