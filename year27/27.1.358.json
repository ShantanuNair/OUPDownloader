This KMeyeDB employs a database software MutationView which provides graphical data presentation and analysis as a smooth user-interface. Currently, the KMeyeDB contains mutation data of 16 different genes for 18 eye diseases. The KMeyeDB is accessible through http://mutview.dmb.med.keio.ac.jp with advanced internet browsers.", "authors": ["Shinsei Minoshima", "Susumu Mitsuyama", "Saho Ohno", "Takashi Kawamura", "Nobuyoshi Shimizu"], "about": ["mutation", "eye diseases", "genes", "internet", "software", "user-computer interface", "3,3-dimethylbutan-1-ol", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Keio Mutation Database for eye disease genes (KMeyeDB)\r\n "}
