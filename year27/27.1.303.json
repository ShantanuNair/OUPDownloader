In addition, the new TRRD release provides considerably more references to other molecular biological databases. TRRD 4.1 is installed under srs and is available through the www at http://www.bionet.nsc.ru/trrd/", "authors": ["N. A. Kolchanov", "E. A. Ananko", "O. A. Podkolodnaya", "E. V. Ignatieva", "I. L.
