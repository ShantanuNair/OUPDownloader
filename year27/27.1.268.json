ISSD serves as an integrated source of sequence and structure information for the analysis of correlations between mRNA synonymous codon usage and threedimensional structure of the encoded proteins. ISSD now holds 88 non-homologous Escherichia coli proteins and 25 yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins in addition to the expanded set of mammalian proteins, which includes 166 proteins (107 in ISSD Version 1.0). Comparison of ISSD sequences with organism-specific codon usage data derived from CUTG database shows that it is a representative subset of the genbank coding sequences data. Preliminary results of the statistical analysis confirm that sequence-structure correlations observed by us earlier are also present in the upgraded ISSD (Version 2.0), including bacterial and yeast proteins. The ISSD version 2.0 release includes an improved web-based data search and retrieval system and is accessible via URL http://www.protein.bio.msu.su/issd/. ISSD can be also accessed at ExPASy, URL http://www.expasy.ch/swissmod/swiss-model.html", "authors": ["Ivan A. Adzhubei", "Alexei A.
