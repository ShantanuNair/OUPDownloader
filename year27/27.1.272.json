{"keywords": ["genome", "information storage and retrieval", "family relationship"], "abstract": "Proclass is a protein family database that organizes non-redundant sequence entries into families defined collectively by prosite patterns and pir superfamilies. By combining global similarities and functional motifs into a single classification scheme, proclass helps to reveal domain and family relationships and classify multi-domain proteins. The database currently consists of more than 120 000 sequence entries, \u223c60% of which is classified into about 3500 families. To maximize family information retrieval, the database provides links to various protein family/ domain and structural class databases and contains multiple motif alignments of all prosite patterns as well as global alignments of pir superfamilies. The motif sequences are retrieved from both pir-international and swiss-prot databases, including a large number of new members detected by our genefind family identification system. Proclass can be used to support full-scale genomic annotation, because of its high classification rate. The proclass database is available for on-line search and record retrieval from our www server at http://diana.uthct.edu/proclass.html", "authors": ["Cathy H.
