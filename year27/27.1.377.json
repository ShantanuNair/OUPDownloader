The COMPOUND section is a collection of metabolic compounds, as well as macromolecules, chemical elements and other chemical substances in a living cell. The ENZYME section is a collection of all known enzymatic reactions, together with the information of enzyme molecules, classified according to the EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers. The REACTION section is a new addition to the database containing metabolic reactions that appear in the pathway diagrams of the KEGG/PATHWAY database and/or in the ENZYME section. The LIGAND database can be accessed through the WWW (http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget/ligand.html) or may be downloaded by anonymous FTP (ftp://kegg.genome.ad.jp/molecules/ligand/).", "authors": ["Susumu Goto", "Takaaki Nishioka", "Minoru Kanehisa"], "about": ["elements", "genome", "ligands", "enzymes", "macromolecule", "reactions", "molecule", "biochemical reactions", "chemical reactions", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "LIGAND database for enzymes, compounds and reactions\r\n "}
