The genes coding for proteins are multi-aligned based on the translated sequences and both the nucleotide and amino acid multi-alignments are provided. as far as the genes coding for tRNAs are concerned, the multi-alignments based on the primary and the secondary structures are both provided; for the mammalian D-loop multi-alignments we report the conserved regions of the entire D-loop (CSB1, CSB2, CSB3, the central region, ETAS1 and ETAS2) as defined by Sbis\u00e0 et al. [Gene (1997), 205, 125\u2013140). A flatfile format for AMmtDB has been designed allowing its implementation in SRS (http://bio-www.ba.cnr.it:8000/Biowww/#AMMTDB). Data selected through SRS can be managed using GeneDoc or other programs for the management of multi-aligned data depending on the user's operative system. The multiple alignments have been produced with CLUSTALV and PILEUP programs and then carefully optimized manually.", "authors": ["Cecilia Lanave", "Marcella Attimonelli", "Mariateresa De Robertis", "Flavio Licciulli", "Sabino Liuni", "Elisabetta Sbis\u00e0", "Cecilia Saccone"], "about": ["mitochondria", "amino acids", "dna, mitochondrial", "genes", "mammals", "nucleotides", "regulatory sequences, nucleic acid", "vertebrates", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Update of AMmtDB: a database of multi-aligned metazoa mitochondrial DNA sequences\r\n "}
