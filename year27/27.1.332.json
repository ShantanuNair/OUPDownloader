They are responsible for maintaining the fidelity of transfer of genetic information from DNA into protein. The database is a compilation of amino acid sequences of all aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases known to date. It contains 422 primary structures of the AARSs available as separate entries or alignments of related proteins.
