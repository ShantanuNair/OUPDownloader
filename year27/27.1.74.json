The latest protein structure and comparison tools available at SGD are presented here. With the completion of the yeast sequence and the Caenorhabditis elegans sequence soon to follow, comparison of proteins from complete eukaryotic proteomes will be an extremely powerful way to learn more about a particular protein's structure, its function, and its relationships with other proteins. SGD can be accessed through the World Wide Web at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/", "authors": ["Stephen A. Chervitz", "Erich T. Hester", "Catherine A.
