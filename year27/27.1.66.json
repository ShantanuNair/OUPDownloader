CyanoBase contains annotations to each protein-coding gene, deduced from the entire nucleotide sequence of the genome, gene classification lists, keywords and similarity search engines. The present paper describes a recent extension of CyanoBase, named CyanoMutants. CyanoMutants is a repository database of mutant information on PCC6803. Each entry contains a dataset which describes a gene identifier, mutant information, and an address for correspondence. Two closely-linked databases, CyanoBase and CyanoMutants, connect information obtained from computational analysis to experimental analysis resulting in the clarification of the functions of hypothetical genes of the cyanobacterial genome. CyanoMutants can be accessed at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/mutants/", "authors": ["Yasukazu Nakamura", "Takakazu Kaneko", "Nobuyuki Miyajima", "Satoshi Tabata"], "about": ["base sequence", "genes", "genome", "internet", "synechocystis", "search engine", "datasets", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Extension of CyanoBase.
