Sequences and related information on individuals, such as from where the sequences were obtained, is stored in three ASCii files as described previously. Moreover, the collection is also available as Mac/PC database application with a graphical user interface. It can be accessed through the WWW at URL http://www.eva.mpg.de/hvrbase. The current collection comprises 5846 human sequences from hypervariable region I (HVRI) and 2302 human sequences from hypervariable region II (HVRII). From apes, 295 HVRI sequences and 13 HVRII sequences are available.", "authors": ["Florian Burckhardt", "Arndt von Haeseler", "Sonja Meyer"], "about": ["complementarity determining regions", "dna, mitochondrial", "pongidae", "primates", "user-computer interface", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "HvrBase: compilation of mtDNA control region sequences from primates\r\n "}
