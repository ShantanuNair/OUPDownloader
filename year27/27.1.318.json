In addition to being updated and extended by new features, it has been complemented now by a series of additional database modules. among them, modules which provide data about signal transduction pathways (TRANSPATH) or about cell types/organs/developmental stages (CYTOMER) are available as well as an updated version of the previously described compel database. the databases are available on the www at http://transfac.gbf.de/", "authors": ["T.
