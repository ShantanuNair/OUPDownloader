The data are collected from literature and compiled into a common format. The current release of PhosphoBase (October 1998, version 2.0) comprises 414 phosphoprotein entries covering 1052 phosphorylatable serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. The kinetic data from peptide phosphorylation assays for \u223c330 oligopeptides is also included. The database entries are cross-referenced to the corresponding records in the Swiss-Prot protein database and literature references are linked to MedLine records. PhosphoBase is available via the WWW at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/PhosphoBase/", "authors": ["Andres Kreegipuu", "Nikolaj Blom", "S\u00f8ren Brunak"], "about": ["protein databases", "medline", "oligopeptides", "peptides", "phosphoproteins", "phosphorylation", "protein kinase", "serine", "threonine", "kinetics", "tyrosine", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "PhosphoBase, a database of phosphorylation sites: release 2.0\r\n "}
