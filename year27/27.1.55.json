{"keywords": ["metabolism", "genes", "genome", "user-computer interface", "enzymes", "escherichia coli"], "abstract": "The EcoCyc database describes the genome and gene products of Escherichia coli, its metabolic and signaltransduction pathways, and its trNAS. The database describes 4391 genes of E.coli, 695 enzymes encoded by a subset of these genes, 904 metabolic reactions that occur in E.coli, and the organization of these reactions into 129 metabolic pathways. The EcoCyc graphical user interface allows scientists to query and explore the EcoCyc database using visualization tools such as genomic-map browsers and automatic layouts of metabolic pathways. EcoCyc has many references to the primary literature, and is a (qualitative) computational model of E.coli metabolism.
