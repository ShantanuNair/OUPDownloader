It has been developed from a previous compilation of higher plant mitochondrial tRNA genes [Sagliano,A., Volpicella,M., Gallerani,R. and Ceci,L.R. (1998) Nucleic Acids Res., 26, 154\u2013155] and implemented with data and sequences of tRNA molecules retrieved from the literature. The current version of the database reports information on 171 genes and 16 tRNA molecules from 24 plants. PLMItRNA is accessible via WWW at http://bio-www.ba.cnr.it:8000/srs/", "authors": ["Luigi R.
