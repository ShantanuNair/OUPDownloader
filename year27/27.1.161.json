Scores of snoRNAs have been discovered in recent years from various eukaryotes, and the total number is predicted to be up to 200 different snoRNA species per individual organism. We have created a comprehensive database for snoRNAs from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which allows easy access to detailed information about each species known (almost 70 snoRNAs are featured). The database consists of three major parts: (i) a utilities section; (ii) a master table; and (iii) a collection of tables for the individual snoRNAs. The utilities section provides an introduction to the database. The master table lists all known s.cerevisiae snoRNAs and their major properties. Information in the individual tables includes: alternate names, size, family classification, genomic organization, sequences (with major features identified), GenBank accession numbers, occurrence of homologues, gene disruption phenotypes, functional properties and associated RNAs and proteins. All information is accompanied with appropriate literature references. The database is available on the World Wide Web (http://www.bio.umass.edu/biochem/rna-sequence/Yeast_snoRNA_Database/snoRNA_DataBase.html), and should be useful for a wide range of snoRNA studies.", "authors": ["Dmitry A.
