A problem is that the quality of the annotations of these very large sequences is usually lower than those of the shorter entries encountered in the repository collections. Moreover, classical sequence database management systems have difficulties in handling entries of that size. In this context, we have decided to build the Enhanced Microbial Genomes Library (EMGLib) in which these two problems are alleviated. This library contains all the complete genomes from bacteria already sequenced and the yeast genome in GenBank format. The annotations are improved by the introduction of data on codon usage, gene orientation on the chromosome and gene families. It is possible to access emglib through two database systems set up on World Wide Web servers: the PBIL server at http://pbil.univlyon1.fr/emglib/emglib.html and the MICADO server at http://locus.jouy.inra.fr/micado", "authors": ["Guy Perri\u00e8re", "Philippe Bessi\u00e8res", "Bernard Labedan"], "about": ["database management systems", "haemophilus influenzae", "chromosomes", "codon nucleotides", "genes", "genome", "genome, bacterial", "internet", "libraries", "yeasts", "bacteria", "genbank", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The Enhanced Microbial Genomes Library\r\n "}
