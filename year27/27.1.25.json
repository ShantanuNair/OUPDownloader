{"keywords": ["arabidopsis", "dna", "genome", "human", "pyrococcus", "software", "japanese"], "abstract": "The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (http//:www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) has developed a software system for mass submissions to cope with a recent expansion of EST and genome data submissions. The system is composed of four parts, the www data submission, large-scale submission, submission management and storing. Using this system one can submit data on a large number of sequences or a very long sequence while checking the consistency between the annotation and sequence without much effort. DDBJ has received large scale data of Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis and Pyrococcus from Japanese researchers who made full use of the new submission system.", "authors": ["Hideaki Sugawara", "Satoru Miyazaki", "Takashi Gojobori", "Yoshio Tateno"], "about": ["arabidopsis", "dna", "genome", "human", "pyrococcus", "software", "japanese", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "DNA Data Bank of Japan dealing with large-scale data submission\r\n "}
