The five species files\u2014Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, Neurospora crassa and Homo sapiens\u2014include annotated data derived from a variety of online resources and the literature. A wide spectrum of search facilities is given in the interelated sections \u2018Gene catalogues\u2019, \u2018Protein catalogues\u2019, \u2018Homologies\u2019, \u2018Pathways and metabolism\u2019, and \u2018Human disease catalogue\u2019 including extensive references and hyperlinks for each entry. Precomputed FASTA searches using all the MITOP yeast protein entries and a list of the best EST hits with graphical cluster alignments related to the yeast reference sequence are presented. The MITOP orthologue tables with cross-listing to all the protein entries for each species in the database facilitate investigations into interspecies homology. A program (MITOPROT) is available to identify mitochondrial targeting sequences and graphical depictions of several important mitochondrial processes are included. The \u2018Human disease catalogue\u2019 lists a total of 101 disorders related to mitochondrial protein abnormalities, sorted by clinical criteria and age of onset.", "authors": ["C. Scharfe", "P.
