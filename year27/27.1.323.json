Particular emphasis has been placed on documenting conflicts between similar sequence entries from a number of source databases, conflicts that are not necessarily documented in the source databases themselves. New additions to the database include compilations of post-translational modifications for each of the core and linker histones, as well as genomic information in the form of map loci for the human histone gene complement, with the genetic loci linked to Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). The database is freely accessible through the World Wide Web at either http://genome.nhgri.nih.gov/histones/ or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Baxevani/HISTONES", "authors": ["Izabela Makalowska", "Erik S.
