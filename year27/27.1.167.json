The alignment of the tmRNAS emphasizes the basepairs that are supported by comparative sequence analysis and establishes minimal secondary structures for the known tmRNAs. A corresponding alignment of the predicted tmrnaencoded tag peptides is presented. the tmRDB also offers a small number of RNA secondary structure diagrams and PDB-formatted three-dimensional models generated with the program ERNA-3D.
