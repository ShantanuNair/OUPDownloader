{"keywords": ["mutation", "amino acids", "color", "sequence homology"], "abstract": "Currently the protein mutant database (PMD) contains over 81 000 mutants, including artificial as well as natural mutants of various proteins extracted from about 10 000 articles. We recently developed a powerful viewing and retrieving system (http://pmd.ddbj.nig.ac.jp), which is integrated with the sequence and tertiary structure databases. The system has the following features: (i) mutated sequences are displayed after being automatically generated from the information described in the entry together with the sequence data of wild-type proteins integrated. This is a convenient feature because it allows one to see the position of altered amino acids (shown in a different color) in the entire sequence of a wild-type protein; (ii) for those proteins whose 3D structures have been experimentally determined, a 3D structure is displayed to show mutation sites in a different color; (iii) a sequence homology search against PMD can be carried out with any query sequence; (iv) a summary of mutations of homologous sequences can be displayed, which shows all the mutations at a certain site of a protein, recorded throughout the PMD.", "authors": ["Takeshi Kawabata", "Motonori Ota", "Ken Nishikawa"], "about": ["mutation", "amino acids", "color", "sequence homology", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The Protein Mutant Database\r\n "}
