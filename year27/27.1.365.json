{"keywords": ["mitochondria", "genes", "internet", "libraries", "organizations", "rats"], "abstract": "KEYnet is a database where gene and protein names are hierarchically structured. Particular care has been devoted to the search and organisation of synonyms. The structuring is based on biological criteria in order to assist the user in the data search and to minimise the risk of loss of information. Links to the EMBL data library by the entry name and the accession number have been implemented. KEYnet is available through the World Wide Web at the following site: http://www.ba.cnr.it/keynet.html. Recently KEYnet has incorporated specific gene name classifications, which can be browsed starting from the abovementioned KEYnet home page: the Mitochondrial Gene Names classification and the Rat Gene Names classification. KEYnet database has also been structured in a flatfile format and can be queried through SRS (http://bio-www.ba.cnr.t:8000/srs).", "authors": ["F. Licciulli", "D. Catalano", "D. D'Elia", "V.
