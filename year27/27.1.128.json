{"keywords": ["mitochondria", "genetic disorder", "biotechnology", "dna, mitochondrial", "genes", "bioinformatics"], "abstract": "Mitbase is an integrated and comprehensive database of mitochondrial DNA data which collects all available information from different organisms and from intraspecie variants and mutants. Research institutions from different countries are involved, each in charge of developing, collecting and annotating data for the organisms they are specialised in. The design of the actual structure of the database and its implementation in a user-friendly format are the care of the European Bioinformatics Institute. The database can be accessed on the Web at the following address: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/htbin/Mitbase/mitbase.pl. The impact of this project is intended for both basic and applied research. The study of mitochondrial genetic diseases and mitochondrial DNA intraspecie diversity are key topics in several biotechnological fields. The database has been funded within the EU Biotechnology programme.", "authors": ["M. Attimonelli", "N. Altamura", "R. Benne", "C. Boyen", "A. Brennicke", "A. Carone", "J. M. Cooper", "D.
