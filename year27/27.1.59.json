In this paper we describe the main computational changes to the database, which include migrating the database to Sybase, providing graphical descriptions of the internal organization of operons and regulons, and direct links to MEDLINE references. The web interface offers searching either by mechanisms of regulation or by operon organization. The results of a search (operon organization, or site collection) are displayed as hypertext, and can also be displayed graphically. In terms of its contents, RegulonDB contains a large number of operons, as well as the absolute position in the completed genome sequence of sites, promoters, and individual genes of E.coli.", "authors": ["Heladia Salgado", "Alberto Santos", "Ulises Garza-Ramos", "Jacques van Helden", "Edgar D\u00edaz", "Julio Collado-Vides"], "about": ["genes", "genome", "medline", "oncogenes", "operon", "regulon", "interferon alfacon-1", "escherichia coli", "transcriptional control", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "RegulonDB (version 2.0): a database on transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli\n "}
