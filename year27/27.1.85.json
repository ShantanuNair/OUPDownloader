{"keywords": ["drosophila", "genome", "community"], "abstract": "The flybase drosophila genetics database and the public interfaces of the berkeley drosophila genome project (bdgp) and european drosophila genome project (edgp) are in the process of integrating. at present, the data of these projects are available from independent, but hyperlinked, www sites (flybase url, http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/; BDGP URL, http://fruitfly.berkeley.edu/; EDGP URL, http://edgp.ebi.ac.uk/). Because of the considerable overlap of data classes between the contributions of the Drosophila genome projects and the Drosophila community, the new and enlarged FlyBase consortium views the implementation of a single integrated Drosophila genomics/genetics server as essential to the scientific community. This integration will occur in a stepwise fashion over the next 1\u20132 years. In this report, the salient features of the current databases and how to interrogate and navigate the extensive data sets are discussed.", "authors": [], "about": ["drosophila", "genome", "community", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The FlyBase Database of the Drosophila Genome Projects and community literature\r\n "}
