The Integrated X Chromosome Database (IXDB, http://ixdb.mpimgberlin-dahlem.mpg.de/ ) is a repository for physical mapping data of the human X chromosome and aims at providing a global view of genomic data at a chromosomal level. We present here an update of IXDB which includes schema extensions for storing submaps and sequence information, additional links to external databases, and the integration of an increasing number of physical and transcript mapping data. The gene data was completely updated according to the approved gene symbols of the HUGO Nomenclature Committee. IXDB receives over 1000 queries per month, an indication that its content is valuable to researchers seeking mapping data of the human X chromosome.", "authors": ["Ulf Leser", "Hugues Roest Crollius", "Hans Lehrach", "Ralf Sudbrak"], "about": ["physical mapping", "chromosomes", "genes", "genome", "molecular biology", "x chromosomes", "genetics", "mendelian inheritance in man, online", "symbols", "schema", "genbank", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "IXDB, an X chromosome integrated database (update)\r\n "}
