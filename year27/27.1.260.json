{"keywords": ["internet", "tertiary protein structure", "software"], "abstract": "Pfam is a collection of multiple alignments and profile hidden Markov models of protein domain families. Release 3.1 is a major update of the Pfam database and contains 1313 families which are available on the World Wide Web in Europe at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/ and http://www.cgr.ki.se/Pfam/, and in the US at http://pfam.wustl.edu/. Over 54% of proteins in SWISS-PROT-35 and SP-TrEMBL-5 match a Pfam family. The primary changes of Pfam since release 2.1 are that we now use the more advanced version 2 of the HMMER software, which is more sensitive and provides expectation values for matches, and that it now includes proteins from both SP-TrEMBL and SWISS-PROT.", "authors": ["Alex Bateman", "Ewan Birney", "Richard Durbin", "Sean R.
