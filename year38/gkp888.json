{"keywords": ["genes", "genome", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "micrornas"], "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small, non-protein coding RNA molecules known to regulate the expression of genes by binding to the 3\u2032UTR region of mRNAs. MicroRNAs are produced from longer transcripts which can code for more than one mature miRNAs. miRGen 2.0 is a database that aims to provide comprehensive information about the position of human and mouse microRNA coding transcripts and their regulation by transcription factors, including a unique compilation of both predicted and experimentally supported data. Expression profiles of microRNAs in several tissues and cell lines, single nucleotide polymorphism locations, microRNA target prediction on protein coding genes and mapping of miRNA targets of co-regulated miRNAs on biological pathways are also integrated into the database and user interface. The miRGen database will be continuously maintained and freely available at http://www.microrna.gr/mirgen/.", "authors": ["Panagiotis Alexiou", "Thanasis Vergoulis", "Martin Gleditzsch", "George Prekas", "Theodore Dalamagas", "Molly Megraw", "Ivo Grosse", "Timos Sellis", "Artemis G.
