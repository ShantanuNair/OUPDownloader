{"keywords": ["genes", "heat (physical force)", "rna, messenger", "gene clusters", "data mining"], "abstract": "We report the extended database and data mining resources newly released in the H-Invitational Database (H-InvDB; http://www.h-invitational.jp/). H-InvDB is a comprehensive annotation resource of human genes and transcripts, and consists of two main views and six sub-databases. The latest release of H-InvDB (release 6.2) provides the annotation for 219 765 human transcripts in 43 159 human gene clusters based on human full-length cDNAs and mRNAs. H-InvDB now provides several new annotation features, such as mapping of microarray probes, new gene models, relation to known ncRNAs and information from the Glycogene database. H-InvDB also provides useful data mining resources\u2014\u2018Navigation search\u2019, \u2018H-InvDB Enrichment Analysis Tool (HEAT)\u2019 and web service APIs. \u2018Navigation search\u2019 is an extended search system that enables complicated searches by combining 16 different search options. HEAT is a data mining tool for automatically identifying features specific to a given human gene set. HEAT searches for H-InvDB annotations that are significantly enriched in a user-defined gene set, as compared with the entire H-InvDB representative transcripts. H-InvDB now has web service APIs of SOAP and REST to allow the use of H-InvDB data in programs, providing the users extended data accessibility.", "authors": ["Chisato Yamasaki", "Katsuhiko Murakami", "Jun-ichi Takeda", "Yoshiharu Sato", "Akiko Noda", "Ryuichi Sakate", "Takuya Habara", "Hajime Nakaoka", "Fusano Todokoro", "Akihiro Matsuya", "Tadashi Imanishi", "Takashi Gojobori"], "about": ["genes", "heat (physical force)", "rna, messenger", "gene clusters", "data mining", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "H-InvDB in 2009: extended database and data mining resources for human genes and transcripts\r\n "}
