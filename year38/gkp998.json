ENA has made significant contributions to the collaborative nucleotide archival arena as an active proponent of extending the traditional collaboration to cover capillary and next-generation sequencing information. We have continued to co-develop data and metadata representation formats with our collaborators for both data exchange and public data dissemination. In addition to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank feature table format, we share metadata formats for capillary and next-generation sequencing traces and are using and contributing to the NCBI SRA Toolkit for the long-term storage of the next-generation sequence traces. During the course of 2009, ENA has significantly improved sequence submission, search and access functionalities provided at EMBL\u2013EBI. In this article, we briefly describe the content and scope of our archive and introduce major improvements to our services.", "authors": ["Rasko Leinonen", "Ruth Akhtar", "Ewan Birney", "James Bonfield", "Lawrence Bower", "Matt Corbett", "Ying Cheng", "Fehmi Demiralp", "Nadeem Faruque", "Neil Goodgame", "Richard Gibson", "Gemma Hoad", "Christopher Hunter", "Mikyung Jang", "Steven Leonard", "Quan Lin", "Rodrigo Lopez", "Michael Maguire", "Hamish McWilliam", "Sheila Plaister", "Rajesh Radhakrishnan", "Siamak Sobhany", "Guy Slater", "Petra Ten Hoopen", "Franck Valentin", "Robert Vaughan", "Vadim Zalunin", "Daniel Zerbino", "Guy Cochrane"], "about": ["metadata", "base sequence", "nucleotides", "blood capillaries", "massively-parallel genome sequencing", "genbank", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Improvements to services at the European Nucleotide Archive\r\n "}
