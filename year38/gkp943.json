However, exploration of these massive data remains a daunting challenge. In this study, we describe a novel database, deepBase, which we have developed to facilitate the comprehensive annotation and discovery of small RNAs from transcriptomic data. The current release of deepBase contains deep sequencing data from 185 small RNA libraries from diverse tissues and cell lines of seven organisms: human, mouse, chicken, Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenhorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana. By analyzing \u223c14.6 million unique reads that perfectly mapped to more than 284 million genomic loci, we annotated and identified \u223c380 000 unique ncRNA-associated small RNAs (nasRNAs), \u223c1.5 million unique promoter-associated small RNAs (pasRNAs), \u223c4.0 million unique exon-associated small RNAs (easRNAs) and \u223c6 million unique repeat-associated small RNAs (rasRNAs). Furthermore, 2038 miRNA and 1889 snoRNA candidates were predicted by miRDeep and snoSeeker. All of the mapped reads can be grouped into about 1.2 million RNA clusters. For the purpose of comparative analysis, deepBase provides an integrative, interactive and versatile display. A convenient search option, related publications and other useful information are also provided for further investigation. deepBase is available at: http://deepbase.sysu.edu.cn/.", "authors": ["Jian-Hua Yang", "Peng Shao", "Hui Zhou", "Yue-Qin Chen", "Liang-Hu Qu"], "about": ["arabidopsis", "cell lines", "chickens", "ciona intestinalis", "drosophila melanogaster", "exons", "genome", "libraries", "mining", "small nucleolar rna", "mice", "rna", "rna, small", "micrornas", "massively-parallel genome sequencing", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "deepBase: a database for deeply annotating and mining deep sequencing data\r\n "}
