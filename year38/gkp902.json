UTRdb is a curated database of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs, derived from several sources of primary data. Experimentally validated functional motifs are annotated and also collated as the UTRsite database where more specific information on the functional motifs and cross-links to interacting regulatory protein are provided. In the current update, the UTR entries have been organized in a gene-centric structure to better visualize and retrieve 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTR variants generated by alternative initiation and termination of transcription and alternative splicing. Experimentally validated miRNA targets and conserved sequence elements are also annotated. The integration of UTRdb with genomic data has allowed the implementation of an efficient annotation system and a powerful retrieval resource for the selection and extraction of specific UTR subsets. All internet resources implemented for retrieval and functional analysis of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs are accessible at http://utrdb.ba.itb.cnr.it/.", "authors": ["Giorgio Grillo", "Antonio Turi", "Flavio Licciulli", "Flavio Mignone", "Sabino Liuni", "Sandro Banfi", "Vincenzo Alessandro Gennarino", "David S.
