It is promoted by 27 core resource facilities, each concerned with a particular group of organisms, and by one information center. The NBRP database is a product of this project. Thirty databases and an integrated database-retrieval system (BioResource World: BRW) have been created and made available through the NBRP home page (http://www.nbrp.jp). The 30 independent databases have individual features which directly reflect the data maintained by each resource facility. The BRW is designed for users who need to search across several resources without moving from one database to another. BRW provides access to a collection of 4.5-million records on bioresources including wild species, inbred lines, mutants, genetically engineered lines, DNA clones and so on. BRW supports summary browsing, keyword searching, and searching by DNA sequences or gene ontology. The results of searches provide links to online requests for distribution of research materials. A circulation system allows users to submit details of papers published on research conducted using NBRP resources.", "authors": ["Yukiko Yamazaki", "Ryo Akashi", "Yutaka Banno", "Takashi Endo", "Hiroshi Ezura", "Kaoru Fukami-Kobayashi", "Kazuo Inaba", "Tadashi Isa", "Katsuhiko Kamei", "Fumie Kasai", "Masatomo Kobayashi", "Nori Kurata", "Makoto Kusaba", "Tetsuro Matuzawa", "Shohei Mitani", "Taro Nakamura", "Yukio Nakamura", "Norio Nakatsuji", "Kiyoshi Naruse", "Hironori Niki", "Eiji Nitasaka", "Yuichi Obata", "Hitoshi Okamoto", "Moriya Okuma", "Kazuhiro Sato", "Tadao Serikawa", "Toshihiko Shiroishi", "Hideaki Sugawara", "Hideko Urushibara", "Masatoshi Yamamoto", "Yoshio Yaoita", "Atsushi Yoshiki", "Yuji Kohara"], "about": ["biological sciences", "clone cells", "dna", "genes", "genetic engineering", "genome", "information centers", "rice", "rats", "japanese", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "NBRP databases: databases of biological resources in Japan\r\n "}
