The main purpose of this platform is to establish a network of lung cancer-related molecules and to facilitate the mechanistic study of lung carcinogenesis. The entries describing the relationships between molecules and human lung cancer in the current release were extracted manually from literatures. Currently, we have collected 2585 genes and 212 miRNA with the experimental evidences involved in the different stages of lung carcinogenesis through text mining. Furthermore, we have incorporated the results from analysis of transcription factor-binding motifs, the promoters and the SNP sites for each gene. Since epigenetic alterations also play an important role in lung carcinogenesis, genes with epigenetic regulation were also included. We hope HLungDB will enrich our knowledge about lung cancer biology and eventually lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
