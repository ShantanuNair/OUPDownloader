In this update, we included 330 million new tags generated by massively sequencing the 5\u2032-end of oligo-cap selected cDNAs in humans and mice. The tags were collected from normal fetal or adult human tissues, including brain, thymus, liver, kidney and heart, from 6 human cell lines in 21 diverse growth conditions as well as from mouse NIH3T3 cell line: altogether 31 different cell types or culture conditions are represented. This unprecedented increase in depth of data now allows DBTSS to faithfully represent the dynamically changing landscape of TSSs in different cell types and conditions, during development and in the course of evolution. Differential usage of alternative 5\u2032-ends across cell types and conditions can be viewed in a series of new interfaces. Promoter sequence information is now displayed in a comparative genomics viewer where evolutionary turnover of the TSSs can be evaluated. DBTSS can be accessed at http://dbtss.hgc.jp/.", "authors": ["Riu Yamashita", "Hiroyuki Wakaguri", "Sumio Sugano", "Yutaka Suzuki", "Kenta Nakai"], "about": ["databases", "adult", "cell lines", "fetus", "genomics", "oligonucleotides", "rna, messenger", "transcription initiation site", "brain", "heart", "kidney", "liver", "mice", "thymus gland", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "DBTSS provides a tissue specific dynamic view of Transcription Start Sites\r\n "}
