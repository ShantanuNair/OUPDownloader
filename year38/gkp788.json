Although only a small proportion of genes utilize recoding in protein synthesis, accurate annotation of \u2018recoded\u2019 genes lags far behind annotation of \u2018standard\u2019 genes. In order to address this issue, provide a service to researchers in the field, and offer training data for developers of gene-annotation software, we have gathered together known cases of recoding within the Recode database. Recode-2 is an improved and updated version of the database. It provides access to detailed information on genes known to utilize translational recoding and allows complex search queries, browsing of recoding data and enhanced visualization of annotated sequence elements. At present, the Recode-2 database stores information on approximately 1500 genes that are known to utilize recoding in their expression\u2014a factor of approximately three increase over the previous version of the database.
