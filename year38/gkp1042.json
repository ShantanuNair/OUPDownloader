{"keywords": ["membrane proteins", "mutagenesis", "integral membrane proteins"], "abstract": "Membrane proteins are important for many processes in the cell and used as main drug targets. The increasing number of high-resolution structures available makes for the first time a characterization of local structural and functional motifs in \u03b1-helical transmembrane proteins possible. MeMotif (http://projects.biotec.tu-dresden.de/memotif) is a database and wiki which collects more than 2000 known and novel computationally predicted linear motifs in \u03b1-helical transmembrane proteins. Motifs are fully described in terms of several structural and functional features and editable. Motifs contained in MeMotif can be used in different biological applications, from the identification of biochemically important functional residues which are candidates for mutagenesis experiments to the improvement of tools for transmembrane protein modeling.", "authors": ["Annalisa Marsico", "Kerstin Scheubert", "Anne Tuukkanen", "Andreas Henschel", "Christof Winter", "Rainer Winnenburg", "Michael Schroeder"], "about": ["membrane proteins", "mutagenesis", "integral membrane proteins", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "MeMotif: a database of linear motifs in \u03b1-helical transmembrane proteins\r\n "}
