{"keywords": ["base pairing", "dna", "ligands", "software", "sugar phosphates", "sugars", "protein data bank", "molecule"], "abstract": "3DNALandscapes, located at: http://3DNAscapes.rutgers.edu, is a new database for exploring the conformational features of DNA. In contrast to most structural databases, which archive the Cartesian coordinates and/or derived parameters and images for individual structures, 3DNALandscapes enables searches of conformational information across multiple structures. The database contains a wide variety of structural parameters and molecular images, computed with the 3DNA software package and known to be useful for characterizing and understanding the sequence-dependent spatial arrangements of the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, sugar-base side groups, base pairs, base-pair steps, groove structure, etc. The data comprise all DNA-containing structures\u2014both free and bound to proteins, drugs and other ligands\u2014currently available in the Protein Data Bank. The web interface allows the user to link, report, plot and analyze this information from numerous perspectives and thereby gain insight into DNA conformation, deformability and interactions in different sequence and structural contexts. The data accumulated from known, well-resolved DNA structures can serve as useful benchmarks for the analysis and simulation of new structures. The collective data can also help to understand how DNA deforms in response to proteins and other molecules and undergoes conformational rearrangements.", "authors": ["Guohui Zheng", "Andrew V.
