The complete sets of 84 families of TFs and TRs from 19 species ranging from unicellular red and green algae to angiosperms are included in PlnTFDB, representing >1.6 billion years of evolution of gene regulatory networks. For each gene family, a basic description is provided that is complemented by literature references, and multiple sequence alignments of protein domains. TF or TR gene entries include information of expressed sequence tags, 3D protein structures of homologous proteins, domain architecture and cross-links to other computational resources online. Moreover, the different species in PlnTFDB are linked to each other by means of orthologous genes facilitating cross-species comparisons.", "authors": ["Paulino P\u00e9rez-Rodr\u00edguez", "Diego Mauricio Ria\u00f1o-Pach\u00f3n", "Luiz Gustavo Guedes Corr\u00eaa", "Stefan A.
