This has been performed by statistically evaluating the \u2018logs\u2019 of the Internet servers that are used for its distribution with reference to the geographical origin of the requests, the words that were utilized to carry out of the searches and the oligonucleotides that were retrieved. Planned enhancements of this database are also described. They include a revision of its data structure and, even more relevant, of its data management procedures.
