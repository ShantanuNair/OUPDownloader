Alterations from organisms other than Escherichia coli are reported at positions according to the E.coli numbering system. Information provided for each mutation includes: (i) a brief description of the phenotype(s) associated with each mutation, (ii) whether a mutant phenotype has been detected by in vivo or in vitro methods, and (iii) relevant literature citations.
