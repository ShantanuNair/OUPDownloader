{"keywords": ["gene expression regulation", "rna, messenger", "untranslated regions", "redundancy"], "abstract": " The important role the untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs may play in gene regulation and expression is now widely acknowledged. For this reason we developed UTRdb, a specialized database of 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs cleaned from redundancy. UTRdb entries are enriched with specialized information not present in the primary databases, including the presence of functional patterns already demonstrated by experimental analysis to have some functional role. A collection of such patterns is being collected in UTRsite database ( http://bio-www.ba.cnr.it:8000/srs5/ ) which can also be used with appropriate computational tools to detect known functional patterns contained in mRNA untranslated regions.
