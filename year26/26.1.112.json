MITOMAP uses the mtDNA sequence as the unifying element for bringing together information on mitochondrial genome structure and function, pathogenic mutations and their clinical characteristics, population associated variation, and gene-gene interactions. Over the past year we have increased the degree of interlinking of MITOMAP information available on the web page, by using our generalized information management system, GENOME. As increasingly larger regions of the human genome are sequenced and characterized, the need for integrating such information is growing. Consequently, MITOMAP and GENOME provide a valuable reference for the mitochondrial biologist, in addition to being a model for the development of comprehensive, information storage and retrieval systems for other components of the human genome. This paper documents the changes to MITOMAP which have been implemented over the past year. ", "authors": ["Andreas M. Kogelnik", "Marie T. Lott", "Michael D. Brown", "Shamkant B.
