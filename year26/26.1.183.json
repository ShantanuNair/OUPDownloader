{"keywords": ["protein structure, secondary", "ribosomal rna", "rna", "ribosome subunits, large"], "abstract": " The rRNA WWW Server at URL http://www.rrna.uia.ac.be/ now provides a database of 496 large subunit ribosomal RNA sequences. All these sequences are aligned, incorporate secondary structure information, and can be obtained in a number of formats. Other information about the sequences, such as literature references, accession numbers and taxonomic information is also available and searchable. If necessary, the data on the server can also be obtained by anonymous ftp.
