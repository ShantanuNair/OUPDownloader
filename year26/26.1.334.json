{"keywords": ["base sequence", "codon nucleotides", "dna", "genes", "genbank"], "abstract": " CUTG (codon usage tabulated from GenBank) is a comprehensive database for codon usage. The codon usage for each full-length protein gene has been calculated using the nucleotide sequence obtained from GenBank sequence database. The sum of the codon use of each organism has been also calculated. The data files can be obtained from anonymous ftp sites of DDBJ, DISC and EBI. The list of codonusage of genes in organisms was made searchableby name of organism through a web site http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/~nakamura/CUTG.html The compilation is synchronized with major release of GenBank.
