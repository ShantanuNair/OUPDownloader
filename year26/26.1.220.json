{"keywords": ["phenotype", "mutation", "chromosomes", "haplotypes"], "abstract": "PAHdb ( http://www.mcgill.ca/pahdb ) is a curated relational database ( Fig.\u00a01 ) of nucleotide variation in the human PAH cDNA (GenBank U49897). Among 328 different mutations by state ( Fig.\u00a02 ) the majority are rare mutations causing hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) (OMIM 261600), the remainder are polymorphic variants without apparent effect on phenotype. PAHdb modules contain mutations, polymorphic haplotypes, genotype-phenotype correlations, expression analysis, sources of information and the reference sequence; the database also contains pages of clinical information and data on three ENU mouse orthologues of human HPA. Only six different mutations account for 60% of human HPA chromosomes worldwide, mutations stratify by population and geographic region, and the Oriental and Caucasian mutation sets are different ( Fig.\u00a03 ). PAHdb provides curated electronic publication and one third of its incoming reports are direct submissions. Each different mutation receives a systematic (nucleotide) name and a unique identifier (UID). Data are accessed both by a Newsletter and a search engine on the website; integrity of the database is ensured by keeping the curated template offline. There have been >6500 online interrogations of the website. ", "authors": ["Piotr M. Nowacki", "Susan Byck", "Lynne Prevost", "Charles R.
