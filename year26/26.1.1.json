{"keywords": ["genome", "genbank"], "abstract": " The GenBank\u00ae sequence database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) incorporates DNA sequences from all available public sources, primarily through the direct submission of sequence data from individual laboratories and from large-scale sequencing projects. Most submitters use the BankIt (WWW) or Sequin programs to send their sequence data. Data exchange with the EMBL Data Library and the DNA Data Bank of Japan helps ensure comprehensive worldwide coverage. GenBank data is accessible through NCBI's integrated retrieval system, Entrez , which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome and protein structure information. MEDLINE\u00ae abstracts from published articles describing the sequences are also included as an additional source of biological annotation. Sequence similarity searching is offered through the BLAST series of database search programs. In addition to FTP, e-mail and server/client versions of Entrez and BLAST, NCBI offers a wide range of World Wide Web retrieval and analysis services of interest to biologists.
