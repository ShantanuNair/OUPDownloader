{"keywords": ["mitochondria", "base sequence", "genes", "plants", "transfer rna"], "abstract": " A new version of the compilation of higher plant mitochondrial tRNA genes ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/services.html ) has been obtained by means of the FastA program for similarity searching in nucleotide sequence Databases. This approach improves the previous collection, which was based on literature data analysis. The current compilation contains 158 sequences with an increase of 43 units. In this paper, some interesting features of the new entries are briefly presented. ", "authors": ["A. Sagliano", "M. Volpicella", "R. Gallerani", "L. R.
