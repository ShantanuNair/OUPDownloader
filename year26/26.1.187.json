{"keywords": ["internet", "ligands", "ribosomes", "escherichia coli", "cross-linking"], "abstract": " The Database of Ribosomal Cross-links (DRC) provides a complete collection of all the published data produced by cross-linking studies on the Escherichia coli ribosome, as well as on its components and functional ligands. The DRC currently includes data on 986 cross-links from >100 research papers, yielded by >40 different reagents. For each cross-link, information is given concerning its location in the ribosome, the chemical or photochemical reagent applied, a brief description of the method(s) used to locate the cross-link, and the literature reference. The DRC is freely available via the World Wide Web at: http://Ribosome.Genebee.MSU.SU/DRC/ or at http://WWW:MPIMG-Berlin-Dahlem.MPG.DE/\u223cbaranov/DRC/", "authors": ["Pavel V. Baranov", "Petr V.
