In addition, several coding sequence parameters are available: coding sequence length, Nc, GC3, and, when it is computable, codon adaptation index (CAI). Codon usage tables and summaries of start and stop codon contexts are also included. The information covers more than 325 species and organelles, including seven complete bacterial genomes and one complete eukaryotic genome. To promote research in translational control of protein synthesis, TransTerm has been converted into a relational database to ease the process of making queries. The relational database manager, Postgresql, gives access to the database using SQL (Structured Query Language). A World Wide Web interface using forms is being completed to allow the casual user access to the database. Extensions are planned to include the full 5\u2032-UTR, full coding sequence and 3\u2032-UTR. TransTerm-97 is available on the World Wide Web at: http://biochem.otago.ac.nz:800/Transterm/homepage.html", "authors": ["Mark E. Dalphin", "Chris M. Brown", "Peter A. Stockwell", "Warren P.
