{"keywords": ["internet", "protein structure, secondary", "ribosomes", "ribosomal rna", "rna"], "abstract": " About 8600 complete or nearly complete sequences are now available from the Antwerp database on small ribosomal subunit RNA. All these sequences are aligned with one another on the basis of the adopted secondary structure model, which is corroborated by the observation of compensating substitutions in the alignment. Literature references, accession numbers and detailed taxonomic information are also compiled.
