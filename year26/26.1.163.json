It is employed in a remarkable trans -translation process to add a C-terminal peptide tag to the incomplete protein product of a broken mRNA; the tag targets the abnormal protein for proteolysis. tmRNA sequences have been identified in genomes of diverse bacterial phyla, including the most deeply branching. They have also been identified in plastids of the \u2018red\u2019 lineage. The tmRNA Website ( http://www.wi.mit.edu/bartel/tmRNA/home ) contains a database currently including sequences from 37 species, with provisional alignments, as well as the tentatively predicted proteolysis tag sequences. A brief review and guide to the literature is also provided. ", "authors": ["Kelly P. Williams", "David P.
