{"keywords": ["physical mapping", "x chromosomes", "genetics", "schema", "maps"], "abstract": " The integrated X chromosome database (IXDB) is a repository for physical mapping data of the human X chromosome. Its current content is the result of a strict integration of data stemming from many different sources. The main features of IXDB include a flexible and extendible schema, a comfortable and fully crossreferenced WWW interface ( http://ixdb.mpimg-berlin-dahlem.mpg.de ) and a graphical map viewer implemented in JAVA. The database stores objects used in physical mapping as well as the maps resulting from this work, but a strong emphasis is placed on recording experiments that connect objects together. This should greatly contribute to fulfilling one of the major goals of the database: to support the construction of an integrated physical, genetic, transcript and sequence map of the human X chromosome.
