{"keywords": ["mutation", "collagen", "collagen type iii"], "abstract": " The collagens are a large and diverse family of proteins which are found in the extracellular matrix. In common with one another, the 19 known collagen types have triple-helical domains of variable length but they differ with respect to their overall size and the nature and location of their globular domains. Collagen mutations lead to heritable defects of connective tissues and mutation data for collagen types I and III are presented here. The mutation data are accessible on the world wide web at http://www.le.ac.uk/genetics/collagen/", "authors": ["Raymond Dalgleish"], "about": ["mutation", "collagen", "collagen type iii", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The Human Collagen Mutation Database 1998\r\n "}
