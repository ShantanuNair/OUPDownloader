These proteins fulfil a wide range of physiological functions (hydrolases, adhesion molecules, hormone precursors) [Krejci,E., Duval,N., Chatonnet,A., Vincens,P. and Massouli\u00e9,J. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 88, 6647\u20136651]. ESTHER (for est erases, \u03b1/\u03b2 h ydrolase e nzymes and r elatives) is a database aimed at collecting in one information system, sequence data together with biological annotations and experimental biochemical results related to the structure-function analysis of the enzymes of the family. The major upgrade of the database comes from the use of a new database management system: aCHEdb which uses the ACeDB progam designed by Richard Durbin and Jean Thierry-Mieg.
