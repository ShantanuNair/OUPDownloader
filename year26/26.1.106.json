{"keywords": ["genes", "genome, human", "radiation hybrid mapping", "genetics", "maps"], "abstract": " The HuGeMap database stores the major genetic and physical maps of the human genome. It is also interconnected with the gene radiation hybrid mapping database RHdb. HuGeMap is accessible through a Web server for interactive browsing at URL http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/Hugemap , as well as through a CORBA server for effective programming. HuGeMap is intended as an attempt to build open, interconnected databases, that is databases that distribute their objects worldwide in compliance with a recognized standard of distribution. Maps can be displayed and compared with a java applet ( http://babbage.infobiogen.fr:15000/Mappet/MappetShow.html ) that queries the HuGeMap ORB server as well as the RHdb ORB server at the EBI.
