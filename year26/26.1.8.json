DNA and RNA sequences are directly submitted from researchers and genome sequencing groups and collected from the scientific literature and patent applications ( Fig.\u00a01 ). In collaboration with DDBJ and GenBank the database is produced, maintained and distributed at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Database releases are produced quarterly and are distributed on CD-ROM. EBI's network services allow access to the most up-to-date data collection via Internet and World Wide Web interface, providing database searching and sequence similarity facilities plus access to a large number of additional databases.
