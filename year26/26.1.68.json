{"keywords": ["protein databases", "proteome", "saccharomyces cerevisiae", "yeasts"], "abstract": " The Yeast Protein Database (YPD) is a curated database for the proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . It consists of \u223c6000 Yeast Protein Reports, one for each of the known or predicted yeast proteins. Each Yeast Protein Report is a one-page presentation of protein properties, annotation lines that summarize findings from the literature, and references. In the past year, the number of annotation lines has grown from 25 000 to \u223c35 000, and the number of articles curated has grown from \u223c3500 to >5000. Recently, new data types have been included in YPD: protein-protein interactions, genetic interactions, and regulators of gene expression. Finally, a new layer of information, the YPD Protein Minireviews, has recently been introduced. The Yeast Protein Database can be found on the Web at http://www.proteome.com/YPDhome.html", "authors": ["Peter E. Hodges", "William E. Payne", "James I.
