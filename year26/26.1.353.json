{"keywords": ["oncogenes", "transcription initiation site", "embolic protection devices"], "abstract": " The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) is an annotated non-redundant collection of experimentally characterised eukaryotic POL II promoters. The underlying definition of a promoter is that of a transcription initiation site. All information presented in EPD results from an independent evaluation of primary experimental data shown in the biological literature. Sequences flanking transcription initiation sites are indirectly given by pointers to EMBL sequences. The annotation part of a promoter entry includes description of the promoter-defining evidence, cross-references to other databases, and bibliographic references. Being designed as a resource for comparative sequence analysis, EPD is structured in a way that facilitates dynamic extraction of biologically meaningful promoter subsets. The database is available through the World Wide Web at URL http://cmpteam4.unil.ch", "authors": ["Roua\u00efda Cavin P\u00e9rier", "Thomas Junier", "Philipp Bucher"], "about": ["oncogenes", "transcription initiation site", "embolic protection devices", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The Eukaryotic Promoter Database EPD\r\n "}
