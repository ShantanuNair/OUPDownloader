The total number of reported mutations has risen from 272 to 309 in the past year. We have expanded the database: (i) by giving each entry an accession number; (ii) by adding information on the length of polymorphic polyglutamine (polyGln) and polyglycine (polyGly) tracts in exon 1; (iii) by adding information on large gene deletions; (iv) by providing a direct link with a completely searchable database (courtesy EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute). The addition of the exon 1 polymorphisms is discussed in light of their possible relevance as markers for predisposition to prostate or breast cancer. The database is also available on the internet ( http://www.mcgill.ca/androgendb/ ), from EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute ( ftp://www.ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/androgen ), or as a Macintosh FilemakerPro or Word file ( MC33@musica.mcgill.ca ).
