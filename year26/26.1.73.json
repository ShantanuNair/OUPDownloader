The amount of information and the number of features provided by SGD have increased greatly following the release of the S.cerevisiae genomic sequence, which is currently the only complete sequence of a eukaryotic genome. SGD aids researchers by providing not only basic information, but also tools such as sequence similarity searching that lead to detailed information about features of the genome and relationships between genes. SGD presents information using a variety of user-friendly, dynamically created graphical displays illustrating physical, genetic and sequence feature maps. SGD can be accessed via the World Wide Web at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/", "authors": ["J. Michael Cherry", "Caroline Adler", "Catherine Ball", "Stephen A. Chervitz", "Selina S.
