{"keywords": ["glycoprotein", "glycosylation", "mannose", "n-acetylglucosaminyltransferases", "polysaccharides"], "abstract": " O-GLYCBASE is a revised database of information on glycoproteins and their O-linked glycosylation sites. Entries are compiled and revised from the literature, and from the sequence databases. Entries include information about species, sequence, glycosylation sites and glycan type and is fully cross-referenced. Compared to version 2.0 the number of entries has increased by 20%. Sequence logos displaying the acceptor specificity patterns for the GalNAc, mannose and GlcNAc transferases are shown. The O-GLYCBASE database is available through the WWW at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/OGLYCBASE/", "authors": ["Jan E.
