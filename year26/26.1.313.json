{"keywords": ["sequence alignment", "protein structure", "protein data bank"], "abstract": " HSSP ( http://www.sander.embl-ebi.ac.uk/hssp/ ) is a derived database merging structure (3-D) and sequence (1-D) information. For each protein of known 3D structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we provide a multiple sequence alignment of putative homologues and a sequence profile characteristic of the protein family, centered on the known structure. The list of homologues is the result of an iterative database search in SWISS-PROT using a position-weighted dynamic programming method for sequence profile alignment (MaxHom). The database is updated frequently. The listed putative homologues are very likely to have the same 3D structure as the PDB protein to which they have been aligned. As a result, the database not only provides aligned sequence families, but also implies secondary and tertiary structures covering 33% of all sequences in SWISS-PROT.
