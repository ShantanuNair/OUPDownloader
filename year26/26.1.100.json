{"keywords": ["genes", "genbank"], "abstract": " Database interconnection requires the development of links between related objects from different databases. We built a database of links, called Virgil, to manage and distribute rich (documented) links between GDB genes and GenBank human sequences. Virgil contains 18 667 unique links. In addition to a simple Web form for ad-hoc queries, we propose a generic Web interface and a prototype CORBA server for link distribution.
