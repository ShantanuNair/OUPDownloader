Several information regarding these RNA species such as the position of their self-catalytic domains and the open reading frame of the human hepatitits delta virus are provided. The database also includes a determination of the likely ancestral sequence of most species and a prediction of the most stable secondary structures of these sequences. This online database is available on the World Wide Web ( http://www.callisto.si.usherb.ca/\u223cjpperra ). It should provide an excellent reference point for further phylogenetic and structure-function studies of these RNA species. ", "authors": ["Daniel A.
