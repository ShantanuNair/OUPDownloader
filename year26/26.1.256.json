Mutations of the VHL gene were described at first in the heritable von Hippel-Lindau disease and in the sporadic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). More recently, VHL has also been shown to harbor mutations in mesothelioma and small cell lung carcinoma. To date more than 500 mutations have been identified. These mutations are mainly private with only one hot spot at codon 167 associated with pheochromocytoma. The germline mutations are essentially missense while somatic mutations include deletions, insertions and nonsense. To standardize the collection of these informations, facilitate the mutational analysis of the VHL gene and promote the genotype-phenotype analysis, a software package along with a computerized database have been created. The current database and the analysis software are accessible via the internet and world wide web interface at the URL: http://www.umd.necker.fr", "authors": ["Christophe B\u00e9roud", "Dominique Joly", "Catherine Gallou", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Staroz", "Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Orfanelli", "Claudine Junien"], "about": ["phenotype", "pheochromocytoma", "computerized databases", "mutation", "small cell carcinoma of lung", "mutation analysis", "renal cell carcinoma", "chromosomes", "codon nucleotides", "tumor suppressor genes", "genotype", "germ-line mutation", "von hippel-lindau syndrome", "internet", "mesothelioma", "software", "mutation, somatic", "vhl gene", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Software and database for the analysis of mutations in the VHL gene\r\n "}
