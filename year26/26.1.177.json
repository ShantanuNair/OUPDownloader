{"keywords": ["bacterial proteins", "glycoprotein hormones, alpha subunit", "protein structure, secondary", "signal recognition particle", "rna"], "abstract": " This release of the SRPDB (signal recognition particle database, http://pegasus.uthct.edu/SRPDB/SRPDB.html ) adds four SRP RNA sequences (a total of 99 SRP RNA sequences), 23 SRP protein sequences (a total of 63 protein sequences from SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP21, SRP54, SRP68 or SRP72), and, for the first time, sequences of the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic SRP receptor and its homologous bacterial proteins (a total of 21 sequences). Sequences are offered phylogenetically ordered, annotated with links to the primary databases, and in aligned form. Also downloadable are sample SRP RNA secondary structure diagrams, three-dimensional models of representative SRP RNAs, and search motifs.
