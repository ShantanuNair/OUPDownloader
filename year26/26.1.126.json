The data are divided into three ASCII files that contain aligned sequences from the hypervariable region I (HVRI), from the hypervariable region II (HVRII), and the available information about the individuals, from whom the sequences stem. The current collection comprises 4079 HVRI and 969 HVRII sequences. From 728 individuals sequences of both HVRI and HVRII are available. For easy access, the collection is made available to the scientific community via World Wide Web at URL http://www.zi.biologie.uni-muenchen.de/~meyers/mtdna.html", "authors": ["Oliva Handt", "Sonja Meyer", "Arndt von Haeseler"], "about": ["mitochondria", "complementarity determining regions", "dna, mitochondrial", "internet", "organizations", "community", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Compilation of human mtDNA control region sequences\r\n "}
