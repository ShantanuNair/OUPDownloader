Constitutional mutations of this gene have been described in most patients with Denys Drash syndrome (mesangial sclerosis associated with male pseudohermaphrodism and/or Wilms' tumor), but also in patients with genitourinary abnormalities and Wilms' tumor (WT) or presenting with only unilateral or bilateral WT. Moreover, \u223c10% of Wilms' tumors carry WT1 mutations at the somatic level. To facilitate the genotype-phenotype correlation analyses, we have created a software package along with a computerized database of germline (70 entries) and somatic (28 entries) mutations reported in the literature.", "authors": ["C\u00e9cile Jeanpierre", "Christophe B\u00e9roud", "Patrick Niaudet", "Claudine Junien"], "about": ["phenotype", "computerized databases", "mutation", "denys-drash syndrome", "genes", "genotype", "gonads", "nephroblastoma", "sclerosis", "software", "urogenital abnormalities", "zinc fingers", "kidney", "transcription factor", "wt1 gene", "correlation studies", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Software and database for the analysis of mutations in the human WT1 gene\r\n "}
