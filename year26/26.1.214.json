The current version lists 580 tumours in 448 individuals belonging to 122 independent pedigrees. The database describes each p53 mutation (type of the mutation, exon and codon affected by the mutation, nucleotide and amino acid change), each family (family history of cancer, diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome), each affected individual (sex, generation, p53 status, from which parent the mutation was inherited) and each tumour (type, age of onset, p53 status\u2014loss of heterozygosity, immunostaining). Each entry contains the original reference(s). The database is freely available and can be obtained from http://www.lf2.cuni.cz", "authors": ["Z. Sedlacek", "R. Kodet", "A. Poustka", "P.
