The parental virus strain, nucleic acid sequence of the mutations, the effect of the mutation on the T antigen amino acid sequence, and key references are included in the listing. The database is available from the authors as a Macintosh FileMaker Pro file, or as a hard copy printout.", "authors": ["Timothy D. Kierstead", "James M.
