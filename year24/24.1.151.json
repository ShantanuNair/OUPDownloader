We have added (if available) data on the androgen binding phenotype of the mutant AR, the clinical phenotype of the affected persons, the family history and whether the pathogenicity of a mutation has been proven. Exonic mutations are now listed in 5\u2032\u21923\u2032sequence regardless of type and single base pair changes are presented in codon context. Splice site and intronic mutations are listed separately. The database has allowed us to substantiate and amplify the observation of mutational hot spots within exons encoding the AR androgen binding domain. The database is available from EMBL ( ftp://www.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/androgen ) or as a Macintosh Filemaker file ( MC33@musica.mcgill.ca ) ", "authors": ["Bruce Gottlieb", "Mark Trifiro", "Rose Lumbroso", "D.
