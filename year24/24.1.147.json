{"keywords": ["mutation", "cancer", "tp53 gene", "tumor suppressor genes", "software"], "abstract": "A large number of different mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 gene have been identified in all types of cancer. As of September 1995, this database contains over 4200 mutations. This substantial increase since our previous report can enable epidemiological analyses which were not previously possible. In order to capture all these new data, the software permitting analysis has been improved. This report describes the various improvements since first release of the database.", "authors": ["Christophe B\u00e9roud", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Verdier", "Thierry Soussi"], "about": ["mutation", "cancer", "tp53 gene", "tumor suppressor genes", "software", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "P53 Gene Mutation: Software and Database\r\n "}
