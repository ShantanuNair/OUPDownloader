Each dataset consists of the changes in DNA sequence in the mutants, typically tens to hundreds, induced by mutagenesis of a particular cell line under specific conditions. The database is available on the Internet and on diskettes, and is periodically updated. Researchers are invited to submit additional data. A data entry program, MUTSIN, is available that diagrams each mutation on the computer screen as entered and alerts the user to any inconsistency between the entry and the wild type gene sequence.", "authors": ["Franklin Hutchinson", "J.
