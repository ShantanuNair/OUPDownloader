{"keywords": ["small nuclear rna"], "abstract": "The uRNADB provides aligned, annotated and phy-logenetically ordered sequences of the uRNAs. At the time of manuscript submission (August 1995) it contained sequences for U1 (78 sequences), U2 (80), U3 (20), U4 (38), U5 (37) and U6 (46). Additional uRNAs of interest will be available by the time you read this.", "authors": ["Christian Zwieb"], "about": ["small nuclear rna", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The uRNA Database\r\n "}
