{"keywords": ["glycoprotein", "glycosylation", "mammals", "mucins", "polysaccharides", "transferase"], "abstract": " O-GLYCBASE is a comprehensive database of information on glycoproteins and their O -linked glycosylationsites. Entries are compiled and revised from the SWISS-PROT and PIR databases as well as directly from recently published reports. Nineteen percent of the entries extracted from the databases needed revision with respect to O -linked glycosylation. Entries include information about species, sequence, glycosylation site and glycan type, and are fully referenced. Sequence logos displaying the acceptor specificity for the GalNAc transferase is shown. A neural network method for prediction of mucin type O -glycosylation sites in mammalian glycoproteins exclusively from the primary sequence is made available by E-mail or WWW. The O-GLYCBASE database is also available electronically through our WWW server or by anonymous FTP. ", "authors": ["Jan E. Hansen", "Ole Lund", "Jens O. Nielsen", "John-E. S.
