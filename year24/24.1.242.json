{"keywords": ["internet", "peptides", "sequence analysis", "affinity", "binding (molecular function)", "molecule"], "abstract": "MHCPEP is a curated database comprising over 6000 peptide sequences known to bind MHC molecules. Entries are compiled from published reports as well as from direct submissions of experimental data. Each entry contains peptide sequence, MHC specificity and when available, experimental method, observed activity, binding affinity, source protein, anchor positions, as well as publication references. The present format of the database allows text string matching searches but can easily be converted for use in conjunction with sequence analysis packages. The database can be accessed via Internet using Gopher, FTP or WWW", "authors": ["Vladimir Brusic", "George Rudy", "Anthony P. Kyne", "Leonard C.
