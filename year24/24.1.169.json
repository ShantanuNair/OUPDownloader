Information provided for each mutation includes: (i) a brief description of the phenotype(s) associated with each mutation, (ii) whether a mutant phenotype has been detected by in vivo or in vitro methods, and (iii) relevant literature citations. The database is available via ftp and on the World Wide Web. ", "authors": ["Kathleen L.
