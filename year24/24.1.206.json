{"keywords": ["internet", "trees (plant)", "protein data bank"], "abstract": " The FSSP database presents a continuously updated classification of 3-D protein folds based on an all-against-all comparison of structures currently in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [Bernstein et al. (1977) J. Mol. Biol. , 112, 535\u2013542]. The database currently contains an extended structural family for each of 600 representative protein chains which have <25% mutual sequence identity. The results of the exhaustive pairwise structure comparisons are reported in the form of a fold tree generated by hierachical clustering and as a series of structurally representative sets of folds at varying levels of uniqueness. For each query structure from the representative set, there is a database entry containing structure-structure alignments with its structural neighbours in the representative set and its sequence homologs in the PDB. All alignments are based purely on the 3-D co-ordinates of the proteins and are derived by an automatic structure comparison program (Dali). The FSSP database is accessible electronically on the World Wide Web and by anonymous ftp.
