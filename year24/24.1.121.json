It includes both molecular informations about the mutations and also clinical data about the patients. A software have been designed in order to analyse all these informations in the database.", "authors": ["Christophe B\u00e9roud", "Thierry Soussi"], "about": ["mutation", "colorectal cancer", "cell lines", "genes, apc", "software", "neoplasms", "mutation, somatic", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "APC Gene: Database of Germline and Somatic Mutations in Human Tumors and Cell Lines\r\n "}
