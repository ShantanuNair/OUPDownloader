The databases themselves are stand-alone dBase files and the software for analysis of the databases runs on IBM-compatible computers. The software created for these databases permits filtering, ordering, report generation and display of information in the database. In addition, a significant number of routines have been developed for the analysis of single base substitutions. One method of obtaining the databases and software is via the World Wide Web (WWW). Open home page http://sunsite.unc.edu/dnam/mainpage.html with a WWW browser. Alternatively, the databases and programs are available via public ftp from anonymous@sunsite.unc.edu . There is no password required to enter the system. The databases and software are found in subdirectory pub/academic/biology/dna-mutations . Two other programs are available at the WWW site, a program for comparison of mutational spectra and a program for entry of mutational data into a relational database. ", "authors": ["Neal F.
