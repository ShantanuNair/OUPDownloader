Ribonuclease P is a ribonucleoprotein, and in bacteria the RNA alone is capable of pre-tRNA processing in vitro , i.e. it is a catalytic RNA. The Ribonuclease P Database is a compilation of ribo-nuclease P sequences, sequence alignments, secondary structures, three-dimensional models and accessory information, in the form of a hypertext document available via the Worldwide Web.
