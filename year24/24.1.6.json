The EBI also maintains and distributes the SWISS-PROT Protein Sequence database, in collaboration with Amos Bairoch of the University of Geneva. Over fifty additional specialist molecular biology databases, as well as software and documentation of interest to molecular biologists are available. The EBI network services include database searching and sequence similarity searching facilities.", "authors": ["Patricia Rodriguez-Tom\u00e9", "Peter J. Stoehr", "Graham N. Cameron", "Tomas P.
