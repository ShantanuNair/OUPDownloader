Starting from the B.subtilis sequences available in the EMBL, GenBank and DDBJ collections we have removed all encountered duplications and then added extra annotations to the sequences (e.g. accession numbers for the genes, locations on the genetic map, codon usage, etc.) We have also added cross-references to the EMBL, MEDLINE, SWISS-PROT and ENZYME data banks. The present system results from merging of the NRSub and SubtiList databases and the sequence contigs used in the two systems are identical. NRSub is distributed as a flatfile in EMBL format (which is supported by most sequence analysis software packages) and as an ACNUC database, while SubtiList is distributed as a relational database under 4th Dimension. It is possible to access the data through two dedicated World Wide Web servers located in France and Japan.
