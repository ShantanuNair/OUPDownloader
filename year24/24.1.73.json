{"keywords": ["internet", "rna", "rna, small", "genbank"], "abstract": " The small RNA database is a compilation of all the small size RNA sequences available to date from prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. About 500 small RNA sequences are in our database currently. The sources of individual RNAs and their GenBank accession numbers are also included. The small RNA database can be accessed through the World Wide Web (WWW). Our WWW URL is http://mbcr.bcm.tmc.edu/smallRNA/smallrna.html . The new small RNA sequences published since our last compilation are listed in this paper.
