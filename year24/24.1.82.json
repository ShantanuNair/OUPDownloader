{"keywords": ["ribosomes", "ribosomal rna", "trees (plant)", "electronic mail", "dystonia 12"], "abstract": " The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) is a curated database that offers ribosome-related data, analysis services and associated computer programs. The offerings include phylogenetically ordered alignments of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences, derived phylogenetic trees, rRNA secondary structure diagrams and various software for handling, analyzing and displaying alignments and trees. The data are available via anonymous ftp ( http://rdp.life.uiuc.edu ), electronic mail ( server@rdp.life.uiuc.edu ), gopher ( rdpgopher.life.uiuc.edu rdpgopher.life. uiuc.edu) and World Wide Web (WWW) ( http://rdpwww.life.uiuc.edu/ ). The electronic mail and WWW servers provide ribosomal probe checking, screening for possible chimeric rRNA sequences, automated alignment and approximate phylogenetic placement of user-submitted sequences on an existing phylogenetic tree.
