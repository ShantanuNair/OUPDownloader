{"keywords": ["internet", "software", "enzymes", "cytokinesis"], "abstract": " REBASE is a comprehensive database of information about restriction enzymes and their associated methy-lases, including their recognition and cleavage sites and their commercial availability. Information from REBASE is available via monthly electronic mailings as well as via WAIS, anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web ( http://www.neb.com/rebase ). Specialized files are available that can be used directly by many software packages. ", "authors": ["Richard J.
