These proteins include transcription factors, proteins involved in signal transduction, and receptors. GRBase is now accessible via the World Wide Web ( http://www.access.digex.net/\u223cregulate ). A key feature of this database is the linking of each entry to data in other databases. The database is also available by anonymous ftp (URL http://ftp.trevigen.com/pub/Tfactors/ ) in both text and Filemaker pro formats.
