Unlike the previous updates of our E.coli databases, we provide the most recent version preferentially via the World Wide Web System (use URL: http://susi.bio.unigiessen.de/usr/local/www/html/ecdc.html ). Our database includes an assembled set of contiguous sequences. Each of these contigs compiles all available sequence information, including those derived from a variety of elder sequences. The organisation of the database allows one to find the exact physical location of each individual gene or regulatory region, even regarding discrepancies in nomenclature. The WWW program allows access into the original EMBL and SWISSPROT datafiles. A FASTA and BLAST search may be performed online. Besides the WWW format a flat file version may be obtained via ftp. The complete compilation, including a full set of genetic map data and the E.coli protein index, can be obtained in machine readable form from the EMBL data library as a part of the CD-ROM issue of the EMBL sequence database, released and updated every three months. After deletion of all detected overlaps a total of 3 333 878 individual bp was determined by the end of September 1995. This corresponds to a total of 71.71% of the entire E.coli chromosome consisting of about 4720 kbp. About 94 kbp (2%) are available additionally, but have not yet been definitely mapped.
