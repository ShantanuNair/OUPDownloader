{"keywords": ["cd-rom", "internet", "genbank"], "abstract": "The GenBank sequence database continues to expand its data coverage, quality control, annotation content and retrieval services. GenBank is comprised of DNA sequences submitted directly by authors as well as sequences from the other major public databases. An integrated retrieval system, known as Entrez, contains data from GenBank and from the major protein sequence and structural databases, as well as related MEDLINE abstracts. Users may access GenBank over the Internet through the World Wide Web and through special client-server programs for text and sequence similarity searching. FTP, CD-ROM and e-mail servers are alternate means of access.", "authors": ["Dennis A. Benson", "Mark Boguski", "David J.
