The 1380 patient entries are ordered by the nucleotide number of their mutation. Where known, details are given on factor IX activity, factor IX antigen in circulation and origin of mutation. References to published mutations are given and the laboratories generating the data are indicated.", "authors": ["F. Giannelli", "P. M. Green", "S. S. Sommer", "M.-C. Poon", "M. Ludwig", "R.
