{"keywords": ["metabolism", "internet", "enzymes", "genetics", "earth microbiome project"], "abstract": "The Enzymes and Metabolic Pathways database (EMP) is an encoding of the contents of over 10 000 original publications on the topics of enzymology and metabolism. This large body of information has been transformed into a queryable database. An extraction of over 1800 pictorial representations of metabolic pathways from this collection is freely available on the World Wide Web. We believe that this collection will play an important role in the interpretation of genetic sequence data, as well as offering a meaningful framework for the integration of many other forms of biological data.", "authors": ["Evgeni Selkov", "Svetlana Basmanova", "Terry Gaasterland", "Igor Goryanin", "Yuri Gretchkin", "Natalia Maltsev", "Valeri Nenashev", "Ross Overbeek", "Elena Panyushkina", "Lyudmila Pronevitch", "Evgeni Selkov, Jr", "Ilya Yunus"], "about": ["metabolism", "internet", "enzymes", "genetics", "earth microbiome project", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The Meolic Pathway Collection From Emp: The Enzymes and Metabolic Pathways Database\r\n "}
