The database also presents a review of the structure and function of factor VIII and the molecular genetics of haemophilia A, a real time update of the biostatistics of each parameter in the database, a molecular model of the A1, A2 and A3 domains of the factor VIII protein (based on the crystal structure of caeruloplasmin) and a bulletin board for discussion of issues in the molecular biology of factor VIII.", "authors": ["Adam I.
