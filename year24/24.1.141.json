This database, updated twice a year, now contains records on 4496 published mutations (July 1995 release) and can be obtained from the EMBL Outstation-the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) through the network or on CD-ROM. This report describes the criteria for inclusion of data in this database, a description of the current format and a brief discussion of the current relevance of p53 mutation analysis to clinical and biological questions.
