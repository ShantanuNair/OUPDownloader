{"keywords": ["genetic disorder", "dna", "homeodomain proteins", "internet", "united states national institutes of health", "datasets"], "abstract": " The Homeodomain Resource is a searchable, curated collection of information for the homeodomain protein family. The resource is organized in a compact form and provides user-friendly interfaces for both querying the component databases and assembling customized datasets. The current release (version 5.0, October 2002) contains 1056 full-length homeodomain-containing sequences, 37 experimentally-derived structures, 81 homeodomain interactions, 84 homeodomain DNA-binding sites and 114 homeodomain proteins implicated in human genetic disorders. A new feature of this new release is the inclusion of experimentally-derived protein\u2013protein interaction data for homeodomain family members. All entries are cross-linked for easy retrieval of the original records from source databases. The Homeodomain Resource is freely available through the World Wide Web at http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/homeodomain/ . ", "authors": ["Sharmila Banerjee-Basu", "Travis Moreland", "Benjamin J.
