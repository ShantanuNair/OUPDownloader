The past two years have seen a significant expansion in the biological scope of WormBase, including the integration of large-scale, genome-wide data sets, the inclusion of genome sequence and gene predictions from related species and active literature curation. This expansion of data has also driven the development and refinement of user interfaces and operability, including a new Genome Browser, new searches and facilities for data access and the inclusion of extensive documentation. These advances have expanded WormBase beyond the obvious target audience of C. elegans researchers, to include researchers wishing to explore problems in functional and comparative genomics within the context of a powerful genetic system.
