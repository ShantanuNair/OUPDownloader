{"keywords": ["genome", "internet", "microsatellite repeats", "genbank", "use techniques of reflection and clarification in communication"], "abstract": " The MICdb ( Mic rosatellites D ata b ase) ( http://www.cdfd.org.in/micas ) is a comprehensive relational database of non-redundant microsatellites extracted from fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes. The current version (1.0) of the database has been compiled from 83 genomes belonging to different phylogenetic groups. This database has been linked to MICAS, the web-based Mic rostatellite A nalysis S erver. MICAS provides a user-friendly front-end to systematically extract data on microsatellite tracts from genomes. The database contains the following information pertaining to the microsatellites: the regions (coding/non-coding, if coding, their GenBank annotations) containing microsatellite tracts; the frequencies of their occurrences, the size and the number of repeating motifs; and the sequences of the tracts. MICAS also provides an interface to Autoprimer, a primer design program to automatically design primers for selected microsatellite loci. ", "authors": ["Vattipally B.
