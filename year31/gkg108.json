Structured fields for expression patterns have been introduced for transcription factors from human and mouse, using the CYTOMER \u00ae database on anatomical structures and developmental stages. The functionality of Match\u2122, a tool for matrix-based search of transcription factor binding sites, has been enhanced. For instance, the program now comes along with a number of tissue-(or state-)specific profiles and new profiles can be created and modified with Match\u2122 Profiler. The GENE table was extended and gained in importance, containing amongst others links to LocusLink, RefSeq and OMIM now. Further, (direct) links between factor and target gene on one hand and between gene and encoded factor on the other hand were introduced. The TRANSFAC \u00ae public release is available at http://www.gene-regulation.com . For yeast an additional release including the latest data was made available separately as TRANSFAC \u00aeSaccharomyces Module (TSM) at http://transfac.gbf.de . For CYTOMER \u00ae free download versions are available at http://www.biobase.de:8080/index.html . ", "authors": ["V. Matys", "E. Fricke", "R. Geffers", "E. G\u00f6\u00dfling", "M. Haubrock", "R.
