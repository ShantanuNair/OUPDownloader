The 10th \u2018jubilee release\u2019 of the SBASE library of protein domain sequences contains 1\u2005052\u2005904 protein sequence segments annotated by structure, function, ligand-binding or cellular topology, clustered into over 6000 domain groups. Domain identification and functional prediction are based on a comparison of BLAST search outputs with a knowledge base of biologically significant similarities extracted from known domain groups. The knowledge base is generated automatically for each domain group from the comparison of within-group (\u2018self\u2019) and out-of-group (\u2018non-self\u2019) similarities. This is a memory-based approach wherein group-specific similarity functions are automatically learned from the database.
