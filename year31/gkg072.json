Several sequencing projects devoted to T. gondii have been completed or are in progress: an EST project ( http://genome.wustl.edu/est/index.php?toxoplasma=1 ), a BAC clone end-sequencing project ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_gondii/ ) and an 8X random shotgun genomic sequencing project ( http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/tga1/ ). ToxoDB was designed to provide a central point of access for all available T. gondii data, and a variety of data mining tools useful for the analysis of unfinished, un-annotated draft sequence during the early phases of the genome project. In later stages, as more and different types of data become available (microarray, proteomic, SNP, QTL, etc.) the database will provide an integrated data analysis platform facilitating user-defined queries across the different data types.
