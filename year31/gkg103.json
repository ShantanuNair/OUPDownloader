{"keywords": ["mutation", "heterogeneity", "information systems", "ligands", "sequence alignment", "g-protein-coupled receptors"], "abstract": " The GPCRDB is a molecular class-specific information system that collects, combines, validates and disseminates heterogeneous data on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The database stores data on sequences, ligand binding constants and mutations. The system also provides computationally derived data such as sequence alignments, homology models, and a series of query and visualization tools. The GPCRDB is updated automatically once every 4\u20135 months and is freely accessible at http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/ .
