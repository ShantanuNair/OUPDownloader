{"keywords": ["functional genomics", "consensus sequence", "rna, messenger", "mice", "genbank", "molecule"], "abstract": " The Adenylate Uridylate (AU)-Rich Element Database, ARED-mRNA version 2.0, contains information not present in the previous ARED. This includes additional data entries, new information and links to Unigene, LocusLink, RefSeq records and mouse homologue data. An ARE consensus sequence specific to the 3\u2032UTR is the basis of ARED that demonstrated two important findings: (i) AREs are present in a large, previously unrecognized set of human mRNAs; and (ii) ARE-mRNAs encode proteins of diverse functions which are largely involved in early and transient biological responses. In this update, we have modified the strategy for identifying ARE-mRNA in order to systematically deal with inconsistencies of molecule type and mRNA region in GenBank records. Potential uses for the ARED in functional genomics are also given. The database is accessible via the web, http://rc.kfshrc.edu.sa/ared , with a new querying system that allows searching ARE-mRNAs by any public database identifier or name. The ARED website also contains relevant links to uses for the ARED. ", "authors": ["Tala Bakheet", "Bryan R. G. Williams", "Khalid S. A.
