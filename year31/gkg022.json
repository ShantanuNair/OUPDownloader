Started at the Real World Computing Partnership (RWCP) in August 1997, it developed to the present system of PDB-REPRDB. In April 2001, the system was moved to the Computational Biology Research Center (CBRC), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) ( http://www.cbrc.jp/ ); it is available at http://www.cbrc.jp/pdbreprdb/ . The current database includes 33\u2005368 protein chains from 16\u2005682 PDB entries (1 September, 2002), from which are excluded (a) DNA and RNA data, (b) theoretically modeled data, (c) short chains (1<40 residues), or (d) data with non-standard amino acid residues at all residues.
