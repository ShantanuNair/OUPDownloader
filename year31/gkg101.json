{"keywords": ["amino acids", "databases", "cell nucleus", "leucine", "consensus"], "abstract": " Protein export from the nucleus is often mediated by a Leucine-rich Nuclear Export Signal (NES). NESbase is a database of experimentally validated Leucine-rich NESs curated from literature. These signals are not annotated in databases such as SWISS-PROT, PIR or PROSITE. Each NESbase entry contains information of whether NES was shown to be necessary and/or sufficient for export, and whether the export was shown to be mediated by the export receptor CRM1. The compiled information was used to make a sequence logo of the Leucine-rich NESs, displaying the conservation of amino acids within a window of 25 residues. Surprisingly, only 36% of the sequences used for the logo fit the widely accepted NES consensus L-x(2,3)-[LIVFM]-x(2,3)-L-x-[LI]. The database is available online at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/NESbase/ . ", "authors": ["Tanja la Cour", "Ramneek Gupta", "Kristoffer Rapacki", "Karen Skriver", "Flemming M.
