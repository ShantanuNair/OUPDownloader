Motivated by this assumption we have delineated a catalogue of conserved non-coding sequence blocks and provide the CORG\u2014\u2018COmparative Regulatory Genomics\u2019\u2014database. The data were computed based on statistically significant local suboptimal alignments of 15\u2005kb regions upstream of the translation start sites of, currently, 10\u2005793 pairs of orthologous genes. The resulting conserved non-coding blocks were annotated with EST matches for easier detection of non-coding mRNA and with hits to known transcription factor binding sites. CORG data are accessible from the ENSEMBL web site via a DAS service as well as a specially developed web service ( http://corg.molgen.mpg.de ) for query and interactive visualization of the conserved blocks and their annotation.
