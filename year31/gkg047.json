MGD strives to provide an extensively integrated information resource with experimental details annotated from both literature and on-line genomic data sources. MGD curates and presents the consensus representation of genotype (sequence) to phenotype information including highly detailed information about genes and gene products. Primary foci of integration are through representations of relationships between genes, sequences and phenotypes. MGD collaborates with other bioinformatics groups to curate a definitive set of information about the laboratory mouse. Recent developments include a general implementation of database structures for controlled vocabularies and the integration of a phenotype classification system. ", "authors": ["Judith A.
