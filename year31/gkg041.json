The first release (2002.01) of PlantProm DB contains 305 entries including 71, 220 and 14 promoters from monocot, dicot and other plants, respectively. It provides DNA sequence of the promoter regions (\u2212200\u2005:\u2005+51) with TSS on the fixed position +201, taxonomic/promoter type classification of promoters and Nucleotide Frequency Matrices (NFM) for promoter elements: TATA-box, CCAAT-box and TSS-motif (Inr). Analysis of TSS-motifs revealed that their composition is different in dicots and monocots, as well as for TATA and TATA-less promoters. The database serves as learning set in developing plant promoter prediction programs. One such program (TSSP) based on discriminant analysis has been created by Softberry Inc. and the application of a support ftp: vector machine approach for promoter identification is under development. PlantProm DB is available at http://mendel.cs.rhul.ac.uk/ and http://www.softberry.com/ . ", "authors": ["Ilham A. Shahmuradov", "Alex J. Gammerman", "John M. Hancock", "Peter M. Bramley", "Victor V.
