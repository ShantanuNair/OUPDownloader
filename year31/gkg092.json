WorfDB serves as a central data repository enabling the scientific community to search for availability and quality of cloned ORFs. So far, ORF sequence tags (OSTs) obtained for all individual clones have allowed exon structure corrections for \u223c3400 ORFs originally predicted by the C. elegans sequencing consortium. In addition, we now have OSTs for \u223c4300 predicted genes for which no ESTs were available. The database contains this OST information along with data pertinent to the cloning process. WorfDB could serve as a model database for other metazoan ORFeome cloning projects.
