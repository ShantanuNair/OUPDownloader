{"keywords": ["mutation", "internet", "receptors, nuclear", "academia (organization)"], "abstract": " The NRMD is a database for nuclear receptor mutation information. It includes mutation information from SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL, several web-based mutation data resources, and data extracted from the literature in a fully automatic manner. Because it is also possible to add mutations manually, a hundred mutations were added for completeness. At present, the NRMD contains information about 893 mutations in 54 nuclear receptors. A common numbering scheme for all nuclear receptors eases the use of the information for many kinds of studies. The NRMD is freely available to academia and industry as a stand-alone version at: www.receptors.org/NR/ . ", "authors": ["Joost J.
