{"keywords": ["chromosomes, human", "genes", "genome, human", "smell perception"], "abstract": " Recent enhancements and current research in the GeneCards (GC) ( http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards/ ) project are described, including the addition of gene expression profiles and integrated gene locations. Also highlighted are the contributions of specialized associated human gene-centric databases developed at the Weizmann Institute. These include the Unified Database (UDB) ( http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/udb ) for human genome mapping, the human Chromosome 21 database at the Weizmann Insti-tute (CroW 21) ( http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/crow21 ), and the Human Olfactory Receptor Data Explora-torium (HORDE) ( http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/HORDE ). The synergistic relationships amongst these efforts have positively impacted the quality, quantity and usefulness of the GeneCards gene compendium.
