Experimental details are synthesized for efficient use by the community and organized into two major sections in the database, one dealing with genes and the other with mutant alleles. The database can be queried for detailed information on a single gene to create a SeedGenes Profile. Queries can also generate lists of genes or mutants that fit specified criteria. The long-term goal is to establish a complete collection of Arabidopsis genes that give a knockout phenotype. This information is needed to focus attention on genes with important cellular functions in a model plant and to assess from a genetic perspective the extent of functional redundancy in the Arabidopsis genome.
