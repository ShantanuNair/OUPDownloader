It contains published and unpublished references, recognition and cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, crystal and sequence data. Homing endonucleases are also included. REBASE contains the most complete and up-to-date information about the methylation sensitivity of restriction endonucleases. In addition, there is extensive information about the known and putative restriction-modification (R-M) systems in more than 100 sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes. The data is available on the web ( http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html ), through ftp ( ftp.neb.com ) and as monthly updates via email. ", "authors": ["Richard J.
