{"keywords": ["genome", "genomics"], "abstract": " The PEDANT genome database ( http://pedant.gsf.de ) provides exhaustive automatic analysis of genomic sequences by a large variety of established bioinformatics tools through a comprehensive Web-based user interface. One hundred and seventy seven completely sequenced and unfinished genomes have been processed so far, including large eukaryotic genomes (mouse, human) published recently. In this contribution, we describe the current status of the PEDANT database and novel analytical features added to the PEDANT server in 2002. Those include: (i) integration with the BioRS\u2122 data retrieval system which allows fast text queries, (ii) pre-computed sequence clusters in each complete genome, (iii) a comprehensive set of tools for genome comparison, including genome comparison tables and protein function prediction based on genomic context, and (iv) computation and visualization of protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) networks based on experimental data. The availability of functional and structural predictions for 650\u2005000 genomic proteins in well organized form makes PEDANT a useful resource for both functional and structural genomics.
