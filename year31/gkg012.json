For each structure, RNABase contains a brief summary as well as annotation of conformational parameters, identification of possible model errors, Ramachandran-style conformational maps and classification of ribonucleotides into conformers. These same analyses can also be performed on structures submitted by users. To facilitate access, structures are automatically placed into a variety of functional and structural categories, including: ribozymes, pseudoknots, etc. RNABase can be freely accessed on the web at http://www.rnabase.org . We are committed to maintaining this database indefinitely. ", "authors": ["Venkatesh L. Murthy", "George D.
