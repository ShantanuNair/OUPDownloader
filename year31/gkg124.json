The RNAs included in the database form very heterogenous group of molecules that act on different levels of information transmission in the cell. It includes RNAs acting on the level of chromatin structure, transcriptional and translational regulation of gene expression, modulation of protein function and regulation of subcellular distribution of RNAs and proteins. Those RNAs, with potential regulatory functions have been identified in prokaryotic, animal and plant cells. The database can be accessed at http://biobases.ibch.poznan.pl/ncRNA/ .
