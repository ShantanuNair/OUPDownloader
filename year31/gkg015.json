{"keywords": ["engineering", "esterase", "substrate specificity", "trees (plant)", "enzymes", "lipase"], "abstract": " The Lipase Engineering Database (LED) ( http://www.led.uni-stuttgart.de ) integrates information on sequence, structure, and function of lipases, esterases, and related proteins. Sequence data on 806 protein entries are assigned to 38 homologous families, which are grouped into 16 superfamilies with no global sequence similarity between each other. For each family, multisequence alignments are provided with functionally relevant residues annotated. Pre-calculated phylogenetic trees allow navigation inside superfamilies. Experimental structures of 45 proteins are superposed and consistently annotated. The LED has been applied to systematically analyze sequence\u2013structure\u2013function relationships of this vast and diverse enzyme class. It is a useful tool to identify functionally relevant residues apart from the active site residues, and to design mutants with desired substrate specificity.
