{"keywords": ["cereals", "avian crop", "genes", "genome", "genomics", "rice", "information resources"], "abstract": " The MIPS Rice ( Oryza sativa ) database (MOsDB; http://mips.gsf.de/proj/rice ) provides a comprehensive data collection dedicated to the genome information of rice. Rice ( O. sativa L.) is one of the most important food crops for over half the world's population and serves as a major model system in cereal genome research. MOsDB integrates data from two publicly available rice genomic sequences, O. sativa L. ssp. indica and O. sativa L. ssp. japonica. Besides regularly updated rice genome sequence information, MOsDB provides an integrated resource for associated analysis data, e.g. internal and external annotation information as well as a complex characterization of all annotated rice genes. The MOsDB web interface supports various search options and allows browsing the database content. MOsDB is continuously expanding to include an increasing range of data type and the growing amount of information on the rice genome. ", "authors": ["Wojciech M.
