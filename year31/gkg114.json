It contains sequence types and details of several thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy, \u0394 H ; entropy, \u0394 S ; Gibbs free energy, \u0394 G ; melting temperature,  T m ), experimental models and methods for extracting thermodynamic parameters, buffer conditions as well as all relevant literature information. In addition, the database statistics and references related to NTDB are included. Information on normal and modified nucleobases and nucleosides are collected in a new section \u2018Nucleoside\u2019 whereby data collected thus far will be release in NTDB 2.0. The NTDB is freely available at http://ntdb.chem.cuhk.edu.hk .
