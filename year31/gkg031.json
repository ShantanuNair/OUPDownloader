Our objectives were to develop a specialist site to gather updated information on mutations responsible for hereditary inflammatory disorders: i.e. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), TRAPS (TNF Receptor 1A Associated Syndrome), HIDS (HyperIgD Syndrome), MWS (Muckle-Wells Syndrome)/FCU (Familial Cold Urticaria)/CINCA (Chronic Infantile Neurological Cutaneous and Articular Syndrome). Contributors submit their novel mutations through a 3 step form. Depending on the disease concerned, a member of the editorial board is automatically solicited to overview and validate new submissions, via a special secured web interface. If accepted, the new mutation is available on the INFEVERS web site and the discoverer, who is informed by email, is credited by having his/her name and date of the discovery on the site. The INFEVERS gateway provides researchers and clinicians with a common access location for information on similar diseases, allowing a rapid overview of the corresponding genetic defects at a glance. Furthermore, it is interactive and extendable according to the latest genes discovered.
