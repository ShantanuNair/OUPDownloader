GOBASE release 6 (summer 2002) contains over 130\u2005000 mitochondrial sequences, an increase of 37% over the previous release, and more than 30\u2005000 chloroplast sequences in a new auxiliary database. To handle this flood of new data, we have designed and implemented GOpop, a Java system for population and verification of the database. We have also implemented a more powerful and flexible user interface using the PHP programming language. http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/gobase/gobase.html.", "authors": ["Emmet A.
