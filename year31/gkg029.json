{"keywords": ["alternative splicing", "exons", "genes", "genome", "genomics", "protein isoforms", "rna, messenger", "community"], "abstract": " Recently, genomics analyses have demonstrated that alternative splicing is widespread in mammalian genomes (30\u201360% of genes reported to have multiple isoforms), and may be one of their most important mechanisms of functional regulation. However, by comparison with other genomics data such as genome annotation, SNPs, or gene expression, there exists relatively little database infrastructure for the study of alternative splicing. We have constructed an online database ASAP (the Alternative Splicing Annotation Project) for biologists to access and mine the enormous wealth of alternative splicing information coming from genomics and proteomics. ASAP is based on genome-wide analyses of alternative splicing in human (30\u2005793 alternative splice relationships found) from detailed alignment of expressed sequences onto the genomic sequence. ASAP provides precise gene exon\u2013intron structure, alternative splicing, tissue specificity of alternative splice forms, and protein isoform sequences resulting from alternative splicing. Moreover, it can help biologists design probe sequences for distinguishing specific mRNA isoforms. ASAP is intended to be a community resource for collaborative annotation of alternative splice forms, their regulation, and biological functions. The URL for ASAP is http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/ASAP .
