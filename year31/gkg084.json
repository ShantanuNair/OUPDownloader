{"keywords": ["amino acids", "databases", "crystallography", "internet", "molecular conformation", "clients", "protein data bank", "datasets"], "abstract": " Conformation Angles DataBase (CADB) provides an online resource to access data on conformation angles (both main-chain and side-chain) of protein structures in two data sets corresponding to 25% and 90% sequence identity between any two proteins, available in the Protein Data Bank. In addition, the database contains the necessary crystallographic parameters. The package has several flexible options and display facilities to visualize the main-chain and side-chain conformation angles for a particular amino acid residue. The package can also be used to study the interrelationship between the main-chain and side-chain conformation angles. A web based JAVA graphics interface has been deployed to display the user interested information on the client machine. The database is being updated at regular intervals and can be accessed over the World Wide Web interface at the following URL:\u2005 http://144.16.71.148/cadb/ . ", "authors": ["S. S. Sheik", "P.
