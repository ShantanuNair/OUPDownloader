The PDB Homologs page provides structural information from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) about yeast proteins and/or their homologs. SGD has also created a resource that utilizes the eMOTIF database for motif information about a given protein. A third new resource is the Protein Information page, which contains protein physical and chemical properties, such as molecular weight and hydropathicity scores, predicted from the translated ORF sequence.
