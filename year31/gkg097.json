{"keywords": ["phenotype", "mutation", "familial mediterranean fever", "genotype", "quality control", "homogeneity"], "abstract": " We present here the MetaFMF database (freely accessible at http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/metaFMF/index_us.html ) that attempts to gather and unify, in a common resource, data on phenotype\u2013genotype correlation in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). A single accession form, including a large number of quality controls, has been implemented such that data, collected worldwide, are included in an homogeneous manner. The inclusion criterion has the objective to avoid interpretational bias: patients will be included only if they bear at least two mutations. The clinical form has been set up by an International editorial board (12 FMF expert centres), which guarantees the validity of the data. Data are anonymous and submitted by a secure interface, in which the researcher is logged in with a specific ID and password. A pilot study on 211 patients has shown the feasibility and relevance of this project. We anticipate that the use of MetaFMF will enable reliable assessment of phenotype\u2013genotype correlations in FMF, and define a set of severe versus mild mutations/genotypes. It should also highlight reasons for previous inconsistencies in such correlations.
