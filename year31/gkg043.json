{"keywords": ["frequency", "personal integrity"], "abstract": " Elaboration of ALFRED ( http://alfred.med.yale.edu ) is being continued in two directions. One of which is developing tools for efficiently annotating the entries and checking the integrity of the data already in the database while the other is to increase the quantity and accessibility of data. Information contained in ALFRED such as, polymorphic sites, number of populations and frequency tables (one sample typed for one site) has significantly increased. ", "authors": ["H. Rajeevan", "M.
