IMGT provides a common access to standardized data which include nucleotide and protein sequences, oligonucleotide primers, gene maps, genetic polymorphisms, specificities, 2D and 3D structures. IMGT includes three sequence databases (IMGT/LIGM-DB, IMGT/MHC-DB, IMGT/PRIMER-DB), one genome database (IMGT/GENE-DB) with different interfaces (IMGT/GeneSearch, IMGT/GeneView, IMGT/LocusView), one 3D structure database (IMGT/3Dstructure-DB), Web resources comprising 8000 HTML pages (\u2018IMGT Marie-Paule page\u2019) and interactive tools for sequence analysis (IMGT/V-QUEST, IMGT/JunctionAnalysis, IMGT/Allele-Align, IMGT/PhyloGene). IMGT data are expertly annotated according to the rules of the IMGT Scientific chart, based on IMGT-ONTOLOGY. IMGT tools are particularly useful for the analysis of the IG and TR repertoires in physiological normal and pathological situations. IMGT has important applications in medical research (autoimmune diseases, AIDS, leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas), biotechnology related to antibody engineering (phage displays, combinatorial libraries) and thera-peutic approaches (graft, immunotherapy). IMGT is freely available at http://imgt.cines.fr .
