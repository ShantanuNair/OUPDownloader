The present version focuses on pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa . PRODORIC links data on environmental stimuli with trans -acting transcription factors, cis -acting promoter elements and regulon definition. Interactive graphical representations of operon, gene and promoter structures including regulator-binding sites, transcriptional and translational start sites, supplemented with information on regulatory proteins are available at varying levels of detail. The data collection provided is based on exhaustive analyses of scientific literature and computational sequence prediction. Included within PRODORIC are tools to define and predict regulator binding sites. It is accessible at http://prodoric.tu-bs.de .
