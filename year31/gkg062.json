{"keywords": ["functional genomics", "catheterization"], "abstract": " The CATH database of protein domain structures ( http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath_new ) currently contains 34\u2005287 domain structures classified into 1383 superfamilies and 3285 sequence families. Each structural family is expanded with domain sequence relatives recruited from GenBank using a variety of efficient sequence search protocols and reliable thresholds. This extended resource, known as the CATH-protein family database (CATH-PFDB) contains a total of 310\u2005000 domain sequences classified into 26\u2005812 sequence families. New sequence search protocols have been designed, based on these intermediate sequence libraries, to allow more regular updating of the classification. ", "authors": ["F. M. G. Pearl", "C. F.
