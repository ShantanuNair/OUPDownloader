Colour-code based tables reporting the different genetic origin of identified genes allow hyper-textual link to single entries. Promoter sequences identified for tRNA genes in the mitochondrial genomes of Angiospermae are also reported. The PLMItRNA database is accessible at http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/PLMItRNA/ .
