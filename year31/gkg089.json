The integration with TRANSFAC \u00ae , a database about transcription factors and their DNA binding sites, provides the possibility to obtain complete signaling pathways from ligand to target genes and their products, which may themselves be involved in regulatory action. As of July 2002, the TRANSPATH Professional release 3.2 contains about 9800 molecules, >1800 genes and >11\u2005400 reactions collected from \u223c5000 references. With the ArrayAnalyzer\u2122, an integrated tool has been developed for evaluation of microarray data. It uses the TRANSPATH data set to identify key regulators in pathways connected with up- or down-regulated genes of the respective array. The key molecules and their surrounding networks can be viewed with the PathwayBuilder\u2122, a tool that offers four different modes of visualization. More information on TRANSPATH is available at http://www.biobase.de/pages/products/databases.html .
