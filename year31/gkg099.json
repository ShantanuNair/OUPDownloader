{"keywords": ["glycoprotein", "cell lines", "polysaccharides"], "abstract": " GlycoSuiteDB is an annotated and curated relational database of glycan structures reported in the literature. It contains information on the glycan type, core type, linkages and anomeric configurations, mass, composition and the analytical methods used by the researchers to determine the glycan structure. Native and recombinant sources are detailed, including species, tissue and/or cell type, cell line, strain, life stage, disease, and if known the protein to which the glycan structures are attached. There are links to SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL and PubMed where applicable. Recent developments include the implementation of searching by 2D structure and substructure, disease and reference. The database is updated twice a year, and now contains over 7650 entries. Access to GlycoSuiteDB is available at http://www.glycosuite.com . ", "authors": ["Catherine A. Cooper", "Hiren J.
