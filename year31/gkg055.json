The Arabidopsis genome was searched for com-ponents of the mitochondrial protein import apparatus using components from the well-characterized model system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Twenty six homologues of 34 components could be found, encompassing the essential components for the general and carrier import pathways. The database is available through the Internet at http://millar3.biochem.uwa.edu.au/~lister/index.html . ", "authors": ["Ryan Lister", "Monika W.
