Beside this broad impact volatiles have in nature, scents are also widely used in pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries, so the identification of new scents is of great industrial interest. Despite this importance as well as the vast number and diversity of volatile compounds, there is currently no comprehensive public database providing information on structure and chemical classification of volatiles. Therefore, the database SuperScent was established to supply users with detailed information on the variety of odor components. The version of the database presented here comprises the 2D/3D structures of approximately 2100 volatiles and around 9200 synonyms as well as physicochemical properties, commercial availability and references. The volatiles are classified according to their origin, functionality and odorant groups. The information was extracted from the literature and web resources. SuperScent offers several search options, e.g. name, Pubchem ID number, species, functional groups, or molecular weight.
