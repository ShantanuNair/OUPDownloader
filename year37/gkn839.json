Kinetic Data of Bio-molecular Interaction database (KDBI) has been developed to provide information about experimentally determined kinetic data of protein\u2013protein, protein\u2013nucleic acid, protein\u2013ligand, nucleic acid\u2013ligand binding or reaction events described in the literature. To accommodate increasing demand for studying and simulating biological systems, numerous improvements and updates have been made to KDBI, including new ways to access data by pathway and molecule names, data file in System Biology Markup Language format, more efficient search engine, access to published parameter sets of simulation models of 63 pathways, and 2.3-fold increase of data (19 263 entries of 10 532 distinctive biomolecular binding and 11 954 interaction events, involving 2635 proteins/protein complexes, 847 nucleic acids, 1603 small molecules and 45 multi-step processes). KDBI is publically available at http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/kdbi/kdbi.asp.", "authors": ["Pankaj Kumar", "B. C. Han", "Z. Shi", "J. Jia", "Y. P. Wang", "Y. T. Zhang", "L. Liang", "Q. F. Liu", "Z. L.
