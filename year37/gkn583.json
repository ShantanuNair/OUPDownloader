The database currently contains 27 367 polymorphisms, including >3700 indels (insertions/deletions), covering all major chromsomes. These SNPs are clustered into 2238 markers, which are evenly distributed with an average density of one marker every 50.3 kb or 6.6 genes. SNPs were identified automatically, filtered for high quality and partly manually curated. The database provides detailed information on the SNP data including molecular and cytological locations (genome Releases 3\u20135), alleles of up to five commonly used laboratory stocks, flanking sequences, SNP marker amplification primers, quality scores and genotyping assays. Data specific for a certain region, particular stocks or a certain genome assembly version are easily retrievable through the interface of a publicly accessible website (http://flysnp.imp.ac.at/flysnpdb.php).", "authors": ["Doris Chen", "J\u00fcrg Berger", "Michaela Fellner", "Takashi Suzuki"], "about": ["alleles", "polymorphism", "cytology", "drosophila melanogaster", "genes", "genome", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "genotype determination", "amplification", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "FLYSNPdb: a high-density SNP database of Drosophila melanogaster\n "}
