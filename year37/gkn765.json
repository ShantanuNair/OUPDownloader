{"keywords": ["base sequence", "nucleotides", "high-velocity thrust technique", "datasets", "bioinformatics"], "abstract": "Dramatic increases in the throughput of nucleotide sequencing machines, and the promise of ever greater performance, have thrust bioinformatics into the era of petabyte-scale data sets. Sequence repositories, which provide the feed for these data sets into the worldwide computational infrastructure, are challenged by the impact of these data volumes. The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl), comprising the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database and the Ensembl Trace Archive, has identified challenges in the storage, movement, analysis, interpretation and visualization of petabyte-scale data sets. We present here our new repository for next generation sequence data, a brief summary of contents of the ENA and provide details of major developments to submission pipelines, high-throughput rule-based validation infrastructure and data integration approaches.", "authors": ["Guy Cochrane", "Ruth Akhtar", "James Bonfield", "Lawrence Bower", "Fehmi Demiralp", "Nadeem Faruque", "Richard Gibson", "Gemma Hoad", "Tim Hubbard", "Christopher Hunter", "Mikyung Jang", "Szilveszter Juhos", "Rasko Leinonen", "Steven Leonard", "Quan Lin", "Rodrigo Lopez", "Dariusz Lorenc", "Hamish McWilliam", "Gaurab Mukherjee", "Sheila Plaister", "Rajesh Radhakrishnan", "Stephen Robinson", "Siamak Sobhany", "Petra Ten Hoopen", "Robert Vaughan", "Vadim Zalunin", "Ewan Birney"], "about": ["base sequence", "nucleotides", "high-velocity thrust technique", "datasets", "bioinformatics", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Petabyte-scale innovations at the European Nucleotide Archive\r\n "}
