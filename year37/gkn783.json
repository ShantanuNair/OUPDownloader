The flexible PAZAR schema permits the representation of diverse information derived from experiments ranging from biochemical protein\u2013DNA binding to cellular reporter gene assays. Data collections can be made available to the public, or restricted to specific system users. The data \u2018boutiques\u2019 within the shopping-mall-inspired system facilitate the analysis of genomics data and the creation of predictive models of gene regulation. Since its initial release, PAZAR has grown in terms of data, features and through the addition of an associated package of software tools called the ORCA toolkit (ORCAtk). ORCAtk allows users to rapidly develop analyses based on the information stored in the PAZAR system. PAZAR is available at http://www.pazar.info. ORCAtk can be accessed through convenient buttons located in the PAZAR pages or via our website at http://www.cisreg.ca/ORCAtk.", "authors": ["Elodie Portales-Casamar", "David Arenillas", "Jonathan Lim", "Magdalena I.
