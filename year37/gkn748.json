Such a database is needed so that researchers have an easy way to access all the available association study data relevant to their genes, genome regions or diseases of interest. Such a depository will allow true positive signals to be more readily distinguished from false positives (type I error) that fail to consistently replicate. In this paper we describe how HGVbaseG2P has been constructed, and how its data are gathered and organized. We present a range of user-friendly but powerful website tools for searching, browsing and visualizing G2P study findings. HGVbaseG2P is available at http://www.hgvbaseg2p.org.", "authors": ["Gudmundur A. Thorisson", "Owen Lancaster", "Robert C. Free", "Robert K. Hastings", "Pallavi Sarmah", "Debasis Dash", "Samir K.
