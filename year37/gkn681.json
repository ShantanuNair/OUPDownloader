It currently incorporates sequences and annotation for S. mansoni in a single user-friendly database. Several genomic scale analyses are available as well as ESTs, oligonucleotides, metabolic pathways and drugs. In this article, we describe the data sets and its analyses, how to query the database and tools available in the website.", "authors": ["Adhemar Zerlotini", "Mark Heiges", "Haiming Wang", "Romulo L.
