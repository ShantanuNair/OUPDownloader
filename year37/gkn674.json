{"keywords": ["genes", "genome", "genomics", "streptococcus"], "abstract": "Streptococci are the causative agent of many human infectious diseases including bacterial pneumonia and meningitis. Here, we present Strepto-DB, a database for the comparative genome analysis of group A (GAS) and group B (GBS) streptococci. The known genomes of various GAS and GBS contain a large fraction of distributed genes that were found absent in other strains or serotypes of the same species. Strepto-DB identifies the homologous proteins deduced from the genomes of interest. It allows for the elucidation of the GAS and GBS core- and pan-genomes via genome-wide comparisons. Moreover, an intergenic region analysis tool provides alignments and predictions for transcription factor binding sites in the non-coding sequences. An interactive genome browser visualizes functional annotations. Strepto-DB (http://oger.tu-bs.de/strepto_db) was created by the use of OGeR, the Open Genome Resource for comparative analysis of prokaryotic genomes. OGeR is a newly developed open source database and tool platform for the web-based storage, distribution, visualization and comparison of prokaryotic genome data. The system automatically creates the dedicated relational database and web interface and imports an arbitrary number of genomes derived from standardized genome files. OGeR can be downloaded at http://oger.tu-bs.de.", "authors": ["Johannes Klein", "Richard M\u00fcnch", "Ilona Biegler", "Isam Haddad", "Ida Retter", "Dieter Jahn"], "about": ["genes", "genome", "genomics", "streptococcus", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Strepto-DB, a database for comparative genomics of group A (GAS) and B (GBS) streptococci, implemented with the novel database platform \u2018Open Genome Resource\u2019 (OGeR)\r\n "}
