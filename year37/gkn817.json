Exciting progress has been made in recent years in the application of these techniques in basic biomedical research and therapeutic development. However, it remains a difficult task to design effective siRNA experiments with high efficacy and specificity. We present siRecords, an extensive database of mammalian RNAi experiments with consistent efficacy ratings. This database serves two purposes. First, it provides a large and diverse dataset of siRNA experiments. This dataset faithfully represents the general, diverse RNAi experimental practice, and allows more reliable siRNA design tools to be developed with the overfitting problem well curbed. Second, the database helps experimental RNAi researchers directly by providing them with the efficacy and other information about the siRNAs experiments designed and conducted previously against the genes of their interest. The current release of siRecords contains the records of 17 192 RNAi experiments targeting 5086 genes.", "authors": ["Yongliang Ren", "Wuming Gong", "Haiyan Zhou", "Yejun Wang", "Feifei Xiao", "Tongbin Li"], "about": ["cost effectiveness", "gene silencing", "genes", "mammals", "biomedical research", "rna interference", "rna, small interfering", "datasets", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "siRecords: a database of mammalian RNAi experiments and efficacies\r\n "}
