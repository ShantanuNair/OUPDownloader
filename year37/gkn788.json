{"keywords": ["drosophila", "genes", "genome"], "abstract": "FlyBase (http://flybase.org) is a database of Drosophila genetic and genomic information. Gene Ontology (GO) terms are used to describe three attributes of wild-type gene products: their molecular function, the biological processes in which they play a role, and their subcellular location. This article describes recent changes to the FlyBase GO annotation strategy that are improving the quality of the GO annotation data. Many of these changes stem from our participation in the GO Reference Genome Annotation Project\u2014a multi-database collaboration producing comprehensive GO annotation sets for 12 diverse species.", "authors": ["Susan Tweedie", "Michael Ashburner", "Kathleen Falls", "Paul Leyland", "Peter McQuilton", "Steven Marygold", "Gillian Millburn", "David Osumi-Sutherland", "Andrew Schroeder", "Ruth Seal", "Haiyan Zhang", "The FlyBase Consortium"], "about": ["drosophila", "genes", "genome", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "FlyBase: enhancing Drosophila Gene Ontology annotations\r\n "}
