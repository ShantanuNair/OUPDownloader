Each entry includes the numerical values for the parameters IC50 (measure of the effectiveness of a compound in inhibiting biological function), Vmax (maximal velocity of transport), relative activity of mutants with respect to wild-type protein, binding affinity, dissociation constant, etc., which are important for understanding the sequence\u2013structure\u2013function relationship of membrane proteins. In addition, we have provided information about name and source of the protein, Uniprot and Protein Data Bank codes, mutational and literature information. Furthermore, TMFunction is linked to related databases and other resources. We have set up a web interface with different search and display options so that users have the ability to get the data in several ways. TMFunction is freely available at http://tmbeta-genome.cbrc.jp/TMFunction/.", "authors": ["M. Michael Gromiha", "Yukimitsu Yabuki", "M. Xavier Suresh", "A.
