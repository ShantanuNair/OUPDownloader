The content of OMIM is derived exclusively from the published biomedical literature and is updated daily. It currently contains 18 961 full-text entries describing phenotypes and genes. To date, 2239 genes have mutations causing disease, and 3770 diseases have a molecular basis. Approximately 70 new entries are added and 700 entries are updated per month. OMIM\u00ae is expanding content and organization in response to shifting biological paradigms and advancing biotechnology.", "authors": ["Joanna Amberger", "Carol A. Bocchini", "Alan F.
