We have developed a community portal, designated as Human Proteinpedia (http://www.humanproteinpedia.org/), for sharing both unpublished and published human proteomic data through the use of a distributed annotation system designed specifically for this purpose. This system allows laboratories to contribute and maintain protein annotations, which are also mapped to the corresponding proteins through the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD; http://www.hprd.org/). Thus, it is possible to visualize data pertaining to experimentally validated posttranslational modifications (PTMs), protein isoforms, protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs), tissue expression, expression in cell lines, subcellular localization and enzyme substrates in the context of individual proteins. With enthusiastic participation of the proteomics community, the past 15 months have witnessed data contributions from more than 75 labs around the world including 2710 distinct experiments, >1.9 million peptides, >4.8 million MS/MS spectra, 150 368 protein expression annotations, 17 410 PTMs, 34 624 PPIs and 2906 subcellular localization annotations. Human Proteinpedia should serve as an integrated platform to store, integrate and disseminate such proteomic data and is inching towards evolving into a unified human proteomics resource.", "authors": ["Kumaran Kandasamy", "Shivakumar Keerthikumar", "Renu Goel", "Suresh Mathivanan", "Nandini Patankar", "Beema Shafreen", "Santosh Renuse", "Harsh Pawar", "Y.
