{"keywords": ["genes", "toxicogenomics", "gene interaction", "knowledge bases"], "abstract": "The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a curated database that promotes understanding about the effects of environmental chemicals on human health. Biocurators at CTD manually curate chemical\u2013gene interactions, chemical\u2013disease relationships and gene\u2013disease relationships from the literature. This strategy allows data to be integrated to construct chemical\u2013gene\u2013disease networks. CTD is unique in numerous respects: curation focuses on environmental chemicals; interactions are manually curated; interactions are constructed using controlled vocabularies and hierarchies; additional gene attributes (such as Gene Ontology, taxonomy and KEGG pathways) are integrated; data can be viewed from the perspective of a chemical, gene or disease; results and batch queries can be downloaded and saved; and most importantly, CTD acts as both a knowledgebase (by reporting data) and a discovery tool (by generating novel inferences). Over 116 000 interactions between 3900 chemicals and 13 300 genes have been curated from 270 species, and 5900 gene\u2013disease and 2500 chemical\u2013disease direct relationships have been captured. By integrating these data, 350 000 gene\u2013disease relationships and 77 000 chemical\u2013disease relationships can be inferred. This wealth of chemical\u2013gene\u2013disease information yields testable hypotheses for understanding the effects of environmental chemicals on human health.
