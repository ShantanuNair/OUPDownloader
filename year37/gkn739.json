The VirusMINT database (http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/virusmint/) aims at collecting all protein interactions between viral and human proteins reported in the literature. VirusMINT currently stores over 5000 interactions involving more than 490 unique viral proteins from more than 110 different viral strains. The whole data set can be easily queried through the search pages and the results can be displayed with a graphical viewer. The curation effort has focused on manuscripts reporting interactions between human proteins and proteins encoded by some of the most medically relevant viruses: papilloma viruses, human immunodeficiency virus 1, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes viruses and Simian virus 40.", "authors": ["Andrew Chatr-aryamontri", "Arnaud Ceol", "Daniele Peluso", "Aurelio Nardozza", "Simona Panni", "Francesca Sacco", "Michele Tinti", "Alex Smolyar", "Luisa Castagnoli", "Marc Vidal", "Michael E.
