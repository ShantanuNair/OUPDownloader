{"keywords": ["genome", "genome, bacterial", "operon", "genome-wide association study"], "abstract": "The fast pace of bacterial genome sequencing and the resulting dependence on highly automated annotation methods has driven the development of many genome-wide analysis tools. OperonDB, first released in 2001, is a database containing the results of a computational algorithm for locating operon structures in microbial genomes. OperonDB has grown from 34 genomes in its initial release to more than 500 genomes today. In addition to increasing the size of the database, we have re-designed our operon finding algorithm and improved its accuracy. The new database is updated regularly as additional genomes become available in public archives. OperonDB can be accessed at: http://operondb.cbcb.umd.edu", "authors": ["Mihaela Pertea", "Kunmi Ayanbule", "Megan Smedinghoff", "Steven L.
