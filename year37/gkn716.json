{"keywords": ["mutation", "amino acid sequence", "mutagenesis"], "abstract": "The specificity-determining residue database (SDR database) presents residue positions where mutations are predicted to have changed protein function in large protein families. Because the database pre-calculates predictions on existing protein sequence alignments, users can quickly find the predictions by selecting the appropriate protein family or searching by protein sequence. Predictions can be used to guide mutagenesis or to gain a better understanding of specificity changes in a protein family. The database is available on the web at http://paradox.harvard.edu/sdr.", "authors": ["Jason E. Donald", "Eugene I.
