It integrates a large compilation of gene regulatory data including transcription factor binding sites, promoter structures and gene expression patterns. The whole dataset is manually curated and relies on published results extracted from the scientific literature. The current extended version of PRODORIC contains gene regulatory data for several new microorganisms. Major improvements were realized in the design of the web interface and the accessibility of the stored information. The database was further improved by the implementation of various new tools for the elucidation of gene regulatory interactions. Thus, the PRODORIC platform represents a framework for the interactive exploration, prediction and evaluation of gene regulatory networks in prokaryotes. PRODORIC is accessible at http://www.prodoric.de.", "authors": ["Andreas Grote", "Johannes Klein", "Ida Retter", "Isam Haddad", "Susanne Behling", "Boyke Bunk", "Ilona Biegler", "Svitlana Yarmolinetz", "Dieter Jahn", "Richard M\u00fcnch"], "about": ["gene expression", "binding sites", "gene expression regulation", "genes", "prokaryotic cells", "transcription factor", "microorganisms", "datasets", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "PRODORIC (release 2009): a database and tool platform for the analysis of gene regulation in prokaryotes\r\n "}
