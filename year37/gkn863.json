Its current release includes 2975 human proteins, 2907 reactions and 4455 literature citations. A new entity-level pathway viewer and improved search and data mining tools facilitate searching and visualizing pathway data and the analysis of user-supplied high-throughput data sets. Reactome has increased its utility to the model organism communities with improved orthology prediction methods allowing pathway inference for 22 species and through collaborations to create manually curated Reactome pathway datasets for species including Arabidopsis, Oryza sativa (rice), Drosophila and Gallus gallus (chicken). Reactome's data content and software can all be freely used and redistributed under open source terms.", "authors": ["Lisa Matthews", "Gopal Gopinath", "Marc Gillespie", "Michael Caudy", "David Croft", "Bernard de Bono", "Phani Garapati", "Jill Hemish", "Henning Hermjakob", "Bijay Jassal", "Alex Kanapin", "Suzanna Lewis", "Shahana Mahajan", "Bruce May", "Esther Schmidt", "Imre Vastrik", "Guanming Wu", "Ewan Birney", "Lincoln Stein", "Peter D\u2019Eustachio"], "about": ["arabidopsis", "chickens", "drosophila", "peer review", "rice", "software", "collaboration", "community", "inference", "data mining", "knowledge bases", "datasets", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Reactome knowledgebase of human biological pathways and processes\r\n "}
