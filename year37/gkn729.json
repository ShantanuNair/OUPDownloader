It can identify submitted nucleotide sequences, can place them into multiple whole-genome alignments (in species where more than one isolate has been fully sequenced) and contains translated genome sequences for all species. It has been created for two main purposes: to facilitate the comparative analysis of RNA viruses and to become a hub for other, more specialised virus Web sites. It is available at the following four mirrored sites. http://virus.zoo.ox.ac.uk/rnavirusdbhttp://hivweb.sanbi.ac.za/rnavirusdbhttp://bioinf.cs.auckland.ac.nz/rnavirusdbhttp://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/rnavirusdb", "authors": ["Robert Belshaw", "Tulio de Oliveira", "Sidney Markowitz", "Andrew Rambaut"], "about": ["base sequence", "genome", "internet", "rna viruses", "trees (plant)", "viruses", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The RNA Virus Database\r\n "}
