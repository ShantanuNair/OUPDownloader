{"keywords": ["gene expression", "blastoderm", "embryo", "genes", "datasets"], "abstract": "The datasets on gene expression are the valuable source of information about the functional state of an organism. Recently, we have acquired the large dataset on expression of segmentation genes in the Drosophila blastoderm. To provide efficient access to the data, we have developed the FlyEx database (http://urchin.spbcas.ru/flyex). FlyEx contains 4716 images of 14 segmentation gene expression patterns obtained from 1579 embryos and 9 500 000 quantitative data records. Reference data are available for all segmentation genes in cycles 11\u201313 and all temporal classes of cycle 14A. FlyEx supports operations on images of gene expression patterns. The database can be used to examine the quality of data, analyze the dynamics of formation of segmentation gene expression domains, as well as to estimate the variability of gene expression patterns. Currently, a user is able to monitor and analyze the dynamics of formation of segmentation gene expression domains over the whole period of segment determination, that amounts to 1.5 h of development. FlyEx supports the data downloads and construction of personal reference datasets, that makes it possible to more effectively use and analyze data.", "authors": ["Andrei Pisarev", "Ekaterina Poustelnikova", "Maria Samsonova", "John Reinitz"], "about": ["gene expression", "blastoderm", "embryo", "genes", "datasets", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "FlyEx, the quantitative atlas on segmentation gene expression at cellular resolution\r\n "}
