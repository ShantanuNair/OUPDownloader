We report a database of circadian genes in eukaryotes (CGDB, http://cgdb.biocuckoo.org), containing ∼73 000 circadian-related genes in 68 animals, 39 plants and 41 fungi. Circadian rhythm is ∼24 h rhythm in behavioral and physiological processes that exists in almost all organisms on the earth. Defects in the circadian system are highly associated with a number of diseases such as cancers. Although several databases have been established for rhythmically expressed genes, a comprehensive database of cycling genes across phyla is still lacking. From the literature, we collected 1382 genes of which transcript level oscillations were validated using methods such as RT-PCR, northern blot and in situ hybridization. Given that many genes exhibit different oscillatory patterns in different tissues/cells within an organism, we have included information regarding the phase and amplitude of the oscillation, as well as the tissue/cells in which the oscillation was identified. Using these well characterized cycling genes, we have then conducted an orthologous search and identified ∼45 000 potential cycling genes from 148 eukaryotes. Given that significant effort has been devoted to identifying cycling genes by transcriptome profiling, we have also incorporated these results, a total of over 26 000 genes, into our database.
