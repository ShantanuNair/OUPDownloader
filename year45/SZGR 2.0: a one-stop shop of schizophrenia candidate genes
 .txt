SZGR 2.0 is a comprehensive resource of candidate variants and genes for schizophrenia, covering genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, translational and many other types of evidence. By systematic review and curation of multiple lines of evidence, we included almost all variants and genes that have ever been reported to be associated with schizophrenia. In particular, we collected ∼4200 common variants reported in genome-wide association studies, ∼1000 de novo mutations discovered by large-scale sequencing of family samples, 215 genes spanning rare and replication copy number variations, 99 genes overlapping with linkage regions, 240 differentially expressed genes, 4651 differentially methylated genes and 49 genes as antipsychotic drug targets. To facilitate interpretation, we included various functional annotation data, especially brain eQTL, methylation QTL, brain expression featured in deep categorization of brain areas and developmental stages and brain-specific promoter and enhancer annotations. Furthermore, we conducted cross-study, cross-data type and integrative analyses of the multidimensional data deposited in SZGR 2.0, and made the data and results available through a user-friendly interface. In summary, SZGR 2.0 provides a one-stop shop of schizophrenia variants and genes and their function and regulation, providing an important resource in the schizophrenia and other mental disease community.
