SGN hosts several genome maps and sequences, including a pre-release of the tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum cv Heinz 1706) reference genome. A new transcriptome component has been added to store RNA-seq and microarray data. SGN is also an open source software project, continuously developing and improving a complex system for storing, integrating and analyzing data. All code and development work is publicly visible on GitHub ( http://github.com ). The database architecture combines SGN-specific schemas and the community-developed Chado schema ( http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado ) for compatibility with other genome databases. The SGN curation model is community-driven, allowing researchers to add and edit information using simple web tools. Currently, over a hundred community annotators help curate the database. SGN can be accessed at http://solgenomics.net/ . ", "authors": ["Aureliano Bombarely", "Naama Menda", "Isaak Y. Tecle", "Robert M.
