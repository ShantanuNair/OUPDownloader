To provide a systematic and comprehensive view of genes participating in plant hormonal regulation, an online accessible database Arabidopsis Hormone Database (AHD) has been developed, which is a collection of hormone related genes of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana (AHRGs). Recently we updated our database from AHD to a new version AHD2.0 by adding several pronounced features: (i) updating our collection of AHRGs based on most recent publications as well as constructing elaborate schematic diagrams of each hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways; (ii) adding orthologs of sequenced plants listed in OrthoMCL-DB to each AHRG in the updated database; (iii) providing predicted miRNA splicing site(s) for each AHRG; (iv) integrating genes that genetically interact with each AHRG according to literatures mining; (v) providing links to a powerful online analysis platform WebLab for the convenience of in-time bioinformatics analysis and (vi) providing links to widely used protein databases and integrating more expression profiling information that would facilitate users for a more systematic and integrative analysis related to phytohormone research.
