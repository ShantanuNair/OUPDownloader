{"keywords": ["gene expression", "arabidopsis", "dna", "genes", "genome", "ohio", "plants", "transcription factor", "verification"], "abstract": " The Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server (AGRIS; http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/ ) provides a comprehensive resource for gene regulatory studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . Three interlinked databases, AtTFDB, AtcisDB and AtRegNet, furnish comprehensive and updated information on transcription factors (TFs), predicted and experimentally verified cis -regulatory elements (CREs) and their interactions, respectively. In addition to significant contributions in the identification of the entire set of TF\u2013DNA interactions, which are the key to understand the gene regulatory networks that govern Arabidopsis gene expression, tools recently incorporated into AGRIS include the complete set of words length 5\u201315 present in the Arabidopsis genome and the integration of AtRegNet with visualization tools, such as the recently developed ReIN application. All the information in AGRIS is publicly available and downloadable upon registration.
