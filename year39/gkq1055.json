In its home page, an overview of the rationale for the database is seen and readers can access a tutorial to facilitate navigation in the website, which in turn is presented with tabs subdivided into LMs, receptors, extracellular binding and other related proteins. Each tab opens into a given LM or LM-related molecule, where the reader finds a series of further tabs for \u2018protein\u2019, \u2018gene structure\u2019, \u2018gene expression\u2019 and \u2018tissue distribution\u2019 and \u2018therapy\u2019. Data are separated as a function of species, comprising Homo sapiens , Mus musculus and Rattus novergicus . Furthermore, there is specific tab displaying the LM nomenclatures. In another tab, a direct link to PubMed, which can be then consulted in a specific way, in terms of the biological functions of each molecule, knockout animals and genetic diseases, immune response and lymphomas/leukemias. LM-database will hopefully be a relevant tool for retrieving information concerning LMs in health and disease, particularly regarding the hemopoietic system. ", "authors": ["Daiane C. F.
