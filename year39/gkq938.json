{"keywords": ["arabidopsis", "genes", "mining", "binding (molecular function)", "datasets"], "abstract": " The predicted Arabidopsis interactome resource (PAIR, http://www.cls.zju.edu.cn/pair/ ), comprised of 5990 experimentally reported molecular interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana together with 145\u2009494 predicted interactions, is currently the most comprehensive data set of the Arabidopsis interactome with high reliability. PAIR predicts interactions by a fine-tuned support vector machine model that integrates indirect evidences for interaction, such as gene co-expressions, domain interactions, shared GO annotations, co-localizations, phylogenetic profile similarities and homologous interactions in other organisms (interologs). These predictions were expected to cover 24% of the entire Arabidopsis interactome, and their reliability was estimated to be 44%. Two independent example data sets were used to rigorously validate the prediction accuracy. PAIR features a user-friendly query interface, providing rich annotation on the relationships between two proteins. A graphical interaction network browser has also been integrated into the PAIR web interface to facilitate mining of specific pathways.
