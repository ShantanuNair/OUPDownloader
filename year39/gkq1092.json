DroID contains genetic interactions and experimentally detected protein\u2013protein interactions curated from the literature and from external databases, and predicted protein interactions based on experiments in other species. Protein interactions are annotated with experimental details and periodically updated confidence scores. Data in DroID is accessible through user-friendly, intuitive interfaces that allow simple or advanced searches and graphical visualization of interaction networks. DroID has been expanded to include interaction types that enable more complete analyses of the genetic networks that underlie biological processes. In addition to protein\u2013protein and genetic interactions, the database now includes transcription factor\u2013gene and regulatory RNA\u2013gene interactions. In addition, DroID now has more gene expression data that can be used to search and filter interaction networks. Orthologous gene mappings of Drosophila genes to other organisms are also available to facilitate finding interactions based on gene names and identifiers for a number of common model organisms and humans. Improvements have been made to the web and graphical interfaces to help biologists gain a comprehensive view of the interaction networks relevant to the genes and systems that they study.
