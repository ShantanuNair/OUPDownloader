{"keywords": ["dictyostelium", "expressed sequence tags", "genes", "genome", "community"], "abstract": " dictyBase ( http://www.dictybase.org ), the model organism database for Dictyostelium , aims to provide the broad biomedical research community with well integrated, high quality data and tools for Dictyostelium discoideum and related species. dictyBase houses the complete genome sequence, ESTs, and the entire body of literature relevant to Dictyostelium . This information is curated to provide accurate gene models and functional annotations, with the goal of fully annotating the genome to provide a \u2018reference genome\u2019 in the Amoebozoa clade. We highlight several new features in the present update: (i) new annotations; (ii) improved interface with web 2.0 functionality; (iii) the initial steps towards a genome portal for the Amoebozoa; (iv) ortholog display; and (v) the complete integration of the Dicty Stock Center with dictyBase.
