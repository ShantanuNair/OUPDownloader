{"keywords": ["phenotype", "genes", "genome", "symbols"], "abstract": " The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) aims to assign a unique gene symbol and name to every human gene. The HGNC database currently contains almost 30\u2009000 approved gene symbols, over 19\u2009000 of which represent protein-coding genes. The public website, www.genenames.org , displays all approved nomenclature within Symbol Reports that contain data curated by HGNC editors and links to related genomic, phenotypic and proteomic information. Here we describe improvements to our resources, including a new Quick Gene Search, a new List Search, an integrated HGNC BioMart and a new Statistics and Downloads facility. ", "authors": ["Ruth L.
