It integrates 5807 structurally known interactions imported from the iPfam and 3did databases and 46\u2009900 domain interactions predicted by four computational methods: domain phylogenetic profiling, domain pair exclusion algorithm correlated mutations and domain interaction prediction in a discriminative way. Additionally predictions are filtered to exclude those domain pairs that are reported as non-interacting by the Negatome database. The DIMA Web site allows to calculate domain interaction networks either for a domain of interest or for entire organisms, and to explore them interactively using the Flash-based Cytoscape Web software.", "authors": ["Qibin Luo", "Philipp Pagel", "Baiba Vilne", "Dmitrij Frishman"], "about": ["drug interactions", "mutation", "genome", "microtubule-associated proteins", "tertiary protein structure", "software", "medroxyprogesterone acetate", "myh-associated polyposis", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "DIMA 3.0: Domain Interaction Map\r\n "}
