{"keywords": ["diagnostic radiologic examination", "roentgen rays", "genome", "peptides", "protein structure", "binding (molecular function)"], "abstract": " ModBase ( http://salilab.org/modbase ) is a database of annotated comparative protein structure models. The models are calculated by ModPipe, an automated modeling pipeline that relies primarily on Modeller for fold assignment, sequence\u2013structure alignment, model building and model assessment ( http://salilab.org/modeller/ ). ModBase currently contains 10\u2009355\u2009444 reliable models for domains in 2\u2009421\u2009920 unique protein sequences. ModBase allows users to update comparative models on demand, and request modeling of additional sequences through an interface to the ModWeb modeling server ( http://salilab.org/modweb ). ModBase models are available through the ModBase interface as well as the Protein Model Portal ( http://www.proteinmodelportal.org/ ). Recently developed associated resources include the SALIGN server for multiple sequence and structure alignment ( http://salilab.org/salign ), the ModEval server for predicting the accuracy of protein structure models ( http://salilab.org/modeval ), the PCSS server for predicting which peptides bind to a given protein ( http://salilab.org/pcss ) and the FoXS server for calculating and fitting Small Angle X-ray Scattering profiles ( http://salilab.org/foxs ).
