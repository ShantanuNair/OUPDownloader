{"keywords": ["laboratory", "peptides", "binding (molecular function)"], "abstract": " The database of three-dimensional interacting domains (3did) is a collection of protein interactions for which high-resolution three-dimensional structures are known. 3did exploits the availability of structural data to provide molecular details on interactions between two globular domains as well as novel domain\u2013peptide interactions, derived using a recently published method from our lab. The interface residues are presented for each interaction type individually, plus global domain interfaces at which one or more partners (domains or peptides) bind. The 3did web server at http://3did.irbbarcelona.org visualizes these interfaces along with atomic details of individual interactions using Jmol. The complete contents are also available for download.
