{"keywords": ["databases", "stretching exercises"], "abstract": " We describe the Biomolecule Stretching Data Base that has been recently set up at http://www.ifpan.edu.pl/BSDB/ . It provides information about mechanostability of proteins. Its core is based on simulations of stretching of 17\u2009134 proteins within a structure-based model. The primary information is about the heights of the maximal force peaks, the force\u2013displacement patterns, and the sequencing of the contact-rupturing events. We also summarize the possible types of the mechanical clamps, i.e. the motifs which are responsible for a protein's resistance to stretching. ", "authors": ["Mateusz Sikora", "Joanna I.
