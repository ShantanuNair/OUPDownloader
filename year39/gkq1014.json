{"keywords": ["carbohydrates", "protein data bank"], "abstract": " GlycomeDB integrates the structural and taxonomic data of all major public carbohydrate databases, as well as carbohydrates contained in the Protein Data Bank, which renders the database currently the most comprehensive and unified resource for carbohydrate structures worldwide. GlycomeDB retains the links to the original databases and is updated at weekly intervals with the newest structures available from the source databases. The complete database can be downloaded freely or accessed through a Web-interface ( www.glycome-db.org ) that provides flexible and powerful search functionalities.
