Each entry for a protein (or protein complex) in UniPROBE provides the quantitative preferences for all possible nucleotide sequence variants (\u2018words\u2019) of length k (\u2018 k -mers\u2019), as well as position weight matrix (PWM) and graphical sequence logo representations of the k -mer data. In this update, we describe >130% expansion of the database content, incorporation of a protein BLAST (blastp) tool for finding protein sequence matches in UniPROBE, the introduction of UniPROBE accession numbers and additional database enhancements. The UniPROBE database is available at http://uniprobe.org . ", "authors": ["Kimberly Robasky", "Martha L.
