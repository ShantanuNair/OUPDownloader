{"keywords": ["protein structure", "affinity", "protein data bank"], "abstract": " The RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) web site ( http://www.pdb.org ) has been redesigned to increase usability and to cater to a larger and more diverse user base. This article describes key enhancements and new features that fall into the following categories: (i) query and analysis tools for chemical structure searching, query refinement, tabulation and export of query results; (ii) web site customization and new structure alerts; (iii) pair-wise and representative protein structure alignments; (iv) visualization of large assemblies; (v) integration of structural data with the open access literature and binding affinity data; and (vi) web services and web widgets to facilitate integration of PDB data and tools with other resources. These improvements enable a range of new possibilities to analyze and understand structure data. The next generation of the RCSB PDB web site, as described here, provides a rich resource for research and education. ", "authors": ["Peter W. Rose", "Bojan Beran", "Chunxiao Bi", "Wolfgang F.
