{"keywords": ["healthcare quality assessment", "datasets"], "abstract": " Despite the availability of a large number of protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) in several species, researchers are often limited to using very small subsets in a few organisms due to the high prevalence of spurious interactions. In spite of the importance of quality assessment of experimentally determined PPIs, a surprisingly small number of databases provide interactions with scores and confidence levels. We introduce HitPredict ( http://hintdb.hgc.jp/htp/ ), a database with quality assessed PPIs in nine species. HitPredict assigns a confidence level to interactions based on a reliability score that is computed using evidence from sequence, structure and functional annotations of the interacting proteins. HitPredict was first released in 2005 and is updated annually. The current release contains 36\u2009930 proteins with 176\u2009983 non-redundant, physical interactions, of which 116\u2009198 (66%) are predicted to be of high confidence.
