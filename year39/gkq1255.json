In order to gain insights into the above phenomena, it is necessary to investigate different types of helix-packing modes and interactions. However, such information is difficult to obtain because of the experimental impediment and a lack of a well-annotated source of helix-packing folds in TM proteins. We have developed the TMPad ( T rans M embrane Protein Helix- Pa cking D atabase) which addresses the above issues by integrating experimentally observed helix\u2013helix interactions and related structural information of membrane proteins. Specifically, the TMPad offers pre-calculated geometric descriptors at the helix-packing interface including residue backbone/side-chain contacts, interhelical distances and crossing angles, helical translational shifts and rotational angles. The TMPad also includes the corresponding sequence, topology, lipid accessibility, ligand-binding information and supports structural classification, schematic diagrams and visualization of the above structural features of TM helix-packing. Through detailed annotations and visualizations of helix-packing, this online resource can serve as an information gateway for deciphering the relationship between helix\u2013helix interactions and higher levels of organization in TM protein structure and function. The website of the TMPad is freely accessible to the public at http://bio-cluster.iis.sinica.edu.tw/TMPad .
