{"keywords": ["entamoeba", "genes", "genome", "community", "microsporidia", "basic local alignment search tool"], "abstract": " AmoebaDB ( http://AmoebaDB.org ) and MicrosporidiaDB ( http://MicrosporidiaDB.org ) are new functional genomic databases serving the amoebozoa and microsporidia research communities, respectively. AmoebaDB contains the genomes of three Entamoeba species ( E. dispar , E. invadens and E. histolityca ) and microarray expression data for E. histolytica . MicrosporidiaDB contains the genomes of Encephalitozoon cuniculi, E. intestinalis and E. bieneusi . The databases belong to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) funded EuPathDB ( http://EuPathDB.org ) Bioinformatics Resource Center family of integrated databases and assume the same architectural and graphical design as other EuPathDB resources such as PlasmoDB and TriTrypDB. Importantly they utilize the graphical strategy builder that affords a database user the ability to ask complex multi-data-type questions with relative ease and versatility. Genomic scale data can be queried based on BLAST searches, annotation keywords and gene ID searches, GO terms, sequence motifs, protein characteristics, phylogenetic relationships and functional data such as transcript (microarray and EST evidence) and protein expression data. Search strategies can be saved within a user\u2019s profile for future retrieval and may also be shared with other researchers using a unique strategy web address.
