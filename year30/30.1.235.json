The PROSITE database (http://www.expasy.org/prosite/) consists of biologically significant patterns and profiles designed in such a way that with appropriate computational tools it can rapidly and reliably help to determine to which known family of proteins (if any) a new sequence belongs, or which known domain(s) it contains.", "authors": ["Laurent Falquet", "Marco Pagni", "Philipp Bucher", "Nicolas Hulo", "Christian J.
