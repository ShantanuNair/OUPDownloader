The aim of this undertaking is to identify and collate up to 150 000 SNPs from the Japanese population, located in genes or in adjacent regions that might influence the coding sequence of the genes. The project has been carried out by a collaboration between the Human Genome Center (HGC) in the Institute of Medical Science (IMS) at the University of Tokyo and the Japan Science and Technology Corporation (JST). JSNP serves as both a storage site for the Japanese SNPs obtained from the ongoing project and as a facility for public dissemination to allow researchers access to high quality SNP data. A primary motivation of the project is the construction of a basic data set to identify relationships between polymorphisms and common diseases or the reaction to drugs. As such, emphasis has been placed on the identification of SNPs that lie in candidate regions which may affect phenotype but which would not necessarily directly cause disease. Unrestricted access to JSNP and any associated files is available at http://snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.", "authors": ["Mika Hirakawa", "Toshihiro Tanaka", "Yoichi Hashimoto", "Masako Kuroda", "Toshihisa Takagi", "Yusuke Nakamura"], "about": ["phenotype", "polymorphism", "genes", "genome, human", "motivation", "open reading frames", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "tokyo", "japanese", "datasets", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "JSNP: a database of common gene variations in the Japanese population\r\n "}
