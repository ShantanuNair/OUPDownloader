MGD strives to provide a highly curated, highly integrated information resource that not only includes the consensus view of current knowledge about the mouse, but also provides comparative genomic information particularly for human and rat genomes. MGD includes extensive information about mouse genes, supporting all gene attribute assertions with experimental data, statements of evidence and citation. Detailed information about alleles and mouse mutants includes genotype, molecular variant and phenotype descriptions. Extensive collaboration with other data providers such as NCBI, RIKEN and SWISS-PROT provides standardization of gene:sequence associations and robust interconnections between large information systems based on shared sequence curation. Recent integration of large datasets of mouse full-length cDNAs and radiation-hybrid mapped ESTs, the continued development and use of extensive structured vocabularies and the expansion of the representation of phenotypes highlight this year\u2019s developments.", "authors": ["Judith A.
