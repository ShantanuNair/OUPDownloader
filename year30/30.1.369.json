Angiogenesis occurs in a variety of normal physiological and pathological conditions and is regulated by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory angiogenic factors. The control of this balance may fail and result in the formation of a pathologic capillary network during the development of many diseases. Therefore, we developed the angiogenesis database (AngioDB), which can provide a signaling network of angiogenesis-related biomolecules in human. Each record of AngioDB consisted of 12 fields and was developed by using a relational database management system. For the retrieval of data, Active Server Page (ASP) technology was integrated in this system. Users can access the database by a query or imagemap browsing program. The retrieving system also provides a list of angiogenesis-related molecules classified by three categories, and the database has an external link to NCBI databases. AngioDB is available via the Internet at http://angiodb.snu.ac.kr/.", "authors": ["Tae-Kwon Sohn", "Eun-Joung Moon", "Seok-Ki Lee", "Hwan-Gue Cho", "Kyu-Won Kim"], "about": ["angiogenesis", "angiogenesis factor", "database management systems", "signal transduction", "internet", "krypton", "blood capillaries", "molecule", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "AngioDB: database of angiogenesis and  angiogenesis-related molecules\r\n "}
