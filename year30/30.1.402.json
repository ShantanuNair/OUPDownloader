The current release (as of September 7, 2001) includes 7298 compounds, 5166 reactions and 3829 enzymes. In addition to the keyword search provided by the DBGET/LinkDB system, a substructure search to the COMPOUND and REACTION sections is now available through the World Wide Web (http://www.genome.ad.jp/ligand/).
