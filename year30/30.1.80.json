{"keywords": ["genes", "microscopy, video", "yeasts", "intracellular protein transport", "personal integrity"], "abstract": "The Yeast Protein Localization database (YPL.db) contains information about the localization patterns of yeast proteins resulting from microscopic analyses. The data and parameters of the experiments to obtain the localization information, together with images from confocal or video microscopy, are stored in a relational database, building an archive of, and the documentation for, all experiments. The database can be queried based on gene name, protein localization, growth conditions and a number of additional parameters. All experiment parameters are selectable from predefined lists to ensure database integrity and conformity across different investigators. The database provides a structure reference resource to allow for better characterization of unknown or ambiguous localization patterns. Links to MIPS, YPD and SGD databases are provided to allow fast access to further information not contained in the localization database itself. YPL.db is available at http://ypl.tugraz.at.", "authors": ["Georg Habeler", "Klaus Natter", "Gerhard G. Thallinger", "Matthew E. Crawford", "Sepp D.
