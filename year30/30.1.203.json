The VirOligo database consists of two tables, Common data and Oligo data. The Oligo data table contains PCR primers and hybridization probes used for detection of viral nucleic acids and the Common data table contains the experimental conditions used in their detection. Each oligonucleotide entry contains links to PubMed, GenBank, NCBI Taxonomy databases and BLAST. As of July 2001, the VirOligo database contains a complete listing of oligonucleotides specific to viral agents associated with bovine respiratory disease that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. The viruses are bovine herpes virus types 1, 3, 4 and 5, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine parainfluenza 3 virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine adenovirus, bovine rhinovirus, bovine coronavirus, bovine reovirus, bovine enterovirus and alcelaphine herpesvirus-1. The VirOligo database is being expanded to other viruses and can be accessed through the Internet at http://viroligo.okstate.edu/.", "authors": ["Kenji Onodera", "Ulrich Melcher"], "about": ["polymerase chain reaction", "herpesviridae", "coronavirus", "bovine adenovirus", "cattle", "diarrhea virus 1, bovine viral", "bovine viral diarrhea viruses", "dna probes", "enterovirus, bovine", "internet", "nucleic acids", "oligonucleotides", "orthoreoviruses", "bovine parainfluenza virus 3", "peer review", "reoviridae", "respiration disorders", "respiratory syncytial viruses", "respiratory tract diseases", "rhinovirus", "taxonomic classification", "viruses", "genbank", "basic local alignment search tool", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "VirOligo: a database of virus-specific oligonucleotides\r\n "}
