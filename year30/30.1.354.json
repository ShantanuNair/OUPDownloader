{"keywords": ["metadata", "genes", "languages", "smell perception", "xml", "genbank", "knowledge bases"], "abstract": "The Olfactory Receptor Database (ORDB; http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/ordb) is a central repository of olfactory receptor (OR) and olfactory receptor-like gene and protein sequences. To deal with the very large OR gene family, we have constructed an algorithm that automatically downloads sequences from web sources such as GenBank and SWISS-PROT into the database. The algorithm uses hypertext markup language (HTML) parsing techniques that extract information relevant to ORDB. The information is then correlated with the metadata in the ORDB knowledge base to encode the unstructured text extracted into the structured format compliant with the database architecture, entity attribute value with classes and relationship (EAV/CR), which supports the SenseLab project as a whole. Three population methods: batch, automatic and semi-automatic population are discussed. The data is imported into the database using extensible markup language (XML).", "authors": ["Chiquito Crasto", "Luis Marenco", "Perry Miller", "Gordon Shepherd"], "about": ["metadata", "genes", "languages", "smell perception", "xml", "genbank", "knowledge bases", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Olfactory Receptor Database: a metadata-driven automated population from sources of gene and protein sequences\r\n "}
