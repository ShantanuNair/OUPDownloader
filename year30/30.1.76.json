The database includes most of the available expression data published on yeast microarrays over the last 4 years. It provides customizable tools for the rapid visualization of expression profiles associated with a set of genes from all published experiments. It also allows users to compare the results from different publications so that they can identify genes with common expression profiles. We used yMGV to perform global analyses to find a gene expression profile specific for given biological conditions and to locate functional gene clusters on chromosomes. Other organisms will be added to this database. yMGV is accessible on the web at http://transcriptome.ens.fr/ymgv.", "authors": ["St\u00e9phane Le Crom", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Devaux", "Claude Jacq", "Philippe Marc"], "about": ["chromosomes", "gene expression profiling", "genes", "genome", "yeasts", "gene clusters", "data mining", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "yMGV: helping biologists with yeast microarray data mining\r\n "}
