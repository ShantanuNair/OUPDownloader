Users have access to the human and mouse genome sequences with annotation presented in summary form in BioMolecule Reports for genes, transcripts and proteins. Over 40 additional databases are available, including sequence, mapping, mutation, genetic variation, mRNA expression, protein structure, motif and classification data. Data are accessible by browsing reports, through a variety of interactive graphical viewers, and by advanced query capability provided by the LION SRS\u2122 search engine. A growing number of sequence analysis tools are available, including sequence similarity, pattern searching, multiple sequence alignment and Hidden Markov Model search. A user workspace keeps track of queries and analyses. CDS is widely used by the academic research community and requires a subscription for access. The system and academic pricing information are available at http://cds.celera.com.", "authors": ["Anthony Kerlavage", "Vivien Bonazzi", "Matteo di Tommaso", "Charles Lawrence", "Peter Li", "Frank Mayberry", "Richard Mural", "Marc Nodell", "Mark Yandell", "Jinghui Zhang", "Paul Thomas"], "about": ["mutation", "fees and charges", "genes", "genome", "lions", "mining", "rna, messenger", "sequence alignment", "sequence analysis", "genetics", "mice", "protein structure", "community", "search engine", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The Celera Discovery System\u2122\r\n "}
