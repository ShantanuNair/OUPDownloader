{"keywords": ["databases", "chromosomes", "genes", "genome", "community"], "abstract": "The current deluge of genomic sequences has spawned the creation of tools capable of making sense of the data. Computational and high-throughput experimental methods for generating links between proteins have recently been emerging. These methods effectively act as hypothesis machines, allowing researchers to screen large sets of data to detect interesting patterns that can then be studied in greater detail. Although the potential use of these putative links in predicting gene function has been demonstrated, a central repository for all such links for many genomes would maximize their usefulness. Here we present Predictome, a database of predicted links between the proteins of 44 genomes based on the implementation of three computational methods\u2014chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic profiling and domain fusion\u2014and large-scale experimental screenings of protein\u2013protein interaction data. The combination of data from various predictive methods in one database allows for their comparison with each other, as well as visualization of their correlation with known pathway information. As a repository for such data, Predictome is an ongoing resource for the community, providing functional relationships among proteins as new genomic data emerges. Predictome is available at http://predictome.bu.edu.", "authors": ["Joseph C. Mellor", "Itai Yanai", "Karl H.
