{"keywords": ["dictyostelium", "genome"], "abstract": "Dictyostelium is an attractive model system for the study of mechanisms basic to cellular function or complex multicellular developmental processes. Recent advances in Dictyostelium genomics have generated a wide spectrum of resources. However, much of the current genomic sequence information is still not currently available through GenBank or related databases. Thus, many investigators are unaware that extensive sequence data from Dictyostelium has been compiled, or of its availability and access. Here, we discuss progress in Dictyostelium genomics and gene annotation, and highlight the primary portals for sequence access, manipulation and analysis (http://genome.imb-jena.de/dictyostelium/; http://dictygenome.bcm.tmc.edu/; http://www.sanger. ac.uk/Projects/D_discoideum/; http://www.csm.biol. tsukuba.ac.jp/cDNAproject.html).", "authors": ["Lisa Kreppel", "Alan R.
