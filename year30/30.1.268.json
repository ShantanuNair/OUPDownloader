{"keywords": ["amino acids", "genes", "genome", "genomics", "libraries", "nucleotides", "tertiary protein structure"], "abstract": "The SUPERFAMILY database contains a library of hidden Markov models representing all proteins of known structure. The database is based on the SCOP \u2018superfamily\u2019 level of protein domain classification which groups together the most distantly related proteins which have a common evolutionary ancestor. There is a public server at http://supfam.org which provides three services: sequence searching, multiple alignments to sequences of known structure, and structural assignments to all complete genomes. Given an amino acid or nucleotide query sequence the server will return the domain architecture and SCOP classification. The server produces alignments of the query sequences with sequences of known structure, and includes multiple alignments of genome and PDB sequences. The structural assignments are carried out on all complete genomes (currently 59) covering approximately half of the soluble protein domains. The assignments, superfamily breakdown and statistics on them are available from the server. The database is currently used by this group and others for genome annotation, structural genomics, gene prediction and domain-based genomic studies.", "authors": ["Julian Gough", "Cyrus Chothia"], "about": ["amino acids", "genes", "genome", "genomics", "libraries", "nucleotides", "tertiary protein structure", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "SUPERFAMILY: HMMs representing all proteins of known structure.
