The main information provided by FUGOID includes intron sequence, subclass, resident ORF, self-splicing capability, host gene, protein factor(s) involved in splicing, mobility, insertion site, twintron, seminal references and taxonomic position of host organism. It is implemented in a relational database management system, allowing sophisticated, user-friendly searching, data entry and revision. Users can access the database by any common web browser using a variety of operating systems. The main page of the database is available at http://wnt.cc.utexas.edu/~ifmr530/introndata/main.htm.", "authors": ["Fei Li", "David L.
