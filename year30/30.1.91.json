{"keywords": ["arabidopsis", "genes", "genome", "genome, plant", "plants", "thalidomide", "genetics"], "abstract": "Arabidopsisthaliana is the first plant for which the complete genome has been sequenced and published. Annotation of complex eukaryotic genomes requires more than the assignment of genetic elements to the sequence. Besides completing the list of genes, we need to discover their cellular roles, their regulation and their interactions in order to understand the workings of the whole plant. The MIPS Arabidopsisthaliana Database (MAtDB; http://mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db) started out as a repository for genome sequence data in the European Scientists Sequencing Arabidopsis (ESSA) project and the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative. Our aim is to transform MAtDB into an integrated biological knowledge resource by integrating diverse data, tools, query and visualization capabilities and by creating a comprehensive resource for Arabidopsis as a reference model for other species, including crop plants.", "authors": ["Heiko Schoof", "Paolo Zaccaria", "Heidrun Gundlach", "Kai Lemcke", "Stephen Rudd", "Grigory Kolesov", "Roland Arnold", "H.
