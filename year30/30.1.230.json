The chicken B cell line DT40 allows efficient gene disruptions due to its high homologous recombination activity. However, cloning the gene of interest is often cumbersome, since relatively few chicken cDNA sequences are present in the public databases. In addition, the accumulation of multiple mutations within the same cell clone is limited by the consumption of one drug-resistance marker for each transfection. Here, we present the DT40 web site (http://genetics.hpi.uni-hamburg.de/dt40.html), which includes a comprehensive database of chicken bursal ESTs to identify disruption candidate genes and recyclable marker cassettes based on the loxP system. These freely available resources greatly facilitate the analysis of genes and genetic networks.", "authors": ["Jean-Marie Buerstedde", "Hiroshi Arakawa", "Akira Watahiki", "Piere Piero Carninci", "Y.\u00a0Yoshihide Hayashizaki", "Bernhard Korn", "Jiri Plachy"], "about": ["mutation", "b-lymphocytes", "drug resistance", "cloning", "chickens", "clone cells", "dna, complementary", "expressed sequence tags", "genes", "recombination, genetic", "transfection", "vertebrates", "genetics", "candidate disease gene", "history of present illness", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The DT40 web site: sampling and connecting the genes of a B cell line\r\n "}
