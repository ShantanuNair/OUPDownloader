It provides access to all structure entries deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Nucleic Acid Database (NDB). In addition, basic information on the architecture of biological macromolecules is offered. Recent developments include a site database and an analysis tool that identifies all residues surrounding hetero components or sites according to geometrical criteria. This enables one to search for all structures with a certain pattern of amino acids/nucleotides/water adjacent to hetero components or sites. A new PDB/SWISS-PROT cross-reference database combines information from both PDB and SWISS-PROT, thus providing significantly more cross-references than either PDB or SWISS-PROT. The existing brief descriptions of X-ray, NMR and FTIR methods for structure determination are supplemented by information on circular dichroism.", "authors": ["Jan Reichert", "J\u00fcrgen S\u00fchnel"], "about": ["diagnostic radiologic examination", "roentgen rays", "amino acids", "biopolymers", "circular dichroism", "nucleic acid databases", "libraries", "nucleotides", "spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared", "macromolecule", "protein data bank", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The IMB Jena Image Library of Biological Macromolecules: 2002 update\r\n "}
