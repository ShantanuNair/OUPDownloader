{"keywords": ["databases", "catalysis", "protein splicing", "basic local alignment search tool"], "abstract": "Inteins are self-catalytic protein splicing elements. InBase (http://www.neb.com/neb/inteins.html), the Intein Database and Registry, is a curated compilation of published and unpublished information about protein splicing. It presents general information as well as detailed data for each intein, including tabulated comparisons and a comprehensive bibliography. An intein-specific BLAST server is now available to assist in identifying new inteins.", "authors": ["Francine B.
