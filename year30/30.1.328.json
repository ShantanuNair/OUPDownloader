To overcome this difficulty, we have developed the oligo-capping method to obtain full-length cDNAs, the information of which has been partly deposited in public databases. In this study, we further constructed human cDNA libraries enriched in clones containing the cap structure to systematically explore the 5\u2032 end structure of expressed genes. Of approximately 217\u00a0402 5\u2032 end sequences obtained, 111\u00a0382 have been matched to cDNA sequences of known genes (7889 genes) and are presented in our new database, DataBase of Transcriptional Start Sites (DBTSS; http://elmo.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/dbtss/). Sequence comparison between our entries and those of a reference sequence database, RefSeq, revealed that 4683 (34%) of RefSeq sequences should be extended towards the 5\u2032 ends. We also mapped each sequence on the human draft genome sequence to identify its transcriptional start site, which provides us with more detailed information on distribution patterns of transcriptional start sites and adjacent regulatory regions.", "authors": ["Yutaka Suzuki", "Riu Yamashita", "Kenta Nakai", "Sumio Sugano"], "about": ["transcription, genetic", "databases", "clone cells", "dna, complementary", "genes", "genome", "libraries", "oligonucleotides", "regulatory sequences, nucleic acid", "tokyo", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "DBTSS: DataBase of human Transcriptional Start Sites and full-length cDNAs\r\n "}
