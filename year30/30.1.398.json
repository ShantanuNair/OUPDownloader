{"keywords": ["genes", "organizations", "neural stem cells"], "abstract": "The GeneNet database is designed for accumulation of information on gene networks. Original technology applied in GeneNet enables description of not only a gene network structure and functional relationships between components, but also metabolic and signal transduction pathways. Specialised software, GeneNet Viewer, automatically displays the graphical diagram of gene networks described in the database. Current release 3.0 of GeneNet database contains descriptions of 25 gene networks, 945 proteins, 567 genes, 151 other substances and 1364 relationships between components of gene networks. Information distributed between 14 interlinked tables was obtained by annotating 968 scientific publications. The SRS-version of GeneNet database is freely available (http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/systems/genenet/).", "authors": ["E. A. Ananko", "N. L. Podkolodny", "I. L. Stepanenko", "E. V.
