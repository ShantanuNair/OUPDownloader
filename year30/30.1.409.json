CKAAPs may be important in protein folding and structural stability and function, and hence useful for protein engineering studies. This paper provides an update to the initial report of CKAAPs DB [Li et al. (2001) Nucleic Acids Res., 29, 329\u2013331]. CKAAPs DB contains CKAAPs for the representative set of polypeptide chains derived from the CE and FSSP databases, as well as subdomains (conserved regions of the order of 100 residues within a domain) identified by CE. The new version now offers different perspectives on the CKAAPs. First, CKAAPs are mapped onto their respective Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures rendered by Molscript, providing a spatial context for the CKAAPs. Secondly, CKAAPs may be highlighted within a structure-based sequence alignment, as well as secondary structure alignment. Thirdly, the resulting sequence homologs from the structure alignment may be viewed in alignments colorized based on identities and property groups using Mview. New search capabilities have also been provided for searching by keyword combinations, PDB IDs, EC numbers, GI numbers, LocusLink ID, taxonomy, gene ontology and pathways. A new custom CKAAPs analysis interface has been implemented where a user may change the criteria for inclusion of chains, initiate CKAAPs analysis and retrieve results. CKAAPs DB is accessible through the web at http://ckaaps.sdsc.edu/. Plain text analysis results are available by FTP at ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/sdsc/biology/ckaap.", "authors": ["Wilfred W.
