The data are mainly extracted from original publications, but a World Wide Web interface for direct submissions is also available. S/MARt DB is closely linked to the TRANSFAC database on transcription factors and their binding sites. It is freely accessible through the World Wide Web (http://transfac.gbf.de/SMARtDB/) for non-profit research.", "authors": ["Ines Liebich", "J\u00fcrgen Bode", "Matthias Frisch", "Edgar Wingender"], "about": ["databases", "binding sites", "chromosomes", "internet", "mars", "nuclear matrix", "transcription factor", "motor agitation and retardation scale", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "S/MARt DB: a database on scaffold/matrix attached regions\r\n "}
