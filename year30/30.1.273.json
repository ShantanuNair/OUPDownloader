{"keywords": ["internet", "libraries", "ligands", "tertiary protein structure", "memory", "basic local alignment search tool", "knowledge bases"], "abstract": "SBASE (http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/sbase) is an online resource of protein domain sequences designed to facilitate detection of domain homologies based on a simple database search. The ninth release of the SBASE library of protein domain sequences contains 320\u00a0000 annotated structural, functional, ligand-binding and topogenic segments of proteins clustered into over 3481 domain groups and 483 protein families. Domain identification and functional prediction are based on a comparison of BLAST search outputs with a knowledge base of within-group (\u2018self\u2019) and out-of-group (\u2018non-self\u2019) similarities of the known domain groups. This is a memory-based approach wherein class-specific similarity functions are automatically learned from the database [Stanfill,C. and Waltz,D. (1986) Commun.
