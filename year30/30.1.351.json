It is now clear that a subset of genes containing the homeobox motif play key roles in the orchestration of genes which control embryonic patterning, morphogenesis, cell differentiation and malignant transformation. The HOX Pro contains a broad spectrum of information including images, diagrams and animations. Currently this amounts to approximately 700 HTML pages together with 400 images which contain information on 200 groups of genes and 90 promoters, in turn linked to maps of 13 HOX clusters and nine genetic networks. There are about 700 sequences of individual hox-genes of animals classified in approximately 200 homologous or paralogous groups. Graphical representation of HOX clusters and Hox-based networks is accomplished by means of flow and 3D diagrams, JavaScript animations and Java applets. The HOX Pro now includes sections presenting data mining and data simulation issues. The DB is located at http://www.iephb.nw.ru/hoxpro.", "authors": ["Alexander V.
