The Gene Resource Locator (GRL) assembles gene maps that include information on gene-expression patterns, cis-elements in regulatory regions and alternatively spliced transcripts. The database was constructed using customized software, and currently contains 2.2 million alignments (exon\u2013intron structures). The alignments have been annotated and integrated into a system that encompasses approximately 90 000 EST loci sharing common exons, 8091 alternatively spliced transcript groups, 10 801 expression-profile groups, 8066 candidate regulatory regions in full-length cDNAs, and 1 million SNP loci. We have used Flash technology to build a dynamic web viewer that facilitates browsing through the millions of alignments. All of the information is available through the World Wide Web at the Gene Resource Locator web site (http://grl.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp).", "authors": ["Toshihiko Honkura", "Jun Ogasawara", "Tomoyuki Yamada", "Shinichi Morishita"], "about": ["gene expression", "exons", "gene expression profiling", "genes", "genome", "genome, human", "introns", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "regulatory sequences, nucleic acid", "tokyo", "maps", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The Gene Resource Locator: gene locus maps for transcriptome analysis\r\n "}
