{"keywords": ["genes", "plants", "protease inhibitor", "molecule"], "abstract": "PLANT-PIs is a database developed to facilitate retrieval of information on plant protease inhibitors (PIs) and related genes. For each PI, links to sequence databases are reported together with a summary of the functional properties of the molecule (and its mutants) as deduced from literature. PLANT-PIs contains information for 351 plant PIs, plus several isoinhibitors. The database is accessible at http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/PLANT-PIs.", "authors": ["F. De Leo", "M. Volpicella", "F.
