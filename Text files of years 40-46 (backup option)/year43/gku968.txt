TITLE: P2CS: updates of the prokaryotic two-component systems database
 
The P2CS database (http://www.p2cs.org/) is a comprehensive resource for the analysis of Prokaryotic Two-Component Systems (TCSs). TCSs are comprised of a receptor histidine kinase (HK) and a partner response regulator (RR) and control important prokaryotic behaviors. The latest incarnation of P2CS includes 164 651 TCS proteins, from 2758 sequenced prokaryotic genomes.
