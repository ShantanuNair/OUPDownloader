TITLE: PNRD: a plant non-coding RNA database
 
The first ncRNA found was an alanine tRNA in baker's yeast, and the first detected microRNAs (miRNAs) promoted ncRNA research to a whole new level. Research on ncRNAs in animals has focused on the medical field, while in plant scientists are more concerned with improving agronomic traits. In 2010, we constructed a plant miRNA database named PMRD to meet the demand for miRNA research in plants. To provide a way to do fundamental research on plant ncRNAs and take full advantage of tremendous public resources, we designed an updated platform called plant ncRNA database (PNRD) based on its predecessor PMRD, which is accessible at http://structuralbiology.cau.edu.cn/PNRD. We collected a total of 25739 entries of 11 different types of ncRNAs from 150 plant species. Targets of miRNAs were extended to 178138 pairs in 46 species, while the number of miRNA expression profiles reached 35. Improvements in PNRD are not only the larger amounts of data, but also better service, such as a more user-friendly interface, more multifunctional and browsing options and more background data for users to download. We also integrated currently prevalent technologies and toolkits to strengthen the capability of the database and provide a one-stop service for scientific users.
