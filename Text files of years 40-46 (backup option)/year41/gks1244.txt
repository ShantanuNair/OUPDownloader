TITLE: The disease and gene annotations (DGA): an annotation resource for human disease
 
Disease and Gene Annotations database (DGA, http://dga.nubic.northwestern.edu) is a collaborative effort aiming to provide a comprehensive and integrative annotation of the human genes in disease network context by integrating computable controlled vocabulary of the Disease Ontology (DO version 3 revision 2510, which has 8043 inherited, developmental and acquired human diseases), NCBI Gene Reference Into Function (GeneRIF) and molecular interaction network (MIN). DGA integrates these resources together using semantic mappings to build an integrative set of disease-to-gene and gene-to-gene relationships with excellent coverage based on current knowledge. DGA is kept current by periodically reparsing DO, GeneRIF, and MINs. DGA provides a user-friendly and interactive web interface system enabling users to efficiently query, download and visualize the DO tree structure and annotations as a tree, a network graph or a tabular list. To facilitate integrative analysis, DGA provides a web service Application Programming Interface for integration with external analytic tools.
