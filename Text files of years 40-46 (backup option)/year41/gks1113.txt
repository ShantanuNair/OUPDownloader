TITLE: EuPathDB: The Eukaryotic Pathogen database
 
EuPathDB (http://eupathdb.org) resources include 11 databases supporting eukaryotic pathogen genomic and functional genomic data, isolate data and phylogenomics. EuPathDB resources are built using the same infrastructure and provide a sophisticated search strategy system enabling complex interrogations of underlying data. Recent advances in EuPathDB resources include the design and implementation of a new data loading workflow, a new database supporting Piroplasmida (i.e. Babesia and Theileria), the addition of large amounts of new data and data types and the incorporation of new analysis tools. New data include genome sequences and annotation, strand-specific RNA-seq data, splice junction predictions (based on RNA-seq), phosphoproteomic data, high-throughput phenotyping data, single nucleotide polymorphism data based on high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and expression quantitative trait loci data. New analysis tools enable users to search for DNA motifs and define genes based on their genomic colocation, view results from searches graphically (i.e. genes mapped to chromosomes or isolates displayed on a map) and analyze data from columns in result tables (word cloud and histogram summaries of column content). The manuscript herein describes updates to EuPathDB since the previous report published in NAR in 2010.
