TITLE: The TP53 website: an integrative resource centre for the TP53 mutation database and TP53 mutant analysis
 
A novel resource centre for TP53 mutations and mutants has been developed (http://p53.fr). TP53 gene dysfunction can be found in the majority of human cancer types. The potential use of TP53 mutation as a biomarker for clinical studies or exposome analysis has led to the publication of thousands of reports describing the TP53 gene status in >10 000 tumours. The UMD TP53 mutation database was created in 1990 and has been regularly updated. The 2012 release of the database has been carefully curated, and all suspicious reports have been eliminated. It is available either as a flat file that can be easily manipulated or as novel multi-platform analytical software that has been designed to analyse various aspects of TP53 mutations. Several tools to ascertain TP53 mutations are also available for download. We have developed TP53MULTLoad, a manually curated database providing comprehensive details on the properties of 2549 missense TP53 mutants. More than 100 000 entries have been arranged in 39 different activity fields, such as change of transactivation on various promoters, apoptosis or growth arrest. For several hot spot mutants, multiple gain of function activities are also included. The database can be easily browsed via a graphical user interface.
