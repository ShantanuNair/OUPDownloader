TITLE: dictyBase 2013: integrating multiple Dictyostelid species
 
dictyBase (http://dictybase.org) is the model organism database for the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. This contribution provides an update on dictyBase that has been previously presented. During the past 3 years, dictyBase has taken significant strides toward becoming a genome portal for the whole Amoebozoa clade. In its latest release, dictyBase has scaled up to host multiple Dictyostelids, including Dictyostelium purpureum [Sucgang, Kuo, Tian, Salerno, Parikh, Feasley, Dalin, Tu, Huang, Barry et al.(2011) (Comparative genomics of the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum and Dictyostelium purpureum. Genome Biol., 12, R20)], Dictyostelium fasciculatum and Polysphondylium pallidum [Heidel, Lawal, Felder, Schilde, Helps, Tunggal, Rivero, John, Schleicher, Eichinger et al. (2011) (Phylogeny-wide analysis of social amoeba genomes highlights ancient origins for complex intercellular communication. Genome Res., 21, 1882â€“1891)]. The new release includes a new Genome Browser with RNAseq expression, interspecies Basic Local Alignment Search Tool alignments and a unified Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search for cross-species comparisons.
