TITLE: CircaDB: a database of mammalian circadian gene expression profiles
 
CircaDB (http://circadb.org) is a new database of circadian transcriptional profiles from time course expression experiments from mice and humans. Each transcriptâ€™s expression was evaluated by three separate algorithms, JTK_Cycle, Lomb Scargle and DeLichtenberg. Users can query the gene annotations using simple and powerful full text search terms, restrict results to specific data sets and provide probability thresholds for each algorithm. Visualizations of the data are intuitive charts that convey profile information more effectively than a table of probabilities. The CircaDB web application is open source and available at http://github.com/itmat/circadb.
