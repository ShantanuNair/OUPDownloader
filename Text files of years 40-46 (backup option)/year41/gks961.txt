TITLE: Darned in 2013: inclusion of model organisms and linking with Wikipedia
 
DARNED (DAtabase of RNa EDiting, available at http://darned.ucc.ie) is a centralized repository of reference genome coordinates corresponding to RNA nucleotides having altered templated identities in the process of RNA editing. The data in DARNED are derived from published datasets of RNA editing events. RNA editing instances have been identified with various methods, such as bioinformatics screenings, deep sequencing and/or biochemical techniques. Here we report our current progress in the development and expansion of the DARNED. In addition to novel database features the DARNED update describes inclusion of Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus RNA editing events and the launch of a community-based annotation in the RNA WikiProject.
