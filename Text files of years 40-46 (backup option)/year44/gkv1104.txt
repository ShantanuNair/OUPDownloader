TITLE: BioGPS: building your own mash-up of gene annotations and expression profiles
 
BioGPS (http://biogps.org) is a centralized gene-annotation portal that enables researchers to access distributed gene annotation resources. This article focuses on the updates to BioGPS since our last paper (2013 database issue). The unique features of BioGPS, compared to those of other gene portals, are its community extensibility and user customizability. Users contribute the gene-specific resources accessible from BioGPS (‘plugins’), which helps ensure that the resource collection is always up-to-date and that it will continue expanding over time (since the 2013 paper, 162 resources have been added, for a 34% increase in the number of resources available). BioGPS users can create their own collections of relevant plugins and save them as customized gene-report pages or ‘layouts’ (since the 2013 paper, 488 user-created layouts have been added, for a 22% increase in the number of layouts). In addition, we recently updated the most popular plugin, the ‘Gene expression/activity chart’, to include ∼6000 datasets (from ∼2000 datasets) and we enhanced user interactivity. We also added a new ‘gene list’ feature that allows users to save query results for future reference.
