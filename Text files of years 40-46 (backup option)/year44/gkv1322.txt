TITLE: The MG-RAST metagenomics database and portal in 2015
 
MG-RAST (http://metagenomics.anl.gov) is an open-submission data portal for processing, analyzing, sharing and disseminating metagenomic datasets. The system currently hosts over 200 000 datasets and is continuously updated. The volume of submissions has increased 4-fold over the past 24 months, now averaging 4 terabasepairs per month. In addition to several new features, we report changes to the analysis workflow and the technologies used to scale the pipeline up to the required throughput levels. To show possible uses for the data from MG-RAST, we present several examples integrating data and analyses from MG-RAST into popular third-party analysis tools or sequence alignment tools.
