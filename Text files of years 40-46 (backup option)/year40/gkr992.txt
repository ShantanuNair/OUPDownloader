TITLE: ADHDgene: a genetic database for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
 
With a worldwide prevalence of âˆ¼5%, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has become one of the most common psychiatric disorders. The polygenetic nature of ADHD indicates that multiple genes jointly contribute to the development of this complex disease. Studies aiming to explore genetic susceptibility of ADHD have been increasing in recent years. There is a growing need to integrate the genetic data from various genetic studies to provide a comprehensive data set and uniform access for convenience of in-depth data mining. So far, there has been no such effort for ADHD. To address the genetic complexity of ADHD, we developed the ADHDgene database by integrating ADHD-related genetic factors by profound literature reading. Based on the data from the literature, extended functional analysis, including linkage disequilibrium analysis, pathway-based analysis and gene mapping were performed to provide new insights into genetic causes of ADHD. Moreover, powerful search tools and a graphical browser were developed to facilitate the navigation of the data and data connections. As the first genetic database for ADHD, ADHDgene aims to provide researchers with a central genetic resource and analysis platform for ADHD and is freely available at http://adhd.psych.ac.cn/.
