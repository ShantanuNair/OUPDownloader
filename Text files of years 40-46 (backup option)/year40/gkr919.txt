TITLE: SCRIPDB: a portal for easy access to syntheses, chemicals and reactions in patents
 
The patent literature is a rich catalog of biologically relevant chemicals; many public and commercial molecular databases contain the structures disclosed in patent claims. However, patents are an equally rich source of metadata about bioactive molecules, including mechanism of action, disease class, homologous experimental series, structural alternatives, or the synthetic pathways used to produce molecules of interest. Unfortunately, this metadata is discarded when chemical structures are deposited separately in databases. SCRIPDB is a chemical structure database designed to make this metadata accessible. SCRIPDB provides the full original patent text, reactions and relationships described within any individual patent, in addition to the molecular files common to structural databases. We discuss how such information is valuable in medical text mining, chemical image analysis, reaction extraction and in silico pharmaceutical lead optimization. SCRIPDB may be searched by exact chemical structure, substructure or molecular similarity and the results may be restricted to patents describing synthetic routes. SCRIPDB is available at http://dcv.uhnres.utoronto.ca/SCRIPDB.
