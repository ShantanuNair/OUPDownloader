TITLE: EcoliWiki: a wiki-based community resource for Escherichia coli
 
EcoliWiki is the community annotation component of the PortEco (http://porteco.org; formerly EcoliHub) project, an online data resource that integrates information on laboratory strains of Escherichia coli, its phages, plasmids and mobile genetic elements. As one of the early adopters of the wiki approach to model organism databases, EcoliWiki was designed to not only facilitate community-driven sharing of biological knowledge about E. coli as a model organism, but also to be interoperable with other data resources. EcoliWiki content currently covers genes from five laboratory E. coli strains, 21 bacteriophage genomes, F plasmid and eight transposons. EcoliWiki integrates the Mediawiki wiki platform with other open-source software tools and in-house software development to extend how wikis can be used for model organism databases. EcoliWiki can be accessed online at http://ecoliwiki.net.
