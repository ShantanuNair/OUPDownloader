TITLE: Exposome-Explorer: a manually-curated database on biomarkers of exposure to dietary and environmental factors
 
Exposome-Explorer (http://exposome-explorer.iarc.fr) is the first database dedicated to biomarkers of exposure to environmental risk factors. It contains detailed information on the nature of biomarkers, their concentrations in various human biospecimens, the study population where measured and the analytical techniques used for measurement. It also contains correlations with external exposure measurements and data on biological reproducibility over time. The data in Exposome-Explorer was manually collected from peer-reviewed publications and organized to make it easily accessible through a web interface for in-depth analyses. The database and the web interface were developed using the Ruby on Rails framework. A total of 480 publications were analyzed and 10 510 concentration values in blood, urine and other biospecimens for 692 dietary and pollutant biomarkers were collected. Over 8000 correlation values between dietary biomarker levels and food intake as well as 536 values of biological reproducibility over time were also compiled. Exposome-Explorer makes it easy to compare the performance between biomarkers and their fields of application. It should be particularly useful for epidemiologists and clinicians wishing to select panels of biomarkers that can be used in biomonitoring studies or in exposome-wide association studies, thereby allowing them to better understand the etiology of chronic diseases.
