TITLE: mirDNMR: a gene-centered database of background de novo mutation rates in human
 
De novo germline mutations (DNMs) are the rarest genetic variants proven to cause a considerable number of sporadic genetic diseases, such as autism spectrum disorders, epileptic encephalopathy, schizophrenia, congenital heart disease, type 1 diabetes, and hearing loss. However, it is difficult to accurately assess the cause of DNMs and identify disease-causing genes from the considerable number of DNMs in probands. A common method to this problem is to identify genes that harbor significantly more DNMs than expected by chance, with accurate background DNM rate (DNMR) required. Therefore, in this study, we developed a novel database named mirDNMR for the collection of gene-centered background DNMRs obtained from different methods and population variation data. The database has the following functions: (i) browse and search the background DNMRs of each gene predicted by four different methods, including GC content (DNMR-GC), sequence context (DNMR-SC), multiple factors (DNMR-MF) and local DNA methylation level (DNMR-DM); (ii) search variant frequencies in publicly available databases, including ExAC, ESP6500, UK10K, 1000G and dbSNP and (iii) investigate the DNM burden to prioritize candidate genes based on the four background DNMRs using three statistical methods (TADA, Binomial and Poisson test). As a case study, we successfully employed our database in candidate gene prioritization for a sporadic complex disease: intellectual disability. In conclusion, mirDNMR (https://www.wzgenomics.cn/mirdnmr/) can be widely used to identify the genetic basis of sporadic genetic diseases.
