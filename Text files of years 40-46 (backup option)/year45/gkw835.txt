TITLE: LNCediting: a database for functional effects of RNA editing in lncRNAs
 
RNA editing is a widespread post-transcriptional mechanism that can make a single base change on specific nucleotide sequence in an RNA transcript. RNA editing events can result in missense codon changes and modulation of alternative splicing in mRNA, and modification of regulatory RNAs and their binding sites in noncoding RNAs. Recent computational studies accurately detected more than 2 million A-to-I RNA editing sites from next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, the vast majority of these RNA editing sites have unknown functions and are in noncoding regions of the genome. To provide a useful resource for the functional effects of RNA editing in long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), we systematically analyzed the A-to-I editing sites in lncRNAs across human, rhesus, mouse, and fly, and observed an appreciable number of RNA editing sites which can significantly impact the secondary structures of lncRNAs and lncRNAâ€“miRNA interactions. All the data were compiled into LNCediting, a user-friendly database (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/LNCediting/). LNCediting provides customized tools to predict functional effects of novel editing sites in lncRNAs. We hope that it will become an important resource for exploring functions of RNA editing sites in lncRNAs.
