TITLE: CATH: an expanded resource to predict protein function through structure and sequence
 
The latest version of the CATH-Gene3D protein structure classification database has recently been released (version 4.1, http://www.cathdb.info). The resource comprises over 300 000 domain structures and over 53 million protein domains classified into 2737 homologous superfamilies, doubling the number of predicted protein domains in the previous version. The daily-updated CATH-B, which contains our very latest domain assignment data, provides putative classifications for over 100 000 additional protein domains. This article describes developments to the CATH-Gene3D resource over the last two years since the publication in 2015, including: significant increases to our structural and sequence coverage; expansion of the functional families in CATH; building a support vector machine (SVM) to automatically assign domains to superfamilies; improved search facilities to return alignments of query sequences against multiple sequence alignments; the redesign of the web pages and download site.
