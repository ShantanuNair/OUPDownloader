TITLE: FuzDB: database of fuzzy complexes, a tool to develop stochastic structure-function relationships for protein complexes and higher-order assemblies
 
FuzDB (http://protdyn-database.org) compiles experimentally observed fuzzy protein complexes, where intrinsic disorder (ID) is maintained upon interacting with a partner (protein, nucleic acid or small molecule) and directly impacts biological function. Entries in the database have both (i) structural evidence demonstrating the structural multiplicity or dynamic disorder of the ID region(s) in the partner bound form of the protein and (ii) in vitro or in vivo biological evidence that indicates the significance of the fuzzy region(s) in the formation, function or regulation of the assembly. Unlike the other intrinsically disordered or unfolded protein databases, FuzDB focuses on ID regions within a biological context, including higher-order assemblies and presents a detailed analysis of the structural and functional data. FuzDB also provides interpretation of experimental results to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which fuzzy regions—classified on the basis of topology and mechanism—interfere with the structural ensembles and activity of protein assemblies. Regulatory sites generated by alternative splicing (AS) or post-translational modifications (PTMs) are also collected. By assembling all this information, FuzDB could be utilized to develop stochastic structure–function relationships for proteins and could contribute to the emergence of a new paradigm.
