{"keywords": ["catheterization", "ligands", "enzymes"], "abstract": " PROCOGNATE is a database of protein cognate ligands for the domains in enzyme structures as described by CATH, SCOP and Pfam, and is available as an interactive website or a flat file. This article gives an overview of the database and its generation and presents a new website front end, as well as recent increased coverage in our dataset via inclusion of Pfam domains. We also describe navigation of the website and its features. The current version (1.3) of PROCOGNATE covers 4123, 4536, 5876 structures and 377, 326, 695 superfamilies/families in CATH, SCOP and Pfam, respectively.
