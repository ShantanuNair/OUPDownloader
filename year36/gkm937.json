The online PDB archive at ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org is the repository for the coordinates and related information for more than 47 000 structures, including proteins, nucleic acids and large macromolecular complexes that have been determined using X-ray crystallography, NMR and electron microscopy techniques. The members of the wwPDB\u2013RCSB PDB (USA), MSD-EBI (Europe), PDBj (Japan) and BMRB (USA)\u2013have remediated this archive to address inconsistencies that have been introduced over the years. The scope and methods used in this project are presented.", "authors": ["Kim Henrick", "Zukang Feng", "Wolfgang F. Bluhm", "Dimitris Dimitropoulos", "Jurgen F.
