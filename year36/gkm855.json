The database supports analyses for several model organisms, including higher eukaryotes, and enables users to construct 3D maps for other organisms. Data are provided for human and plant ( Arabidopsis ) ribosomes, and for other representative organisms from eubacteria, archaea and eukarya. Additionally, the database integrates information about positions of modifications within rRNA sequences and secondary structures, as well as links to other databases and resources about modifications and their biosynthesis. Displaying positions of modified nucleotides is fully manageable. Views of each modified nucleotide are controlled by individual buttons and buttons also control the visibility of different ribosomal molecular components. A section called \u2018Paint Your Own\u2019 enables the user to create a 3D modification map for rRNA from any organism where sites of modification are known. This section also provides capabilities for visualizing nucleotides of interest in rRNA or tRNA, as well as particular amino acids in ribosomal proteins.
