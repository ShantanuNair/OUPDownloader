{"keywords": ["ligands", "mining", "natural language processing", "technology", "affinity", "crystal structure"], "abstract": " Binding MOAD (Mother of All Databases) is a database of 9836 protein\u2013ligand crystal structures. All biologically relevant ligands are annotated, and experimental binding-affinity data is reported when available. Binding MOAD has almost doubled in size since it was originally introduced in 2004, demonstrating steady growth with each annual update. Several technologies, such as natural language processing, help drive this constant expansion. Along with increasing data, Binding MOAD has improved usability. The website now showcases a faster, more featured viewer to examine the protein\u2013ligand structures. Ligands have additional chemical data, allowing for cheminformatics mining. Lastly, logins are no longer necessary, and Binding MOAD is freely available to all at http://www.BindingMOAD.org . ", "authors": ["Mark L. Benson", "Richard D. Smith", "Nickolay A.
