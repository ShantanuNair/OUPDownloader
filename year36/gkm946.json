RNA-binding proteins and small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to functional elements within 3\u2032UTRs to influence mRNA stability, translation and localization. These interactions play many important roles in development, metabolism and disease. However, even in the most well-annotated metazoan genomes, 3\u2032UTRs and their functional elements are not well defined. Comprehensive and accurate genome-wide annotation of 3\u2032UTRs and their functional elements is thus critical. We have developed an open-access database, available at http://www.UTRome.org , to provide a rich and comprehensive resource for 3\u2032UTR biology in the well-characterized, experimentally tractable model system Caenorhabditis elegans . UTRome.org combines data from public repositories and a large-scale effort we are undertaking to characterize 3\u2032UTRs and their functional elements in C. elegans , including 3\u2032UTR sequences, graphical displays, predicted and validated functional elements, secondary structure predictions and detailed data from our cloning pipeline. UTRome.org will grow substantially over time to encompass individual 3\u2032UTR isoforms for the majority of genes, new and revised functional elements, and in vivo data on 3\u2032UTR function as they become available. The UTRome database thus represents a powerful tool to better understand the biology of 3\u2032UTRs. ", "authors": ["Marco Mangone", "Philip MacMenamin", "Charles Zegar", "Fabio Piano", "Kristin C.
