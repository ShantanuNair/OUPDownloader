Recently, their role in gene regulation and genome evolution has also been discussed widely. We have developed UgMicroSat db (Unigene MicroSatellite d ata b ase), a web-based relational database of microsatellites present in unigene sequences covering 80 genomes. UgMicroSat db allows microsatellite search using multiple parameters like microsatellite type (simple perfect, compound perfect and imperfect), repeat unit length (mono- to hexa-nucleotide), repeat number, microsatellite length and repeat sequence class. Microsatellites can also be retrieved by specifying EST, cDNA, CDS identity or by using Gene Index, GenBank, UniGene IDs. The database also provides information about trinucleotide repeats encoding various amino acids. Such codon repeats can be searched by specifying characteristics of coded amino acids like charge (basic, acidic or neutral), polarity (polar or non-polar), and their hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature. The nucleotide sequences of the target UniGenes are also provided to facilitate primer designing for PCR amplification of the desired microsatellite. UgMicroSat db is available at http://ipu.ac.in/usbt/UgMicroSatdb.htm . ", "authors": ["Veenu Aishwarya", "P. C.
