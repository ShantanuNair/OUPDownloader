{"keywords": ["metadata", "base sequence", "nucleotides"], "abstract": " The Ensembl Trace Archive ( http://trace.ensembl.org/ ) and the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/ ), known together as the European Nucleotide Archive, continue to see growth in data volume and diversity. Selected major developments of 2007 are presented briefly, along with data submission and retrieval information. In the face of increasing requirements for nucleotide trace, sequence and annotation data archiving, data capture priority decisions have been taken at the European Nucleotide Archive. Priorities are discussed in terms of how reliably information can be captured, the long-term benefits of its capture and the ease with which it can be captured.
