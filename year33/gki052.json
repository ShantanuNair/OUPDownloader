The database is organized on the basis of the Arabidopsis gene identifier number. The information provided includes protein description, protein class, whether or not the plant protein has a homologue in the most recent human nucleolar proteome and the results of reciprocal BLAST analysis of the human proteome. In addition, for one-third of the 217 Arabidopsis nucleolar proteins, localization images are available from analysis of full-length cDNA\u2013green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions and the strength of signal in different parts of the cell\u2014nucleolus, nucleolus-associated structures, nucleoplasm, nuclear bodies and extra-nuclear\u2014is provided. For each protein, the most likely human and yeast orthologues, where identifiable through BLASTX analysis, are given with links to relevant information sources. ", "authors": ["John W. S.
