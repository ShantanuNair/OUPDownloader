{"abstract": " DNA methylation plays important roles via regulation of numerous cellular mechanisms in diverse organisms, including humans. The paradigm bacterial methyltransferase (MTase) HhaI (M.HhaI) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from the cofactor S -adenosyl- l -methionine (AdoMet) onto the target cytosine in DNA, yielding 5-methylcytosine and S -adenosyl- l -homocysteine (AdoHcy). The turnover rate ( kcat ) of M.HhaI, and the other two cytosine-5 MTases examined, is limited by a step subsequent to methyl transfer; however, no such step has so far been identified. To elucidate the role of cofactor interactions during catalysis, eight mutants of Trp41, which is located in the cofactor binding pocket, were constructed and characterized. The mutants show full proficiency in DNA binding and base-flipping, and little variation is observed in the apparent methyl transfer rate kchem as determined by rapid-quench experiments using immobilized fluorescent-labeled DNA. However, the Trp41 replacements with short side chains substantially perturb cofactor binding (100-fold higher  \\( {K}_{\\hbox{ D }}^{\\hbox{ AdoMet }} \\)  and  \\( {K}_{\\hbox{ M }}^{\\hbox{ AdoMet }}\\)  ) leading to a faster turnover of the enzyme (10-fold higher kcat ). Our analysis indicates that the rate-limiting breakdown of a long-lived ternary product complex is initiated by the dissociation of AdoHcy or the opening of the catalytic loop in the enzyme.
