{"keywords": ["echocardiography", "genes", "genome", "enzymes", "proteomics", "escherichia coli"], "abstract": "Echo BASE ( http://www.ecoli-york.org ) is a relational database designed to contain and manipulate information from post-genomic experiments using the model bacterium Escherichia coli K-12. Its aim is to collate information from a wide range of sources to provide clues to the functions of the approximately 1500 gene products that have no confirmed cellular function. The database is built on an enhanced annotation of the updated genome sequence of strain MG1655 and the association of experimental data with the E.coli genes and their products. Experiments that can be held within Echo BASE include proteomics studies, microarray data, protein\u2013protein interaction data, structural data and bioinformatics studies. Echo BASE also contains annotated information on \u2018orphan\u2019 enzyme activities from this microbe to aid characterization of the proteins that catalyse these elusive biochemical reactions.
