The experimental data include large amounts of mass spectrometry results from protein co-purification experiments, yeast two-hybrid interaction experiments, fluorescence microscopy images and protein structure predictions. All of the data are accessible via searching by gene or protein name, and are available on the Web at http://www.yeastrc.org/pdr/ . ", "authors": ["Michael Riffle", "Lars Malmstr\u00f6m", "Trisha N.
