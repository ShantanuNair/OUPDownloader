{"keywords": ["cpg islands", "exons", "introns", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "untranslated regions"], "abstract": " We have created the Functional Element SNPs Database (FESD) that categorizes functional elements in human genic regions and provides a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within each area. In the FESD, the human genic regions were divided into 10 different functional elements, such as promoter regions, CpG islands, 5\u2032-untranslated regions (5\u2032-UTRs), translation start sites, splice sites, coding exons, introns, translation stop sites, polyadenylation signals and 3\u2032-UTRs, and subsequently, all the known SNPs were assigned to each functional element at their respective position. With the FESD web interface, users can select a set of SNPs in the specific functional elements and get their flanking sequences for genotyping experiments, which will help in finding mutations that contribute to the common and polygenic diseases. A web interface for the FESD is freely available at http://combio.kribb.re.kr/ksnp/resd/ .
