This database displays the observed frequencies of individual 5\u2032 end SAGE tags and previously unknown transcription start sites in the promoter regions, introns and intergenic regions of known genes. 5\u2032SAGE will be useful for analyzing promoter regions and start site variation in different tissues, and is freely available at http://5sage.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ .
