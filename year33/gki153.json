{"abstract": " Mouse proline-rich RNA-binding protein (mPrrp) is a mouse ortholog of Xenopus Prrp, which binds to a vegetal localization element (VLE) in the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) of Vg1 mRNA and is expected to be involved in the transport and/or localization of Vg1 mRNA to the vegetal cortex of oocytes. In mouse testis, mPrrp protein is abundantly expressed in the nuclei of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, and shifts to the cytoplasm in elongating spermatids. To gain an insight into the function of mPrrp in male germ cells, we performed in vitro RNA selection (SELEX) to determine the RNA ligand sequence of mPrrp. This analysis revealed that many of the selected clones contained both of two conserved elements, AAAUAG and GU 1\u20133 AG. RNA-binding study on deletion mutants and secondary structure analyses of the selected RNA revealed that a two-loop structure containing the conserved elements is required for high-affinity binding to mPrrp. Furthermore, we found that the target mRNAs of Xenopus Prrp contain intact AAAUAG and GU 1\u20133 AG sequences in the 3\u2032-UTR, suggesting that these binding sequences are shared by Prrps of Xenopus and mouse.
