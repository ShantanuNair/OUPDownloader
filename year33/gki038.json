Updated monthly, these services are made available through the RDP-II website ( http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/ ). RDP-II release 9.21 (August 2004) contains 101\u2009632 bacterial small subunit rRNA gene sequences in aligned and annotated format. High-throughput tools for initial taxonomic placement, identification of related sequences, probe and primer testing, data navigation and subalignment download are provided.
