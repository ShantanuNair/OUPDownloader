{"keywords": ["genome", "taxonomic classification"], "abstract": " Several proteins that have substantially diverged during evolution retain similar three-dimensional structures and biological function inspite of poor sequence identity. The database on Genomic Distribution of protein structural domain Superfamilies (GenDiS) provides record for the distribution of 4001 protein domains organized as 1194 structural superfamilies across 18\u2009997 genomes at various levels of hierarchy in taxonomy. GenDiS database provides a survey of protein domains enlisted in sequence databases employing a 3-fold sequence search approach. Lineage-specific literature is obtained from the taxonomy database for individual protein members to provide a platform for performing genomic and phyletic studies across organisms. The database documents residual properties and provides alignments for the various superfamily members in genomes, offering insights into the rational design of experiments and for the better understanding of a superfamily. GenDiS database can be accessed at http://www.ncbs.res.in/~faculty/mini/gendis/home.html .
