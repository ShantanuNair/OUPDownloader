We recently created a database containing 159\u2009921 transcripts from human, mouse, rat, zebrafish and fugu species. Approximately 16\u2009000 homology groups were identified with the help of Ensembl homology evidence. At the macro-level, the database allows us to answer queries of the form:  What is the average k -distance between 5\u2032 untranslated regions of human and mouse?  List the 10 groups with the highest Ka / Ks ratio between mouse and rat. List all identical proteins between human and rat. Researchers interested in specific proteins can use a simple web interface to retrieve the homology groups of interest, examine all pairwise distances between members of the group and study the conservation of exon\u2013intron gene structures using a graphical interface. The database is available at http://warta.bio.psu.edu/DED/ .
