The LIS virtual plant interface allows simplified and intuitive navigation of transcript data from Medicago truncatula , Lotus japonicus , Glycine max and Arabidopsis thaliana . Transcript libraries are represented as images of plant organs in different developmental stages, which are selected to query the analyzed and annotated data. Complex queries can be accomplished by adding modifiers, keywords and sequence names. The LIS also contains annotated genomic data featuring transcript alignments to validate gene predictions as well as motif and similarity analyses. The genomic browser supports comparative analysis via novel dynamic functional annotation comparisons. CMap, developed as part of the GMOD project ( http://www.gmod.org/cmap/index.shtml ), has been incorporated to support comparative analyses of community linkage and physical map data. LIS is being expanded to incorporate gene expression and biochemical pathways which will be seamlessly integrated forming a knowledge discovery framework. ", "authors": ["Michael D.
