GALA, the database of Genome ALignments and Annotations, is now a set of interlinked relational databases for five vertebrate species, human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat and chicken. For each species, GALA records pairwise and multiple sequence alignments, scores derived from those alignments that reflect the likelihood of being under purifying selection or being a regulatory element, and extensive annotations such as genes, gene expression patterns and transcription factor binding sites. The user interface supports simple and complex queries, including operations such as subtraction and intersections as well as clustering and finding elements in proximity to features. dbERGE II, the database of Experimental Results on Gene Expression, contains experimental data from a variety of functional assays. Both databases are now run on the DB2 database management system. Improved hardware and tuning has reduced response times and increased querying capacity, while simplified query interfaces will help direct new users through the querying process.
