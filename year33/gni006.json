{"abstract": " The Gal4\u2013UAS enhancer trap system is useful for driving gene expression in various tissues. A new tool that extends Gal4 technology is described here. A fusion protein containing the Gal4 binding domain and the repression domain of the isolator suppressor of hairy wing was placed under the control of a heat shock-inducible promoter. The construct mediates the conditional repression of genes located downstream of a UAS sequence. The repressive effects of the chimeric protein on fasII gene expression were tested by western-blot analysis and in brain sections of adult Drosophila . Owing to the increasing number of Gal4 and UAS transgenic lines, this versatile system will facilitate the study of gene function.
