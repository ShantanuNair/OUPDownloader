{"abstract": "Phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASOs) are used to suppress gene expression by inducing RNase H-mediated cleavage with subsequent degradation of the target mRNA. However, previous observations suggest that ASO/RNase H can also result in the generation of stable mRNA cleavage fragments and expression of truncated proteins. Here, we addressed the underlying translational mechanisms in more detail using hepadnavirus-transfected hepatoma cells as a model system of antisense therapy. Generation of stable mRNA cleavage fragments was restricted to the ASO/RNase H pathway and not observed upon cotransfection of isosequential small interfering RNA or RNase H-incompetent oligonucleotides. Furthermore, direct evidence for translation of mRNA fragments was established by polysome analysis. Polysome-associated RNA contained cleavage fragments devoid of a 5\u2032 cap structure indicating that translation was, at least in part, cap-independent. Further analysis of the uncapped cleavage fragments revealed that their 5\u2032 terminus and initiation codon were only separated by a few nucleotides suggesting a 5\u2032 end-dependent mode of translation, whereas internal initiation could be ruled out. However, the efficiency of translation was moderate compared to uncleaved mRNA and amounted to 13\u201324% depending on the ASO used. These findings provide a rationale for understanding the translation of mRNA fragments generated by ASO/RNase H mechanistically.", "authors": ["Peter Hasselblatt", "Birgit Hockenjos", "Christian Thoma", "Hubert E.
