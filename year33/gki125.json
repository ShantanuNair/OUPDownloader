{"keywords": ["dna", "genes", "genome", "genetics", "mice", "rats", "maps", "quantitative trait loci"], "abstract": " The rat genome database RatMap ( http://ratmap.org or http://ratmap.gen.gu.se ) has been one of the main resources for rat genome information since 1994. The database is maintained by CMB\u2013Genetics at G\u00f6teborg University in Sweden and provides information on rat genes, polymorphic rat DNA-markers and rat quantitative trait loci (QTLs), all curated at RatMap. The database is under the supervision of the Rat Gene and Nomenclature Committee (RGNC); thus much attention is paid to rat gene nomenclature. RatMap presents information on rat idiograms, karyotypes and provides a unified presentation of the rat genome sequence and integrated rat linkage maps. A set of tools is also available to facilitate the identification and characterization of rat QTLs, as well as the estimation of exon/intron number and sizes in individual rat genes. Furthermore, comparative gene maps of rat in regard to mouse and human are provided. ", "authors": ["Greta Petersen", "Per Johnson", "Lars Andersson", "Karin Klinga-Levan", "Pedro M.
