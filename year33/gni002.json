{"abstract": " Using a microarray that tiles all known yeast non-coding RNAs, we compared RNA from wild-type cells with RNA from mutants encoding known and putative RNA modifying enzymes. We show that at least five types of RNA modification (dihydrouridine, m 1 G,  \\( {\\hbox{ m }}_{2}^{2}\\hbox{ G } \\)  , m 1 A and  \\( {\\hbox{ m }}_{2}^{6}\\hbox{ A } \\)  ) catalyzed by 10 different enzymes (Trm1p, Trm5, Trm10p, Dus1p-Dus4p, Dim1p, Gcd10p and Gcd14p) can be detected by virtue of differential hybridization to oligonucleotides on the array that are complementary to the modified sites. Using this approach, we identified a previously undetected m 1 A modification in GlnCTG tRNA, the formation of which is catalyzed by the Gcd10/Gcd14 complex. ", "authors": ["Shawna L.
