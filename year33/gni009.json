{"abstract": "DNA helicases play essential roles in many cellular processes. The currently available techniques to generate substrates for helicase assays are fairly complicated and need some expertise not available in all laboratories. Here, a PCR-based method to generate a substrate for a helicase assay is described, and its application for several archaeal, bacterial and viral enzymes is demonstrated.", "authors": ["Jae-Ho Shin", "John N.
