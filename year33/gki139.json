{"keywords": ["internet", "molecular biology", "nucleic acids", "organelles", "plants", "immunology"], "abstract": " The Nucleic Acids Research Molecular Biology Database Collection is a public online resource that lists the databases described in this and previous issues of Nucleic Acids Research together with other databases of value to the biologist and available throughout the world. All databases included in this Collection are freely available to the public. The 2005 update includes 719 databases, 171 more than the 2004 one. The databases are organized in a hierarchical classification that simplifies the process of finding the right database for any given task. The growing number of databases related to immunology, plant and organelle research have been accommodated by separating them into three new categories. The database summaries provide brief descriptions of the databases, contact details, appropriate references and acknowledgements. The online summaries also serve as a venue for the maintainers of each database to introduce database updates and other improvements in the scope and tools. These updates are particularly important for those databases that have not been described in print in the recent past. The database list and summaries are available online at the Nucleic Acids Research web site, http://nar.oupjournals.org/ . ", "authors": ["Michael Y.
