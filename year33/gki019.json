{"keywords": ["amino acid sequence", "genes", "genome", "bioinformatics"], "abstract": " The PEDANT genome database ( http://pedant.gsf.de ) contains pre-computed bioinformatics analyses of publicly available genomes. Its main mission is to provide robust automatic annotation of the vast majority of amino acid sequences, which have not been subjected to in-depth manual curation by human experts in high-quality protein sequence databases. By design PEDANT annotation is genome-oriented, making it possible to explore genomic context of gene products, and evaluate functional and structural content of genomes using a category-based query mechanism. At present, the PEDANT database contains exhaustive annotation of over 1\u2009240\u2009000 proteins from 270 eubacterial, 23 archeal and 41 eukaryotic genomes. ", "authors": ["M.
