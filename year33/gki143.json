{"abstract": " DNA triplexes are formed by both isomorphic (structurally alike) and non-isomorphic (structurally dissimilar) base triplets. It is espoused here that (i) the base triplet non-isomorphism may be articulated in structural terms by a residual twist (\u0394 t \u00b0), the angle formed by line joining the C1\u2032\u2026C1\u2032 atoms of the adjacent Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen (RH) base pairs and the difference in base triplet radius (\u0394 r \u00c5), and (ii) their influence on DNA triplex is largely mechanistic, leading to the prediction of a high ( t + \u0394 t )\u00b0 and low ( t \u2212 \u0394 t )\u00b0 twist at the successive steps of Hoogsteen or RH duplex of a parallel or antiparallel triplex. Efficacy of this concept is corroborated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of an antiparallel DNA triplex comprising alternating non-isomorphic G*GC and T*AT triplets. Conformational changes necessitated by base triplet non-isomorphism are found to induce an alternating (i) high anti and anti glycosyl and (ii) BII and an unusual BIII conformation resulting in a zigzag backbone for the RH strand. Thus, base triplet non-isomorphism causes DNA triplexes into exhibiting sequence-dependent non-uniform conformation. Such structural variations may be relevant in deciphering the specificity of interaction with DNA triplex binding proteins. Seemingly then, residual twist (\u0394 t \u00b0) and radial difference (\u0394 r \u00c5) suffice as indices to define and monitor the effect of base triplet non-isomorphism in nucleic acid triplexes.
