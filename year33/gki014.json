{"keywords": ["arabidopsis", "clone cells", "dna, complementary", "genome", "dna transposons"], "abstract": " The RIKEN Arabidopsis Genome Encyclopedia (RARGE) database houses information on biological resources ranging from transcriptome to phenome, including RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length (RAFL) complementary DNAs (cDNAs), their promoter regions, Dissociation ( Ds ) transposon-tagged lines and expression data from microarray experiments. RARGE provides tools for searching by resource code, sequence homology or keyword, and rapid access to detailed information on the resources. We have isolated 245\u2009946 RAFL cDNA clones and collected 11\u2009933 transposon-tagged lines, which are available from the RIKEN Bioresource Center and are stored in RARGE. The RARGE web interface can be accessed at http://rarge.gsc.riken.jp/ . Additionally, we report 90\u2009000 new RAFL cDNA clones here.
