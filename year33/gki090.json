For each of these gene families, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates ( Ka / Ks ), mappings from gene trees to the NCBI taxonomy and structural links to solved three-dimensional protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with Grantham-weighted mutational factors were all calculated. Of the \u2018gene family trees\u2019, 173 embryophyte and 505 chordate branches show Ka / Ks \u226b 1 and are candidates for functional adaptation. The calculated information is available both as a gene family database and as a phylogenetically indexed resource, called \u2018The Adaptive Evolution Database\u2019 (TAED), available at http://www.bioinfo.no/tools/TAED .
