{"abstract": "Transcription factors, chromatin components and chromatin modification activities are involved in many diseases including cancer. However, the means by which alterations in these factors influence the epigenotype of specific cell types is poorly understood. One problem that limits progress is that regulatory regions of eukaryotic genes sometimes extend over large regions of DNA. To improve chromatin structure\u2013function analysis over such large regions, we have developed an automated, relatively simple procedure that uses magnetic beads and a capillary sequencer for ligation-mediated-PCR (LM-PCR). We show that the procedure can be used for the rapid examination of chromatin fine-structure, nucleosome positioning as well as changes in transcription factor binding-site occupancy during cellular differentiation.", "authors": ["Richard Ingram", "Hiromi Tagoh", "Arthur D.
