These include microRNAs (miRNAs), which act as regulatory factors during growth and development, and short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which function in several epigenetic and post-transcriptional silencing systems. The Arabidopsis Small RNA Project (ASRP) seeks to characterize and functionally analyze the major classes of endogenous small RNAs in plants. The ASRP database provides a repository for sequences of small RNAs cloned from various Arabidopsis genotypes and tissues. Version 3.0 of the database contains 1920 unique sequences, with tools to assist in miRNA and siRNA identification and analysis. The comprehensive database is publicly available through a web interface at http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu . ", "authors": ["Adam M.
