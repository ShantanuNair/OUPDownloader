{"abstract": " We have recently sequenced the genome of a novel thermophilic bacteriophage designated as TS2126 that infects the thermophilic eubacterium Thermus scotoductus . One of the annotated open reading frames (ORFs) shows homology to T4 RNA ligase 1, an enzyme of great importance in molecular biology, owing to its ability to ligate single-stranded nucleic acids. The ORF was cloned, and recombinant protein was expressed, purified and characterized. The recombinant enzyme ligates single-stranded nucleic acids in an ATP-dependent manner and is moderately thermostable. The recombinant enzyme exhibits extremely high activity and high ligation efficiency. It can be used for various molecular biology applications including RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE). The TS2126 RNA ligase catalyzed both inter- and intra-molecular single-stranded DNA ligation to >50% completion in a matter of hours at an elevated temperature, although favoring intra-molecular ligation on RNA and single-stranded DNA substrates. The properties of TS2126 RNA ligase 1 makes it very attractive for processes like adaptor ligation, and single-stranded solid phase gene synthesis.
