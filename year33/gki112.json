The present release of the SBASE A library of protein domain sequences contains 972\u2009397 protein sequence segments annotated by structure, function, ligand-binding or cellular topology, clustered into 8547 domain groups. SBASE B contains 169\u2009916 domain sequences clustered into 2526 less well-characterized groups. Domain prediction is based on an evaluation of database search results in comparison with a \u2018similarity network\u2019 of inter-sequence similarity scores, using support vector machines trained on similarity search results of known domains.
