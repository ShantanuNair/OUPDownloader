{"keywords": ["carbohydrates", "glycoprotein"], "abstract": " Knowledge of the 3D structure of glycoproteins and protein\u2013carbohydrate complexes is indispensable to fully understand the biological processes they are involved in. Carbohydrate Structure Suite is an attempt to automatically analyse carbohydrate structures contained in the PDB and make the results publicly available on the internet. Characteristic torsion angles, glycoprotein sequences and carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions are analysed. Furthermore, tools to crosslink the PDB and carbohydrate databases and to check the integrity of carbohydrate 3D structures are included. The service is available at ( www.dkfz.de/spec/css/ ).
