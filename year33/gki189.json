{"abstract": " Rev1 is a deoxycytidyl transferase associated with DNA translesion synthesis (TLS). In addition to its catalytic domain, Rev1 possesses a so-called BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain. Here, we describe cells and mice containing a targeted deletion of this domain.  Rev1 B/B mice are healthy, fertile and display normal somatic hypermutation.  Rev1 B/B cells display an elevated spontaneous frequency of intragenic deletions at Hprt . In addition, these cells were sensitized to exogenous DNA damages. Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light induced a delayed progression through late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and many chromatid aberrations, specifically in a subset of mutant cells, but not enhanced sister chromatid exchanges (SCE). UV-C-induced mutagenesis was reduced and mutations at thymidine\u2013thymidine dimers were absent in  Rev1 B/B cells, the opposite phenotype of UV-C-exposed cells from XP-V patients, lacking TLS polymerase \u03b7. This suggests that the enhanced UV-induced mutagenesis in XP-V patients may depend on error-prone Rev1-dependent TLS. Together, these data indicate a regulatory role of the Rev1 BRCT domain in TLS of a limited spectrum of endogenous and exogenous nucleotide damages during a defined phase of the cell cycle.
