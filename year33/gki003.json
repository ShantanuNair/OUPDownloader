CGD is a public resource for the research community that is interested in the molecular biology of this fungus. CGD curators are in the process of combing the scientific literature to collect all C.albicans gene names and aliases; to assign gene ontology terms that describe the molecular function, biological process, and subcellular localization of each gene product; to annotate mutant phenotypes; and to summarize the function and biological context of each gene product in free-text description lines. CGD also provides community resources, including a reservation system for gene names and a colleague registry through which Candida researchers can share contact information and research interests. CGD is publicly funded (by NIH grant R01 DE15873-01 from the NIDCR) and is freely available at http://www.candidagenome.org/ . ", "authors": ["Martha B. Arnaud", "Maria C. Costanzo", "Marek S.
