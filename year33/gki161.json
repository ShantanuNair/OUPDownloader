{"abstract": "Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plays a key role in myeloid cell function and is rapidly and transiently expressed in T cells in response to immune or inflammatory stimuli. Induction of GM-CSF gene expression is accompanied by changes in chromatin structure across the proximal promoter region of the gene. We show that the promoter remodelling and subsequent gene transcription occurs with distinct signal and transcription factor requirements. Activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) signalling pathway is sufficient to induce changes in chromatin structure across the promoter, but both the PKC and calcium signalling pathways are required for efficient gene transcription. Although NFAT transcription factors contribute to GM-CSF gene transcription, they are not required for promoter remodelling. However, the presence of the nuclear factor-\u03baB transcription factor, c-Rel, in the nucleus is strongly correlated with and required for the events of chromatin remodelling.", "authors": ["Kate H.
