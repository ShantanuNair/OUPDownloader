{"keywords": ["genes", "internet", "tertiary protein structure", "yeasts"], "abstract": " The database of 3D Interacting Domains (3did) is a collection of domain\u2013domain interactions in proteins for which high-resolution three-dimensional structures are known. 3did exploits structural information to provide critical molecular details necessary for understanding how interactions occur. It also offers an overview of how similar in structure are interactions between different members of the same protein family. The database also contains Gene Ontology-based functional annotations and interactions between yeast proteins from large-scale interaction discovery studies. A web-based tool to query 3did is available at http://3did.embl.de . ", "authors": ["Amelie Stein", "Robert B.
