MicroRNAs are important regulators of gene expression, achieved by binding to the gene to be regulated. Even with modern high-throughput technologies, it is laborious and expensive to detect all possible microRNA targets. For this reason, several computational microRNA–target prediction tools have been developed, each with its own strengths and limitations. Integration of different tools has been a successful approach to minimize the shortcomings of individual databases. Here, we present mirDIP v4.1, providing nearly 152 million human microRNA–target predictions, which were collected across 30 different resources. We also introduce an integrative score, which was statistically inferred from the obtained predictions, and was assigned to each unique microRNA–target interaction to provide a unified measure of confidence. We demonstrate that integrating predictions across multiple resources does not cumulate prediction bias toward biological processes or pathways. mirDIP v4.1 is freely available at http://ophid.utoronto.ca/mirDIP/.
