There is a significant number of children around the world suffering from the consequence of the misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment for various diseases. To facilitate the precision medicine in pediatrics, a database namely the Pediatric Disease Annotations & Medicines (PedAM) has been built to standardize and classify pediatric diseases. The PedAM integrates both biomedical resources and clinical data from Electronic Medical Records to support the development of computational tools, by which enables robust data analysis and integration. It also uses disease-manifestation (D-M) integrated from existing biomedical ontologies as prior knowledge to automatically recognize text-mined, D-M-specific syntactic patterns from 774 514 full-text articles and 8 848 796 abstracts in MEDLINE. Additionally, disease connections based on phenotypes or genes can be visualized on the web page of PedAM. Currently, the PedAM contains standardized 8528 pediatric disease terms (4542 unique disease concepts and 3986 synonyms) with eight annotation fields for each disease, including definition synonyms, gene, symptom, cross-reference (Xref), human phenotypes and its corresponding phenotypes in the mouse. The database PedAM is freely accessible at http://www.unimd.org/pedam/.
