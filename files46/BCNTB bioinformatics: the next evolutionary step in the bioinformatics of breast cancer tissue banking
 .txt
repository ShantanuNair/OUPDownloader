Here, we present an update of Breast Cancer Now Tissue Bank bioinformatics, a rich platform for the sharing, mining, integration and analysis of breast cancer data. Its modalities provide researchers with access to a centralised information gateway from which they can access a network of bioinformatic resources to query findings from publicly available, in-house and experimental data generated using samples supplied from the Breast Cancer Now Tissue Bank. This in silico environment aims to help researchers use breast cancer data to their full potential, irrespective of any bioinformatics barriers. For this new release, a complete overhaul of the IT and bioinformatic infrastructure underlying the portal has been conducted and a host of novel analytical modules established. We developed and adopted an automated data selection and prioritisation system, expanded the data content and included tissue and cell line data generated from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, designed a host of novel analytical modalities and enhanced the query building process. Furthermore, the results are presented in an interactive format, providing researchers with greater control over the information on which they want to focus.
