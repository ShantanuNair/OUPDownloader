Biological networks provide new opportunities for understanding the cellular biology in both health and disease states. We generated tissue specific integrated networks (INs) for liver, muscle and adipose tissues by integrating metabolic, regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks. We also generated human co-expression networks (CNs) for 46 normal tissues and 17 cancers to explore the functional relationships between genes as well as their relationships with biological functions, and investigate the overlap between functional and physical interactions provided by CNs and INs, respectively. These networks can be employed in the analysis of omics data, provide detailed insight into disease mechanisms by identifying the key biological components and eventually can be used in the development of efficient treatment strategies. Moreover, comparative analysis of the networks may allow for the identification of tissue-specific targets that can be used in the development of drugs with the minimum toxic effect to other human tissues. These context-specific INs and CNs are presented in an interactive website http://inetmodels.com without any limitation.
