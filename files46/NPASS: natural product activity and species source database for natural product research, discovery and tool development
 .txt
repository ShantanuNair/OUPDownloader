There has been renewed interests in the exploration of natural products (NPs) for drug discovery, and continuous investigations of the therapeutic claims and mechanisms of traditional and herbal medicines. In-silico methods have been employed for facilitating these studies. These studies and the optimization of in-silico algorithms for NP applications can be facilitated by the quantitative activity and species source data of the NPs. A number of databases collectively provide the structural and other information of ∼470 000 NPs, including qualitative activity information for many NPs, but only ∼4000 NPs are with the experimental activity values. There is a need for the activity and species source data of more NPs. We therefore developed a new database, NPASS (Natural Product Activity and Species Source) to complement other databases by providing the experimental activity values and species sources of 35 032 NPs from 25 041 species targeting 5863 targets (2946 proteins, 1352 microbial species and 1227 cell-lines). NPASS contains 446 552 quantitative activity records (e.g. IC50, Ki, EC50, GI50 or MIC mainly in units of nM) of 222 092 NP-target pairs and 288 002 NP-species pairs. NPASS, http://bidd2.nus.edu.sg/NPASS/, is freely accessible with its contents searchable by keywords, physicochemical property range, structural similarity, species and target search facilities.
