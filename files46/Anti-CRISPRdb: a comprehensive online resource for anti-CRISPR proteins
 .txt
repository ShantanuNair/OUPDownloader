CRISPR-Cas is a tool that is widely used for gene editing. However, unexpected off-target effects may occur as a result of long-term nuclease activity. Anti-CRISPR proteins, which are powerful molecules that inhibit the CRISPRâ€“Cas system, may have the potential to promote better utilization of the CRISPR-Cas system in gene editing, especially for gene therapy. Additionally, more in-depth research on these proteins would help researchers to better understand the co-evolution of bacteria and phages. Therefore, it is necessary to collect and integrate data on various types of anti-CRISPRs. Herein, data on these proteins were manually gathered through data screening of the literatures. Then, the first online resource, anti-CRISPRdb, was constructed for effectively organizing these proteins. It contains the available protein sequences, DNA sequences, coding regions, source organisms, taxonomy, virulence, protein interactors and their corresponding three-dimensional structures. Users can access our database at http://cefg.uestc.edu.cn/anti-CRISPRdb/ without registration. We believe that the anti-CRISPRdb can be used as a resource to facilitate research on anti-CRISPR proteins and in related fields.
