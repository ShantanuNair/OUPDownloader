Chemical mapping is a broadly utilized technique for probing the structure and function of RNAs. The volume of chemical mapping data continues to grow as more researchers routinely employ this information and as experimental methods increase in throughput and information content. To create a central location for these data, we established an RNA mapping database (RMDB) 5 years ago. The RMDB, which is available at http://rmdb.stanford.edu, now contains chemical mapping data for over 800 entries, involving 134 000 natural and engineered RNAs, in vitro and in cellulo. The entries include large data sets from multidimensional techniques that focus on RNA tertiary structure and co-transcriptional folding, resulting in over 15 million residues probed. The database interface has been redesigned and now offers interactive graphical browsing of structural, thermodynamic and kinetic data at single-nucleotide resolution. The front-end interface now uses the force-directed RNA applet for secondary structure visualization and other JavaScript-based views of bar graphs and annotations. A new interface also streamlines the process for depositing new chemical mapping data to the RMDB.
