Each repository has its own data format, molecule identifier and supplementary information. Michigan Molecular Interactions (MiMI) assists scientists searching through this overwhelming amount of protein interaction data. MiMI gathers data from well-known protein interaction databases and deep-merges the information. Utilizing an identity function, molecules that may have different identifiers but represent the same real-world object are merged. Thus, MiMI allows the users to retrieve information from many different databases at once, highlighting complementary and contradictory information. To help scientists judge the usefulness of a piece of data, MiMI tracks the provenance of all data. Finally, a simple yet powerful user interface aids users in their queries, and frees them from the onerous task of knowing the data format or learning a query language. MiMI allows scientists to query all data, whether corroborative or contradictory, and specify which sources to utilize. MiMI is part of the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI) and is publicly available at: .", "authors": ["Magesh Jayapandian", "Adriane Chapman", "V.
