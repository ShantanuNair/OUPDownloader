MamPol, \u2018Mammalia Polymorphism Database\u2019, is a website containing all the well-annotated polymorphic sequences available in GenBank for the Mammalia class grouped by name of organism and gene. Diversity measures of single nucleotide polymorphisms are provided for each set of haplotypic homologous sequences, including polymorphism at synonymous and non-synonymous sites, linkage disequilibrium and codon bias. Data gathering, calculation of diversity measures and daily updates are automatically performed using PDA software. The MamPol website includes several interfaces for browsing the contents of the database and making customizable comparative searches of different species or taxonomic groups. It also contains a set of tools for simple re-analysis of the available data and a statistics section that is updated daily and summarizes the contents of the database. MamPol is available at  and can be downloaded via FTP.", "authors": ["Raquel Egea", "S\u00f2nia Casillas", "Enol Fern\u00e1ndez", "Miquel \u00c0ngel Senar", "Antonio Barbadilla"], "about": ["polymorphism", "codon nucleotides", "genes", "linkage disequilibrium", "mammals", "nucleotides", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "software", "genetics", "genbank", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "MamPol: a database of nucleotide polymorphism in the Mammalia class\r\n "}
