Besides our own experimental metabolome, proteome and transcriptome data, various additional predictions of cellular processes, such as gene-regulatory networks were stored. Reconstruction of metabolic networks in SYSTOMONAS was achieved via comparative genomics. Broad data integration is realized using SOAP interfaces for the well established databases BRENDA, KEGG and PRODORIC. Several tools for the analysis of stored data and for the visualization of the corresponding results are provided, enabling a quick understanding of metabolic pathways, genomic arrangements or promoter structures of interest. The focus of SYSTOMONAS is on pseudomonads and in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen. With this database we would like to encourage the Pseudomonas community to elucidate cellular processes of interest using an integrated systems biology strategy. The database is accessible at .", "authors": ["Claudia Choi", "Richard M\u00fcnch", "Stefan Leupold", "Johannes Klein", "Inga Siegel", "Bernhard Thielen", "Beatrice Benkert", "Martin Kucklick", "Max Schobert", "Jens Barthelmes", "Christian Ebeling", "Isam Haddad", "Maurice Scheer", "Andreas Grote", "Karsten Hiller", "Boyke Bunk", "Kerstin Schreiber", "Ida Retter", "Dietmar Schomburg", "Dieter Jahn"], "about": ["pseudomonas aeruginosa", "biotechnology", "genes", "genome", "genomics", "proteome", "pseudomonas", "reconstructive surgical procedures", "infection", "pathogenic organism", "community", "systems biology", "bioinformatics", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "SYSTOMONAS \u2014 an integrated database for systems biology analysis of Pseudomonas\n "}
