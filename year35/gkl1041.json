To decipher gene regulatory networks (GRNs) we require a comprehensive and accurate knowledge of transcriptional regulatory elements. TRED () was designed as a resource for gene regulation and function studies. It collects mammalian cis- and trans-regulatory elements together with experimental evidence. All the regulatory elements were mapped on to the assembled genomes. In this new release, we included a total of 36 TF families involved in cancer. Accordingly, the number of target promoters and genes for TF families has increased dramatically. There are 11\u2009660 target genes (7479 in human, 2691 in mouse and 1490 in rat) and 14\u2009908 target promoters (10\u2009225 in human, 2985 in mouse and 1698 in rat). Additionally, we constructed GRNs for each TF family by connecting the TF\u2013target gene pairs. Such interaction data between TFs and their target genes will assist detailed functional studies and help to obtain a panoramic view of the GRNs for cancer research.", "authors": ["C. Jiang", "Z.
