{"keywords": ["protein folding", "thermodynamics", "kinetics"], "abstract": "The Protein Folding Database (PFD) is a publicly accessible repository of thermodynamic and kinetic protein folding data. Here we describe the first major revision of this work, featuring extensive restructuring that conforms to standards set out by the recently formed International Foldeomics Consortium. The database now adopts standards for data acquisition, analysis and reporting proposed by the consortium, which will facilitate the comparison of folding rates, energies and structure across diverse sets of proteins. Data can now be easily deposited using a rich set of deposition tools. Enhanced search tools allow sophisticated searching and graphical data analysis affords simple data analysis online. PFD can be accessed freely at .", "authors": ["Kate F. Fulton", "Mark A. Bate", "Noel G. Faux", "Khalid Mahmood", "Chris Betts", "Ashley M.
