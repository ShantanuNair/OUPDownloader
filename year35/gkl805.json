{"keywords": ["amino acids", "genome", "membrane proteins"], "abstract": "We have developed the database, TMBETA-GENOME, for annotated \u03b2-barrel membrane proteins in genomic sequences using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. The statistical methods are based on amino acid composition, reside pair preference and motifs. In machine learning techniques, the combination of amino acid and dipeptide compositions has been used as main attributes. In addition, annotations have been made using the criterion based on the identification of \u03b2-barrel membrane proteins and exclusion of globular and transmembrane helical proteins. A web interface has been developed for identifying the annotated \u03b2-barrel membrane proteins in all known genomes. The users have the feasibility of selecting the genome from the three kingdoms of life, archaea, bacteria and eukaryote, and five different methods. Further, the statistics for all genomes have been provided along with the links to different algorithms and related databases. It is freely available at .", "authors": ["M.
