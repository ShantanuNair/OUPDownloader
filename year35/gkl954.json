{"keywords": ["clone cells", "dna, complementary", "expressed sequence tags", "genes", "libraries", "suidae"], "abstract": "We formerly released the porcine expressed sequence tag (EST) database Pig EST Data Explorer (PEDE; ), which comprised 68\u2009076 high-quality ESTs obtained by using full-length-enriched cDNA libraries derived from seven tissues. We have added eight tissues and cell types to the EST analysis and have integrated 94\u2009555 additional high-quality ESTs into the database. We also fully sequenced the inserts of 10\u2009147 of the cDNA clones that had undergone EST analysis; the sequences and annotation of the cDNA clones were stored in the database. Further, we constructed an interface that can be used to perform various searches in the database. The PEDE database is the primary resource of expressed pig genes that are supported by full-length cDNA sequences. This resource not only enables us to pick cDNA clones of interest for a particular analysis, but it also confirms and thus contributes to the sequencing integrity of the pig genome, which is now being compiled by an international consortium (). PEDE has therefore evolved into what we now call \u2018Pig Expression Data Explorer\u2019.", "authors": ["Hirohide Uenishi", "Tomoko Eguchi-Ogawa", "Hiroki Shinkai", "Naohiko Okumura", "Kohei Suzuki", "Daisuke Toki", "Noriyuki Hamasima", "Takashi Awata"], "about": ["clone cells", "dna, complementary", "expressed sequence tags", "genes", "libraries", "suidae", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "PEDE (Pig EST Data Explorer) has been expanded into Pig Expression Data Explorer, including 10\u2009147 porcine full-length cDNA sequences\r\n "}
