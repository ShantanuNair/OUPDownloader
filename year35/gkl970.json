A database allowing researchers to investigate the genetic and structural variability of all available HCV sequences is an essential tool for studies on the molecular virology and pathogenesis of hepatitis C as well as drug design and vaccine development. We describe here the European Hepatitis C Virus Database (euHCVdb, ), a collection of computer-annotated sequences based on reference genomes. The annotations include genome mapping of sequences, use of recommended nomenclature, subtyping as well as three-dimensional (3D) molecular models of proteins. A WWW interface has been developed to facilitate database searches and the export of data for sequence and structure analyses. As part of an international collaborative effort with the US and Japanese databases, the European HCV Database (euHCVdb) is mainly dedicated to HCV protein sequences, 3D structures and functional analyses.", "authors": ["Christophe Combet", "Nicolas Garnier", "C\u00e9line Charavay", "Delphine Grando", "Daniel Crisan", "Julien Lopez", "Alexandre Dehne-Garcia", "Christophe Geourjon", "Emmanuel Bettler", "Chantal Hulo", "Philippe Le Mercier", "Ralf Bartenschlager", "Helmut Diepolder", "Darius Moradpour", "Jean-Michel Pawlotsky", "Charles M.
