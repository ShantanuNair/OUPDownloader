Over the past year WormBase has added new data on C.elegans, including data on classical genetics, cell biology and functional genomics; expanded the annotation of closely related nematodes with a new genome browser for Caenorhabditis remanei; and deployed new hardware for stronger performance. Several existing datasets including phenotype descriptions and RNAi experiments have seen a large increase in new content. New datasets such as the C.remanei draft assembly and annotations, the Vancouver Fosmid library and TEC-RED 5\u2032 end sites are now available as well. Access to and searching WormBase has become more dependable and flexible via multiple mirror sites and indexing through Google.", "authors": ["Tamberlyn Bieri", "Darin Blasiar", "Philip Ozersky", "Igor Antoshechkin", "Carol Bastiani", "Payan Canaran", "Juancarlos Chan", "Nansheng Chen", "Wen J.
