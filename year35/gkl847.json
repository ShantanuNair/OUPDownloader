It also includes all the sequence data for the extrachromosomal elements which can propagate in Sulfolobus organisms. All genomes and annotations deposited in GenBank are included in the database and a genefinder has been run on the sequences to ensure that all potential genes are present, and identifiable, in the database. Every month, all genes are searched against a range of external databases and new results are incorporated. The Sulfolobus database was developed as an asset to the rapidly-growing international community working with Sulfolobus as a model organism for the kingdom Crenarchaeota of the Archaea. It was accessed more that 46\u2009000 times in its first year. The database aims to provide researchers easy access to sequence and gene information and the web-interface includes various searches, free text and BLAST, as well as genome browsing and data extraction. Updated annotations are incorporated regularly and the database will continue to expand as new information becomes available. This includes new sequences, newly identified genes, annotations and other related information.", "authors": ["Kim Br\u00fcgger"], "about": ["archaea", "chromosomes", "crenarchaeota", "genes", "genome", "sulfolobus", "community", "genbank", "basic local alignment search tool", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The Sulfolobus database\r\n "}
