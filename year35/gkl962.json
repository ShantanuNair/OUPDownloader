The completion of the International HapMap Project makes it possible to identify loci that may cause human differentiation. We have devised an approach to find such ethnically variant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (ESNPs) from the genotype profile of the populations included in the International HapMap database. We selected ESNPs using the nearest shrunken centroid method (NSCM), and performed multiple tests for genetic heterogeneity and frequency spectrum on genes having ESNPs. The function and disease association of the selected SNPs were also annotated. This resulted in the identification of 100\u2009736 SNPs that appeared uniquely in each ethnic group. Of these SNPs, 1009 were within disease-associated genes, and 85 were predicted as damaging using the Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant system. This study resulted in the creation of the SNP@Ethnos database, which is designed to make this type of detailed genetic variation approach available to a wider range of researchers. SNP@Ethnos is a public database of ESNPs with annotation information that currently contains 100 736 ESNPs from 10\u2009138 genes, and can be accessed at  and  or directly at .", "authors": ["Jungsun Park", "Sohyun Hwang", "Yong Seok Lee", "Sang-Cheol Kim", "Doheon Lee"], "about": ["ethnic group", "genes", "genetic heterogeneity", "genotype", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "genetics", "international hapmap project", "disease association", "sorting", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "SNP@Ethnos: a database of ethnically variant single-nucleotide polymorphisms\r\n "}
