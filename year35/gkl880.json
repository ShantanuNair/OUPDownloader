The phylum Apicomplexa comprises numerous veterinary and medically important parasitic protozoa including human pathogenic species of the genera Cryptosporidium, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma. ApiDB serves not only as a database in its own right, but as a single web-based point of entry that unifies access to three major existing individual organism databases (,  and CryptoDB.org), and integrates these databases with data available from additional sources. Through the ApiDB site, users may pose queries and search all available apicomplexan data and tools, or they may visit individual component organism databases.", "authors": ["Cristina Aurrecoechea", "Mark Heiges", "Haiming Wang", "Zhiming Wang", "Steve Fischer", "Philippa Rhodes", "John Miller", "Eileen Kraemer", "Christian J.
