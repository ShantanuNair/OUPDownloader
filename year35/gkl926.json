There is increasing recognition that ncRNAs play important regulatory roles in multicellular organisms, and there is an expanding rate of discovery of novel ncRNAs as well as an increasing allocation of function. In this update to RNAdb, we provide nucleotide sequences and annotations for tens of thousands of non-housekeeping ncRNAs, including a wide range of mammalian microRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs and larger mRNA-like ncRNAs. Some of these have documented functions and/or expression patterns, but the majority remain of unclear significance, and include PIWI-interacting RNAs, ncRNAs identified from the latest rounds of large-scale cDNA sequencing projects, putative antisense transcripts, as well as ncRNAs predicted on the basis of structural features and alignments. Improvements to the database comprise not only new and updated ncRNA datasets, but also provision of microarray-based expression data and closer interface with more specialized ncRNA resources such as miRBase and snoRNA-LBME-db.
