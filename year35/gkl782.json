Most NATs are transcribed from opposite strands of their sense partners. They regulate sense genes at multiple levels and are implicated in various diseases. Using an improved whole-genome computational pipeline, we identified abundant cis-encoded exon-overlapping sense\u2013antisense (SA) gene pairs in human (7356), mouse (6806), fly (1554), and eight other eukaryotic species (total 6534). We developed NATsDB (Natural Antisense Transcripts DataBase, ) to enable efficient browsing, searching and downloading of this currently most comprehensive collection of SA genes, grouped into six classes based on their overlapping patterns. NATsDB also includes non-exon-overlapping bidirectional (NOB) genes and non-bidirectional (NBD) genes. To facilitate the study of functions, regulations and possible pathological implications, NATsDB includes extensive information about gene structures, poly(A) signals and tails, phastCons conservation, homologues in other species, repeat elements, expressed sequence tag (EST) expression profiles and OMIM disease association. NATsDB supports interactive graphical display of the alignment of all supporting EST and mRNA transcripts of the SA and NOB genes to the genomic loci. It supports advanced search by species, gene name, sequence accession number, chromosome location, coding potential, OMIM association and sequence similarity.", "authors": ["Yong Zhang", "Jiongtang Li", "Lei Kong", "Ge Gao", "Qing-Rong Liu", "Liping Wei"], "about": ["databases", "chromosomes", "exons", "expressed sequence tags", "genes", "genome", "rna, messenger", "mice", "mendelian inheritance in man, online", "graphical displays", "gene organization", "disease association", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "NATsDB: Natural Antisense Transcripts DataBase\r\n "}
