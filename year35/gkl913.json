{"keywords": ["base sequence", "xml", "patents", "genbank", "datasets", "bioinformatics"], "abstract": "The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database () at the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, UK, offers a large and freely accessible collection of nucleotide sequences and accompanying annotation. The database is maintained in collaboration with DDBJ and GenBank. Data are exchanged between the collaborating databases on a daily basis to achieve optimal synchrony. Webin is the preferred tool for individual submissions of nucleotide sequences, including Third Party Annotation, alignments and bulk data. Automated procedures are provided for submissions from large-scale sequencing projects and data from the European Patent Office. In 2006, the volume of data has continued to grow exponentially. Access to the data is provided via SRS, ftp and variety of other methods. Extensive external and internal cross-references enable users to search for related information across other databases and within the database. All available resources can be accessed via the EBI home page at . Changes over the past year include changes to the file format, further development of the EMBLCDS dataset and developments to the XML format.", "authors": ["Tamara Kulikova", "Ruth Akhtar", "Philippe Aldebert", "Nicola Althorpe", "Mikael Andersson", "Alastair Baldwin", "Kirsty Bates", "Sumit Bhattacharyya", "Lawrence Bower", "Paul Browne", "Matias Castro", "Guy Cochrane", "Karyn Duggan", "Ruth Eberhardt", "Nadeem Faruque", "Gemma Hoad", "Carola Kanz", "Charles Lee", "Rasko Leinonen", "Quan Lin", "Vincent Lombard", "Rodrigo Lopez", "Dariusz Lorenc", "Hamish McWilliam", "Gaurab Mukherjee", "Francesco Nardone", "Maria Pilar Garcia Pastor", "Sheila Plaister", "Siamak Sobhany", "Peter Stoehr", "Robert Vaughan", "Dan Wu", "Weimin Zhu", "Rolf Apweiler"], "about": ["base sequence", "xml", "patents", "genbank", "datasets", "bioinformatics", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database in 2006\r\n "}
