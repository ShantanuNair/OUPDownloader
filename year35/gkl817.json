{"keywords": ["functional genomics", "heterogeneity", "proton pump inhibitors", "maps", "datasets"], "abstract": "Systematic mapping of protein\u2013protein interactions has become a central task of functional genomics. To map the human interactome, several strategies have recently been pursued. The generated interaction datasets are valuable resources for scientists in biology and medicine. However, comparison reveals limited overlap between different interaction networks. This divergence obstructs usability, as researchers have to interrogate numerous heterogeneous datasets to identify potential interaction partners for proteins of interest. To facilitate direct access through a single entry gate, we have started to integrate currently available human protein interaction data in an easily accessible online database. It is called UniHI (Unified Human Interactome) and is available at . At present, it is based on 10 major interaction maps derived by computational and experimental methods. It includes more than 150\u2009000 distinct interactions between more than 17\u2009000 unique human proteins. UniHI provides researchers with a flexible integrated tool for finding and using comprehensive information about the human interactome.", "authors": ["Gautam Chaurasia", "Yasir Iqbal", "Christian H\u00e4nig", "Hanspeter Herzel", "Erich E.
