Currently, the database contains genotypes for 281\u2009439 common SNPs from 74 CHMs which were determined by a high-throughput array-based oligonucleotide hybridization technique. The database also presents maps of haplotype blocks and linkage disequilibrium bins together with tagSNPs that might prove useful for association studies of disease genes. Cryptic relatedness among the samples in this study is unlikely, because the formation of a CHM is a maternal event of rare sporadic occurrence, and its genotype is that of the incoming sperm. This is demonstrated by the absence of long extended shared haplotypes (ESHs). The D-HaploDB is freely accessible via the Internet at ", "authors": ["Koichiro Higasa", "Katsuyuki Miyatake", "Yoji Kukita", "Tomoko Tahira", "Kenshi Hayashi"], "about": ["genome", "genotype", "haplotypes", "internet", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "hydatidiform mole, complete", "genotype determination", "japanese", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "D-HaploDB: a database of definitive haplotypes determined by genotyping complete hydatidiform mole samples\r\n "}
