So far, many microarray studies have addressed aging-related expression patterns in multiple organisms and under different conditions. The number of relevant studies continues to increase rapidly. However, efficient exploitation of these vast data is frustrated by the lack of an integrated data mining platform or other unifying bioinformatic resource to enable convenient cross-laboratory searches of array signals. To facilitate the integrative analysis of microarray data on aging, we developed a web database and analysis platform \u2018Gene Aging Nexus\u2019 (GAN) that is freely accessible to the research community to query/analyze/visualize cross-platform and cross-species microarray data on aging. By providing the possibility of integrative microarray analysis, GAN should be useful in building the systems-biology understanding of aging. GAN is accessible at .", "authors": ["Fei Pan", "Chi-Hsien Chiu", "Sudip Pulapura", "Michael R. Mehan", "Juan Nunez-Iglesias", "Kangyu Zhang", "Kiran Kamath", "Michael S. Waterman", "Caleb E.
