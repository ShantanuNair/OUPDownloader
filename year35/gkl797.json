PolymiRTSs may affect gene expression and cause variations in complex phenotypes. The database integrates sequence polymorphism, phenotype and expression microarray data, and characterizes PolymiRTSs as potential candidates responsible for the quantitative trait locus (QTL) effects. It is a resource for studying PolymiRTSs and their implications in phenotypic variations. PolymiRTS database can be accessed at .", "authors": ["Lei Bao", "Mi Zhou", "Ligang Wu", "Lu Lu", "Dan Goldowitz", "Robert W.
