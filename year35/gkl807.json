{"keywords": ["genes", "mendelian inheritance in man, online", "patents", "entrez gene"], "abstract": "With the advent of automated and high-throughput techniques, the number of patent applications containing biological sequences has been increasing rapidly. However, they have attracted relatively little attention compared to other sequence resources. We have built a database server called Patome, which contains biological sequence data disclosed in patents and published applications, as well as their analysis information. The analysis is divided into two steps. The first is an annotation step in which the disclosed sequences were annotated with RefSeq database. The second is an association step where the sequences were linked to Entrez Gene, OMIM and GO databases, and their results were saved as a gene\u2013patent table. From the analysis, we found that 55% of human genes were associated with patenting. The gene\u2013patent table can be used to identify whether a particular gene or disease is related to patenting. Patome is available at ; the information is updated bimonthly.", "authors": ["Byungwook Lee", "Taehyung Kim", "Seon-Kyu Kim", "Kwang H.
