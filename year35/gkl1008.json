{"keywords": ["molecular biology", "nucleic acids"], "abstract": "The NAR online Molecular Biology Database Collection is a public resource that contains links to the databases described in this issue of Nucleic Acids Research, previous NAR database issues, as well as a selection of other molecular biology databases that are freely available on the web and might be useful to the molecular biologist. The 2007 update includes 968 databases, 110 more than the previous one. Many databases that have been described in earlier issues of NAR come with updated summaries, which reflect recent progress and, in some instances, an expanded scope of these databases. The complete database list and summaries are available online on the Nucleic Acids Research web site .", "authors": ["Michael Y.
