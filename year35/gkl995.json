{"keywords": ["functional genomics", "gene expression profiling", "genes", "community"], "abstract": "ArrayExpress is a public database for high throughput functional genomics data. ArrayExpress consists of two parts\u2014the ArrayExpress Repository, which is a MIAME supportive public archive of microarray data, and the ArrayExpress Data Warehouse, which is a database of gene expression profiles selected from the repository and consistently re-annotated. Archived experiments can be queried by experiment attributes, such as keywords, species, array platform, authors, journals or accession numbers. Gene expression profiles can be queried by gene names and properties, such as Gene Ontology terms and gene expression profiles can be visualized. ArrayExpress is a rapidly growing database, currently it contains data from >50\u2009000 hybridizations and >1\u2009500\u2009000 individual expression profiles. ArrayExpress supports community standards, including MIAME, MAGE-ML and more recently the proposal for a spreadsheet based data exchange format: MAGE-TAB. Availability: .", "authors": ["H.
