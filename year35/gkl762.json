We have developed a relational database, TassDB (TAndem Splice Site DataBase), which stores extensive data about alternative splice events at GYNGYN donors and NAGNAG acceptors. These splice events are of subtle nature since they mostly result in the insertion/deletion of a single amino acid or the substitution of one amino acid by two others. Currently, TassDB contains 114\u2009554 tandem splice sites of eight species, 5209 of which have EST/mRNA evidence for alternative splicing. In addition, human SNPs that affect NAGNAG acceptors are annotated. The database provides a user-friendly interface to search for specific genes or for genes containing tandem splice sites with specific features as well as the possibility to download large datasets. This database should facilitate further experimental studies and large-scale bioinformatics analyses of tandem splice sites. The database is available at .", "authors": ["Michael Hiller", "Swetlana Nikolajewa", "Klaus Huse", "Karol Szafranski", "Philip Rosenstiel", "Stefan Schuster", "Rolf Backofen", "Matthias Platzer"], "about": ["amino acids", "databases", "alternative splicing", "eukaryotic cells", "genes", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "proteome", "rna, messenger", "experimental study", "donors", "datasets", "bioinformatics", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "TassDB: a database of alternative tandem splice sites\r\n "}
