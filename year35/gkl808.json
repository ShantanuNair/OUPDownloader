It utilizes a variety of sequence data, including whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads and expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and achieves a successful mapping solution to the low-coverage genome problem. With the data presently available, we have identified a total of 15\u2009700 pig consensus sequences covering 18.5 Mb of the homologous human exons. We have also recovered 18\u2009700 SNPs and 20\u2009800 unique 60mer oligonucleotide probes for future pig genome analyses. PigGIS can be freely accessed via the web at  and .", "authors": ["Jue Ruan", "Yiran Guo", "Heng Li", "Yafeng Hu", "Fei Song", "Xin Huang", "Karsten Kristiensen", "Lars Bolund", "Jun Wang"], "about": ["consensus sequence", "exons", "expressed sequence tags", "genes", "genome", "internet", "oligonucleotide probes", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "suidae", "biomedical research", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "PigGIS: Pig Genomic Informatics System\r\n "}
