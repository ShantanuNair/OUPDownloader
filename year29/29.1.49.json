{"keywords": ["sequence analysis, protein"], "abstract": "MetaFam is a comprehensive relational database of protein family information. This web-accessible resource integrates data from several primary sequence and secondary protein family databases. By pooling together the information from these disparate sources, MetaFam is able to provide the most complete protein family sets available. Users are able to explore the interrelationships among these primary and secondary databases using a powerful graphical visualization tool, MetaFamView. Additionally, users can identify corresponding sequence entries among the sequence databases, obtain a quick summary of corresponding families (and their sequence members) among the family databases, and even attempt to classify their own unassigned sequences. Hypertext links to the appropriate source databases are provided at every level of navigation. Global family database statistics and information are also provided. Public access to the data is available at http://metafam.ahc.umn.edu/.", "authors": ["Kevin A. T. Silverstein", "Elizabeth Shoop", "James E. Johnson", "Alan Kilian", "John L. Freeman", "Timothy M.
