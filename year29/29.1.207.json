IMGT provides researchers and clinicians with a common access to all nucleotide, protein, genetic and structural immunogenetics data. This information is of high value for medical and veterinary research, biotechnology related to antibody and T cell receptor engineering, genome diversity and evolution studies of the immune response.", "authors": ["Marie-Paule Lefranc"], "about": ["immune response", "veterinary technician", "biotechnology", "engineering", "genome", "immunogenetics", "information systems", "major histocompatibility complex", "nucleotides", "t-cell receptor", "vertebrates", "immunoglobulins", "antibodies", "genetics", "molecule", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics database\r\n "}
