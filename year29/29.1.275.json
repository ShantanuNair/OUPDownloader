The database currently includes over 220 entries, which describe over 40 imprinted genes in human, mouse and other animals. In addition a wide variety of other parent-of-origin effects, such as transmission of human disease phenotypes, transmission of QTLs, uniparental disomies and interspecies crosses are recorded. Data are accessed through a search engine and references are hyperlinked to PubMed.", "authors": ["Ian M. Morison", "Croydon J. Paton", "Susan D.
