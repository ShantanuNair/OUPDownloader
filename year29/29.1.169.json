The SRP Database (SRPDB) provides compilations of SRP components, ordered alphabetically and phylogenetically. Alignments emphasize phylogenetically-supported base pairs in SRP RNA and conserved residues in the proteins. Data are provided in various formats including a column arrangement for improved access and simplified computational usability. Included are motifs for identification of new sequences, SRP RNA secondary structure diagrams, 3-D models and links to high-resolution structures. This release includes 11 new SRP RNA sequences (total of 129), two protein SRP9 sequences (total of seven), two protein SRP14 sequences (total of 10), two protein SRP19 sequences (total of 16), 10 new SRP54 (ffh) sequences (total of 66), two protein SRP68 sequences (total of seven) and two protein SRP72 sequences (total of nine). Seven sequences of the SRP receptor \u03b1-subunit and its FtsY homolog (total of 51) are new. Also considered are \u03b2-subunit of SRP receptor, Flhf, Hbsu, CaM kinase II and cpSRP43.
