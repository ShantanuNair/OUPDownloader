Consequently mistakes can seed the incorrect annotation of other sequences. Grouping genes into families and applying controlled annotation overcomes the problems of incorrect annotation associated with individual sequences. Two databases (http://www.mendel.ac.uk) were created to apply controlled annotation to plant genes and plant ESTs: Mendel-GFDb is a database of plant protein (gene) families based on gapped-BLAST analysis of all sequences in the SWISS-PROT family of databases. Sequences are aligned (ClustalW) and identical and similar residues shaded. The families are visually curated to ensure that one or more criteria, for example overall relatedness and/or domain similarity relate all sequences within a family. Sequence families are assigned a \u2018Gene Family Number\u2019 and a unified description is developed which best describes the family and its members. If authority exists the gene family is assigned a \u2018Gene Family Name\u2019. This information is placed in Mendel-GFDb. Mendel-ESTS is primarily a database of plant ESTs, which have been compared to Mendel-GFDb, completely sequenced genomes and domain databases. This approach associated ESTs with individual sequences and the controlled annotation of gene families and protein domains; the information being placed in Mendel-ESTS. The controlled annotation applied to genes and ESTs provides a basis from which a plant transcription database can be developed.", "authors": ["David Lonsdale", "Mark Crowe", "Benjamin Arnold", "Benedict C.
