The database deals with programmed ribosomal frameshifting, codon redefinition and translational bypass occurring in a variety of organisms. The entries for each event include the sequences of the corresponding genes, their encoded proteins for both the normal and alternate decoding, the types of the recoding events involved, trans-factors and cis-elements that influence recoding. The database is freely available at http://recode.genetics.utah.edu/.", "authors": ["Pavel V. Baranov", "Olga L. Gurvich", "Olivier Fayet", "Marie Fran\u00e7oise Pr\u00e8re", "W.
