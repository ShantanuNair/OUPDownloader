To this end, the results of systematic experiments should be compared with the rich source of individual experimental results accumulated so far. Thus, we constructed a database of the upstream regulatory information of B.subtilis (DBTBS). The current version was constructed by surveying 291 references and contains information on 90 binding factors and 403 promoters. For each promoter, all of its known cis-elements are listed according to their positions, while these cis-elements are aligned to illustrate their consensus sequence for each transcription factor. All probable transcription factors coded in the genome were classified with the Pfam motifs. Using this database, we compared the character of B.subtilis promoters with that of Escherichia coli promoters.
