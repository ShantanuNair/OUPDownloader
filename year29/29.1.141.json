In order to maximize the efficient use of the data and to minimize the redundant work for the research community, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) comprehensive BAC resource (cBACr) (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/BacResource/BAC_resource_intro.html) was built as an expansion of the TIGR human BAC ends database. This resource collects, integrates and reports the information on library, maps, sequence, annotation and functions for each human and mouse BAC. The current database contains 635 016 human BACs and 265 617 mouse BACs that were characterized by various approaches, among which 22 705 human clones and 1000 mouse clones have sequence and annotation data.", "authors": ["Shaying Zhao"], "about": ["bacterial artificial chromosomes", "clone cells", "genome", "genome, human", "libraries", "mice", "community", "maps", "myoc gene", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "A comprehensive BAC resource\r\n "}
