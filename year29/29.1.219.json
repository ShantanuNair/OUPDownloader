{"keywords": ["protein data bank"], "abstract": "PDB-REPRDB is a database of representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The previous version of PDB-REPRDB provided 48 representative sets, whose similarity criteria were predetermined, on the WWW. The current version is designed so that the user may obtain a quick selection of representative chains from PDB. The selection of representative chains can be dynamically configured according to the user\u2019s requirement. The WWW interface provides a large degree of freedom in setting parameters, such as cut-off scores of sequence and structural similarity. One can obtain a representative list and classification data of protein chains from the system. The current database includes 20 457 protein chains from PDB entries (August 6, 2000). The system for PDB-REPRDB is available at the Parallel Protein Information Analysis system (PAPIA) WWW server (http://www.rwcp.or.jp/papia/).", "authors": ["Tamotsu Noguchi", "Hideo Matsuda", "Yutaka Akiyama"], "about": ["protein data bank", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "PDB-REPRDB: a database of representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)\r\n "}
