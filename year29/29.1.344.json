The database is designed to provide the scientific community with a reference point for using gyrB as an evolutionary and taxonomic marker. Nucleic and amino acid sequence data are currently available for over 850 strains, along with alignments at several different taxonomic levels and an exhaustive review of primer selection and background information.", "authors": ["Kanako Watanabe", "James Nelson", "Shigeaki Harayama", "Hiroaki Kasai"], "about": ["amino acid sequence", "cell nucleus", "dna gyrase", "genes", "bacteria", "community", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "ICB database: the gyrB database for identification and classification of bacteria\r\n "}
