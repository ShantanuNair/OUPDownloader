{"keywords": ["cell growth", "base pairing", "genes", "nucleic acids", "open reading frames", "rna"], "abstract": "The non-coding RNAs database (http://biobases.ibch.poznan.pl/ncRNA/) contains currently available data on RNAs, which do not have long open reading frames and act as riboregulators. Non-coding RNAs are involved in the specific recognition of cellular nucleic acid targets through complementary base pairing to control cell growth and differentiation. Some of them are connected with several well known developmental and neuro\u00adbehavioral disorders. We have divided them into four groups. This paper is a short introduction to the database and presents its latest, updated edition.", "authors": ["Volker A. Erdmann", "Miroslawa Z.
