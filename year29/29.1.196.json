{"keywords": ["languages", "libraries", "software", "thermodynamics", "rna", "gene organization"], "abstract": "The database, called HyPaLib (for Hybrid Pattern Library), contains annotated structural elements characteristic for certain classes of structural and/or functional RNAs. These elements are described in a language specifically designed for this purpose. The language allows convenient specification of hybrid patterns, i.e. motifs consisting of sequence features and structural elements together with sequence similarity and thermodynamic constraints. We are currently developing software tools that allow a user to search sequence databases for any pattern in HyPaLib, thus providing functionality which is similar to PROSITE, but dedicated to the more complex patterns in RNA sequences. HyPaLib is available at http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/HyPa/.", "authors": ["Stefan Gr\u00e4f", "Dirk Strothmann", "Stefan Kurtz", "Gerhard Steger"], "about": ["languages", "libraries", "software", "thermodynamics", "rna", "gene organization", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "HyPaLib: a database of RNAs and RNA structural elements defined by hybrid patterns\r\n "}
