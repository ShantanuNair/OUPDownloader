It compiles more than 1600 entries of edited DNA sequence data from the 16S\u201323S ribosomal spacers present in most prokaryotes and organelles (e.g. mitochondria and chloroplasts) and is accessible through the Internet (http://ulises.umh.es/RISSC), where systematic searches for specific words can be conducted, as well as BLAST-type sequence searches. Additionally, a characteristic feature of this region, the presence/absence and nature of tRNA genes within the spacer, is included in all the entries, even when not previously indicated in the original database. All these combined features could provide a useful documen\u00adtation tool for studies on evolution, identification, typing and strain characterization, among others.", "authors": ["Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda-Mart\u00ednez", "Ignacio Besc\u00f3s", "Jes\u00fas Javier Rodr\u00edguez-Sala", "Francisco Rodr\u00edguez-Valera"], "about": ["mitochondria", "chloroplasts", "dna", "genes", "internet", "organelles", "prokaryotic cells", "ribosomes", "transfer rna", "rna", "spacer device", "basic local alignment search tool", "acronyms", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "RISSC: a novel database for ribosomal 16S\u201323S RNA genes spacer regions\r\n "}
