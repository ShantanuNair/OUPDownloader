{"keywords": ["actins", "databases", "internet", "yeasts", "growth"], "abstract": "The Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP; http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu) is a database that documents experimentally determined protein\u2013protein interactions. Since January 2000 the number of protein\u2013protein interactions in DIP has nearly tripled to 3472 and the number of proteins to 2659. New interactive tools have been developed to aid in the visualization, navigation and study of networks of protein interactions.", "authors": ["Ioannis Xenarios", "Esteban Fernandez", "Lukasz Salwinski", "Xiaoqun Joyce Duan", "Michael J.
