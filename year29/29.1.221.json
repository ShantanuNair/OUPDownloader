It includes images of the structure, annotated plots of each protein chain\u2019s secondary structure, detailed structural analyses generated by the PROMOTIF program, summary PROCHECK results and schematic diagrams of protein\u2013ligand and protein\u2013DNA interactions. RasMol scripts highlight key aspects of the structure, such as the protein\u2019s domains, PROSITE patterns and protein\u2013ligand interactions, for interactive viewing in 3D. Numerous links take the user to related sites. PDBsum is updated whenever any new structures are released by the PDB and is freely accessible via http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/pdbsum.", "authors": ["Roman A.
