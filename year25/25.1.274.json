{"keywords": ["cytochrome p450", "directories"], "abstract": "The Directory of P450-containing Systems on World-Wide Web has been designed to facilitate access to electronic resources for all researchers working in the field of P450-containing and related enzyme systems. Currently, it contains the most up-to-date list of sequences of both the P450 superfamily and proteins mediating electron transfer to P450, i.e. NADPH:P450 reductases, specific NAD(P)H:ferredoxin reductases, cytochrome b5 reductases, ferredoxins and cytochromes b5, and their homologues. All the referenced sequences are provided with accession numbers and links to major sequence databanks: PIR, SWISS-PROT, EMBL/GenBank and PRF. An associated database of steroid substrates and products of P450-dependent reactions has also been developed.", "authors": ["P\u00e9ter F\u00e1bi\u00e9n", "Kirill N.
