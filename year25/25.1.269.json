{"keywords": ["internet", "peptides", "sequence analysis", "affinity", "binding (molecular function)", "molecule"], "abstract": "MHCPEP is a curated database comprising over 9000 peptide sequences known to bind MHC molecules. Entries are compiled from published reports as well as from direct submissions of experimental data. Each entry contains the peptide sequence, its MHC specificity and, when available, experimental method, observed activity, binding affinity, source protein, anchor positions and publication references. The present format of the database allows text string matching searches but can easily be converted for use in conjunction with sequence analysis packages. The database can be accessed via Internet using WWW, FTP or Gopher.", "authors": ["Vladimir Brusic", "George Rudy", "Anthony P. Kyne", "Leonard C.
