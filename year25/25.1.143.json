These sequences define a homogeneous group of enzymes (carboxylesterases, lipases and hormone-sensitive lipases) sharing a similar structure of a central \u03b2-sheet surrounded by \u03b1-helices. Among these proteins a wide range of functions can be found (hydrolases, adhesion molecules, hormone precursors). The purpose of ESTHER is to help comparison of structures and functions of members of the family. Since the last release, new features have been added to the server. A BLAST comparison tool allows sequence homology searches within the database sequences. New sections are available: kinetics and inhibitors of cholinesterases, fasciculin-acetylcholinesterase interaction and a gene structure review. The mutation analysis compilation has been improved with three-dimensional images. A mailing list has been created.", "authors": ["Xavier Cousin", "Thierry Hotelier", "Kurt Giles", "Philippe Lievin", "Jean-Pierre Toutant", "Arnaud Chatonnet"], "about": ["cell adhesion molecules", "mutation analysis", "hormones", "butyrylcholinesterase", "carboxylic ester hydrolases", "cholinesterases", "esterase", "genes", "hydrolase", "sequence homology", "acetylcholinesterase", "enzymes", "kinetics", "lipase", "gene organization", "homogeneity", "prohormone", "basic local alignment search tool", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The \u03b1/\u03b2 fold family of proteins database and the cholinesterase gene server ESTHER\r\n "}
