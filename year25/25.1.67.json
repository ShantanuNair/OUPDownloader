The detailed information is distributed in specific lines arranged into an EMBL- (or SWISS-PROT-) like format. GIF-DB achieves a high level of integration with other databases such as FlyBase, EMBL and SWISS-PROT through numerous hyperlinks. The original concept of interaction databases examplified by GIF-DB could be extended to other biological subjects and organisms so as to study gene regulatory networks in an evolutionary perspective.", "authors": ["Bernard Jacq", "Florence Horn", "Florence Janody", "Nicolas Gompel", "Olivier Serralbo", "Elodie Mohr", "Christine Leroy", "Bernard Bellon", "Laurent Fasano", "Patrick Laurenti", "Laurence R\u00f6der"], "about": ["drosophila melanogaster", "embryo", "genes", "gene interaction", "binding (molecular function)", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "GIF-DB, a WWW database on gene interactions involved in Drosophila melanogaster development\r\n "}
