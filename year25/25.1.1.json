{"keywords": ["genome", "genbank", "basic local alignment search tool"], "abstract": "The GenBank sequence database incorporates DNA sequences from all available public sources, primarily through the direct submission of sequence data from authors and from large-scale sequencing projects. Data exchange with the EMBL Data Library and the DNA Data Bank of Japan helps ensure comprehensive coverage. GenBank continues to focus on quality control and annotation while expanding data coverage and retrieval services. An integrated retrieval system, known as Entrez, incorporates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases, along with genome maps and protein structure information. MEDLINE abstracts from published articles describing the sequences are also included as an additional source of biological annotation. Sequence similarity searching is offered through the BLAST family of programs. All of NCBI's services are offered through the World Wide Web. In addition, there are specialized server/client versions as well as FTP and e-mail server access.", "authors": ["Dennis A. Benson", "Mark S. Boguski", "David J.
