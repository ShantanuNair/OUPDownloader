MGD stores genetic, physical and comparative mapping data, clones/probes/PCR information, and phenotype descriptions for genes, mutations and mouse strains. Supporting software for importation, analysis, display and distribution of mouse genetic data have been developed. User support is provided through dedicated staff providing documentation, training, and response to individual user queries. MGD is accessible over the Internet at URL http://www.informatics.jax.org.", "authors": ["Judith A. Blake", "Joel E. Richardson", "Muriel T. Davisson", "Janan T.
