{"keywords": ["histones", "internet", "united states national institutes of health", "national library of medicine (u.s.)", "sequence alignment"], "abstract": "A database of aligned histone protein sequences has been constructed based on the results of homology searches of the major public sequence databases. In addition, sequences of proteins identified as containing the histone fold motif and structures of all known histone and histone fold proteins have been included in the current release. Database resources include information on conflicts between similar sequence entries in different source databases, multiple sequence alignments, and links to the Entrez integrated information retrieval system at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The database currently contains over 1000 protein sequences. All sequences and alignments in this database are available through the World Wide Web at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Baxevani/HISTONES/.", "authors": ["Andreas D.
