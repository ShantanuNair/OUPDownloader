SBASE was designed to facilitate the detection of functional homologies and can be searched with standard database-search programs. The present release contains over 79863 entries provided with standardized names and is cross-referenced to all major sequence databases and sequence pattern collections. The information is assigned to individual domains rather than to entire protein sequences, thus SBASE contains substantially more cross-references and links than do the protein sequence databases. The entries are clustered into >16 000 groups in order to facilitate the detection of distant similarities. SBASE 5.0 is freely available by anonymous \u2018ftp\u2019 file transfer from <ftp.icgeb.trieste.it >. Automated searching of SBASE with BLAST can be carried out with the WWW-server <http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/sbase/ >. and with the electronic mail server <sbase@icgeb.trieste.it > which now also provides a graphic representation of the homologies. A related WWW-server <http://www.abc.hu/blast.html > and e-mail server <domain@hubi.abc.hu > predicts SBASE domain homologies on the basis of SWISS-PROT searches.", "authors": ["P\u00e9ter F\u00e1bi\u00e1n", "J\u00e1nos Murvai", "Zsolt H\u00e1ts\u00e1gi", "Kristian Vlahovicek", "Hedvig Hegyi", "S\u00e1ndor Pongor"], "about": ["amino acid sequence", "libraries", "ligands", "tertiary protein structure", "electronic mail", "transfer technique", "basic local alignment search tool", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The SBASE protein domain library, release 5.0: a collection of annotated protein sequence segments\r\n "}
