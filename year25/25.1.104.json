The gRNA database is a comprehensive compilation of published guide RNA sequences from eight different kinetoplastid organisms. In addition to the RNA primary sequences, information on the gene localization, the experimental verification of the transcripts, and literature citations are provided. Accessory information includes the secondary structures of four Trypanosoma brucei gRNAs as well as a computer modelled three dimensional gRNA structure. The database is made available as a hypertext document accessible via the World Wide Web (WWW) or from the authors in a printed form.", "authors": ["Augustine E. Souza", "Thomas Hermann", "H.
