{"keywords": ["small nuclear rna"], "abstract": "The uRNADB offers aligned, annotated and phylo-genetically ordered sequences of several U RNAs. New to this release are RNAs from U7 (14 sequences), U8 (two sequences), U11 (three sequences), U12 (two sequences), U14 (11 sequences), U18, U48 and U49. A total of 34 new sequences were aligned with the previously compiled snRNAs U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U6.", "authors": ["Christian Zwie"], "about": ["small nuclear rna", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The uRNA database\r\n "}
