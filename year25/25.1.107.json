{"keywords": ["protein structure, secondary", "signal recognition particle", "software", "rna"], "abstract": "The SRPDB (Signal Recognition Particle Database) offers aligned SRP RNA and SRP protein sequences, phylogenetically ordered and annotated. This release adds three SRP RNA sequences (totaling 96 SRP RNA sequences) and 11 SRP protein sequences (a total of 39 protein sequences from SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP21, SRP54, SRP68 or SRP72). Also downloadable are sample SRP RNA secondary structure diagrams, a three-dimensional model of the human SRP RNA, search motifs and software.", "authors": ["Christian Zwieb", "Niels Larsen"], "about": ["protein structure, secondary", "signal recognition particle", "software", "rna", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB)\r\n "}
