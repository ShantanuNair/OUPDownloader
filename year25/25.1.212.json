Unlike regular expressions, fingerprints exploit groups of conserved motifs within sequence alignments to build characteristic signatures of family membership. Thus fingerprints inherently offer improved diagnostic reliability by virtue of the mutual context provided by motif neighbours. To date, 600 fingerprints have been constructed and stored in PRINTS, representing a 50% increase in the size of the database in the last year. The current version, 13.0, encodes \u223c3000 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides, and so on. The database is accessible via UCL's Bioinformatics World Wide Web (WWW) server at http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/. We describe here progress with the database, its Web interface, and a recent exciting development: the integration of a novel colour alignment editor (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/CINEMA), which allows visualisation and interactive manipulation of PRINTS alignments over the Internet.", "authors": ["T.
