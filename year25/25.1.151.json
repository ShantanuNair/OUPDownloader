{"keywords": ["mutation", "cancer", "cell lines", "tp53 gene", "neoplasms"], "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of p53 mutations identified in human cancers. The p53 mutation database consists of a list of point mutations in the p53 gene of human tumors and cell lines, compiled from the published literature and made available through electronic media. The database is now maintained at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and is updated twice a year. The current version contains records on 5091 published mutations and is expected to surpass the 6000 mark in the January 1997 release. The database is available in various formats through the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) ftp server at: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/p53/ or by request from IARC (p53database@iarc.fr) and will be searchable through the SRS system in the near future. This report provides a description of the criteria for inclusion of data and of the current formats, a summary of the relevance of p53 mutation analysis to clinical and biological questions, and a brief discussion of the prospects for future developments.", "authors": ["P.
