{"keywords": ["molecular biology", "genetics", "toxic shock syndrome", "maps", "bioinformatics"], "abstract": "Since July 1995, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) has maintained RHdb, a public database for radiation hybrid data. Radiation hybrid data are used in the generation of alternative genetic maps as they can include non-polymorphic markers and are also powerful enough to order unresolved genetic clusters of polymorphic STSs. The EBI is an Outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).", "authors": ["Patricia Rodriguez-Tom\u00e9", "Philip Lijnzaad"], "about": ["molecular biology", "genetics", "toxic shock syndrome", "maps", "bioinformatics", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The Radiation Hybrid Database\r\n "}
