Mutations in the LDLr gene (LDLR), which is located on chromosome 19, cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia associated with premature coronary atherosclerosis. To date almost 300 mutations have been identified in the LDLR gene. To facilitate the mutational analysis of the LDLR gene, and promote the analysis of the relationship between genotype and phenotype, a software package along with a computerized database (currently listing 210 entries) have been created.", "authors": ["Mathilde Varret", "Jean-Pierre Rab\u00e8s", "Gwena\u00eblle Collod-B\u00e9roud", "Claudine Junien", "Catherine Boileau", "Christophe B\u00e9roud"], "about": ["atherosclerosis", "phenotype", "coronary arteriosclerosis", "hypercholesterolemia", "computerized databases", "mutation", "familial hypercholesterolemia", "autosome disorder", "cholesterol", "mutation analysis", "homeostasis", "chromosomes, human, pair 19", "genes", "genotype", "low density lipoprotein receptor", "software", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Software and database for the analysis of mutations in the human LDL receptor gene\r\n "}
