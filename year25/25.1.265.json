{"keywords": ["binding sites", "dna", "genes", "regulatory sequences, nucleic acid", "transcription factor", "transcriptional control"], "abstract": "Three databases that provide data on transcriptional regulation are described. TRANSFAC is a database on transcription factors and their DNA binding sites. TRRD (Transcription Regulatory Region Database) collects information about complete regulatory regions, their regulation properties and architecture. COMPEL comprises specific information on composite regulatory elements. Here, we describe the present status of these databases and the first steps towards their federation.", "authors": ["E.
