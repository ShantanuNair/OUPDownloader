(1996) Nucleic Acids Res. 24, 1793\u20131798]. We report here an update of this catalogue which includes the addition of a new section devoted to human hepatitis delta virus (vHDV) sequences. This new section comprises all available vHDV sequences, irrespective of their completeness, which have been either published or were available from nucleic acid libraries. Additional structural characteristics of the vHDV genome, such as the positions of the self-catalytic domains, the antigen open reading frames, etc., are also included. The catalogue is available on the World Wide Web (http://www.callisto.si.usherb.ca/\u223cjpperra) in a user-friendly form. It should provide an excellent reference point for further molecular studies of these small circular pathogenic RNAs.", "authors": ["Daniel Lafontaine", "St\u00e9phane Mercure", "Jean-Pierre Perreault"], "about": ["antigens", "catalysis", "genome", "hepatitis delta virus", "internet", "libraries", "nucleic acids", "open reading frames", "viroids", "rna", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Update of the viroid and viroid-like sequence database: addition of a hepatitis delta virus RNA section\r\n "}
