Starting from the B.subtilis sequences available in the repository collections we have removed all encountered duplications, then we have added extra annotations to the sequences (e.g. accession numbers for the genes, locations on the genetic map, codon usage index). We have also added cross-references with EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ, MEDLINE, SWISS-PROT and ENZYME databases. NRSub is distributed through anonymous FTP as a text file in EMBL format and as an ACNUC database. It is also possible to access the database through two dedicated World Wide Web servers located in France (http://acnuc.univ-lyon1.fr/nrsub/nrsub.html) and in Japan (http://ddbjs4h.genes.nig.ac.jp/).", "authors": ["Guy Perri\u00e8re", "Ivan Moszer", "Takashi Gojobori"], "about": ["chromosome mapping", "bacillus subtilis", "codon nucleotides", "genes", "genome", "internet", "medline", "enzymes", "genetic linkage map", "genbank", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The NRSub database: update 1997\r\n "}
