{"keywords": ["databases", "genome", "sequence alignment", "community", "clients"], "abstract": "The Genome Sequence DataBase (GSDB) has completed its conversion to an improved relational database. The new database, GSDB 1.0, is fully operational and publicly available. Data contributions, including both original sequence submissions and community annotation, are being accomplished through the use of a graphical client-server interface tool, the GSDB Annotator, and via GIO (GSDB Input/Output) files. Data retrieval services are being provided through a new Web Query Tool and direct SQL. All methods of data contribution and data retrieval fully support the new data types that have been incorporated into GSDB, including discontiguous sequences, multiple sequence alignments, and community annotation.", "authors": ["Carol Harger", "Marian Skupski", "Ethan Allen", "Christopher Clark", "David Crowley", "Emily Dickinson", "David Easley", "Ada Espinosa-Lujan", "Andrew Farmer", "Chris Fields", "Leandrita Flores", "Lynn Harris", "Gifford Keen", "Maurice Manning", "Mia McLeod", "John O'Neill", "Maria Pumilia", "Rhonda Reinert", "David Rider", "John Rohrlich", "Yolanda Romero", "Jolene Schwertfeger", "Gustavo Seluja", "Adam Siepel", "Gautam Singh", "Linda Smyth", "David Stamper", "Judy Stein", "Randy Suggs", "Rajini Takkallapalli", "Nina Thayer", "Gary Thompson", "Colleen Walsh", "Frederick Wedgeworth, III", "Peter A.
