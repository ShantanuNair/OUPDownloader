Sum of the codon use of each organism has been also calculated. The data files can be obtained from anonymous ftp sites of DDBJ, DISC and EBI. The list of codon usage of genes in organisms was made searchable by name of organism through a web site. The compilation has been synchronized with a major release of GenBank.", "authors": ["Yasukazu Nakamura", "Takashi Gojobori", "Toshimichi Ikemura"], "about": ["base sequence", "codon nucleotides", "dna", "genes", "genetics", "genbank", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Codon usage tabulated from the international DNA sequence databases\r\n "}
