YPD is the first annotated database for the complete proteome of any organism. Now that the complete genome sequence of yeast is available, YPD contains entries for each of the characterized proteins and for each of the uncharacterized proteins predicted from the sequence. Contained in YPD are the calculated properties of each protein such as molecular weight and isoelectric point, experimentally determined properties such as subcellular localization and post-translational modifications, and extensive annotations from the yeast literature. YPD contains 25 000 lines of textual annotation that describe the known functions, mutant phenotypes, interactions, and other properties for the approximately 6000 proteins in the yeast proteome. The information in YPD is updated daily, and it is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.proteome.com/YPDhome.html.", "authors": ["William E. Payne", "James I.
