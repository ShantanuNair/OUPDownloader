The 1535 patient entries are ordered by the nucleotide number of their mutation. Where known, details are given on: factor IX activity, factor IX antigen in circulation, presence of inhibitor and origin of mutation. References to published mutations are given and the laboratories generating the data are indicated.", "authors": ["F. Giannelli", "P. M. Green", "S. S. Sommer", "M-C. Poon", "M. Ludwig", "R.
