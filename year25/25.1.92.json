This database prevalently contains information related to human oligonucleotides used in diagnostics. Molecular Probe Data Base has been made available on-line through the Internet by means of Network Information Retrieval (NIR) tools since 1993. Two years ago, a collaboration with EMBL Data Library was also set up, so that the Molecular Probe Data Base has been integrated with other molecular biology data banks in the sphere of the SRS WWW network browser. In this paper, the most recent enhancements and the current status of the Molecular Probe Data Base are briefly presented.", "authors": ["Maria Giuseppina Campi", "Mirco Castoldi", "Paolo Romano", "Eduardo Th\u00fcroff", "Maria Assunta Manniello", "Beatrice Iannotta", "Gabriella Rondanina", "Tiziana Ruzzon", "Leonardo Santi"], "about": ["databases", "information storage and retrieval", "internet", "libraries", "molecular biology", "molecular probes", "nucleotides", "oligonucleotides", "diagnosis", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Molecular Probe Data Base (MPDB)\r\n "}
