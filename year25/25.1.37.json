This extraction has been made publicly available in the hope that others will find it useful for a variety of purposes. The original release in October 1995 contained 1814 distinct pathways. The current collection contains 2180. Metabolic reconstructions for the first completely sequenced organisms\u2014Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Methanococcus janaschii\u2014are all included in the current release. All of the pathways in the collections are available as ASCII files in the form generated by the main curator, Evgeni Selkov. In addition, we are offering a more structured encoding of a subset of the collection; our initial release of this subcollection includes all of the pathways in Mycoplasma genitalium, and we ultimately intend to offer the entire collection in this form as well.", "authors": ["Evgeni Selkov", "Miliusha Galimova", "Igor Goryanin", "Yuri Gretchkin", "Natalia Ivanova", "Yuri Komarov", "Natalia Maltsev", "Natalia Mikhailova", "Valeri Nenashev", "Ross Overbeek", "Elena Panyushkina", "Lyudmila Pronevitch", "Evgeni Selkov, Jr"], "about": ["haemophilus influenzae", "methanococcus", "reconstructive surgical procedures", "saccharomyces cerevisiae", "enzymes", "mycoplasma genitalium", "earth microbiome project", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "The metabolic pathway collection: an update\r\n "}
