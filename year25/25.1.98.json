Currently, about 600 small RNA sequences are in our database. It also gives the sources of individual RNAs and their GenBank accession numbers. The small RNA database can be accessed through WWW(World Wide Web). Our WWW URL address is: http://mbcr.bcm.tmc.edu/smallRNA/smallrna.html. The new small RNA sequences published since our last compilation are listed in this paper.", "authors": ["Jian Gu", "Ram Reddy"], "about": ["mitochondria", "cytoplasm", "internet", "prokaryotic cells", "viruses", "rna", "rna, small", "genbank", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Small RNA database\r\n "}
