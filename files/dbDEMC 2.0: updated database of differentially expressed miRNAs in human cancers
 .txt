MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are often deregulated in cancer and are thought to play an important role in cancer development. Large amount of differentially expressed miRNAs have been identified in various cancers by using high-throughput methods. It is therefore quite important to make a comprehensive collection of these miRNAs and to decipher their roles in oncogenesis and tumor progression. In 2010, we presented the first release of dbDEMC, representing a database for collection of differentially expressed miRNAs in human cancers obtained from microarray data. Here we describe an update of the database. dbDEMC 2.0 documents 209 expression profiling data sets across 36 cancer types and 73 subtypes, and a total of 2224 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. An easy-to-use web interface was constructed that allows users to make a quick search of the differentially expressed miRNAs in certain cancer types. In addition, a new function of ‘meta-profiling’ was added to view differential expression events according to user-defined miRNAs and cancer types. We expect this database to continue to serve as a valuable source for cancer investigation and potential clinical application related to miRNAs. dbDEMC 2.0 is freely available at http://www.picb.ac.cn/dbDEMC.
