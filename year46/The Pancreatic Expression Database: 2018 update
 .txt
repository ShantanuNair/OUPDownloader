The Pancreatic Expression Database (PED, http://www.pancreasexpression.org) continues to be a major resource for mining pancreatic â€“omics data a decade after its initial release. Here, we present recent updates to PED and describe its evolution into a comprehensive resource for extracting, analysing and integrating publicly available multi-omics datasets. A new analytical module has been implemented to run in parallel with the existing literature mining functions. This analytical module has been created using rich data content derived from pancreas-related specimens available through the major data repositories (GEO, ArrayExpress) and international initiatives (TCGA, GENIE, CCLE). Researchers have access to a host of functions to tailor analyses to meet their needs. Results are presented using interactive graphics that allow the molecular data to be visualized in a user-friendly manner. Furthermore, researchers are provided with the means to superimpose layers of molecular information to gain greater insight into alterations and the relationships between them. The literature-mining module has been improved with a redesigned web appearance, restructured query platforms and updated annotations. These updates to PED are in preparation for its integration with the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund Tissue Bank (PCRFTB), a vital resource of pancreas cancer tissue for researchers to support and promote cutting-edge research.
