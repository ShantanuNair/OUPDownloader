 The small RNA database is a compilation of all the small size RNA sequences available to date from prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. About 500 small RNA sequences are in our database currently. The sources of individual RNAs and their GenBank accession numbers are also included. The small RNA database can be accessed through the World Wide Web (WWW). Our WWW URL is http://mbcr.bcm.tmc.edu/smallRNA/smallrna.html . The new small RNA sequences published since our last compilation are listed in this paper. 
 We have created databases and software applications for the analysis of DNA mutations in the human p53 gene, the human hprt gene and the rodent transgenic lacZ locus. The databases themselves are stand-alone dBase files and the software for analysis of the databases runs on IBM-compatible computers. The software created for these databases permits filtering, ordering, report generation and display of information in the database. In addition, a significant number of routines have been developed for the analysis of single base substitutions. One method of obtaining the databases and software is via the World Wide Web (WWW). Open home page http://sunsite.unc.edu/dnam/mainpage.html with a WWW browser. Alternatively, the databases and programs are available via public ftp from anonymous@sunsite.unc.edu . There is no password required to enter the system. The databases and software are found in subdirectory pub/academic/biology/dna-mutations . Two other programs are available at the WWW site, a program for comparison of mutational spectra and a program for entry of mutational data into a relational database. 
 The encyclopedia of Escherichia coli genes and metabolism (EcoCyc) is a database that combines information about the genome and the intermediary metabolism of E.coli . It describes 2034 genes, 306 enzymes encoded by these genes, 580 metabolic reactions that occur in E.coli and the organization of these reactions into 100 metabolic pathways. The EcoCyc graphical user interface allows query and exploration of the EcoCyc database using visualization tools such as genomic map browsers and automatic layouts of metabolic pathways. EcoCyc spans the space from sequence to function to allow investigation of an unusually broad range of questions. EcoCyc can be thought of as both an electronic review article, because of its copious references to the primary literature, and as an in silico model of E.coli that can be probed and analyzed through computational means. 
The sixth edition of the haemophilia B database lists in easily accessible form all known factor IX mutations due to small changes (base substitutions and short additions and/or deletions of <30 bp) identified in haemophilia B patients. The 1380 patient entries are ordered by the nucleotide number of their mutation. Where known, details are given on factor IX activity, factor IX antigen in circulation and origin of mutation. References to published mutations are given and the laboratories generating the data are indicated.
The Antwerp database on small ribosomal subunit RNA offers over 4300 nucleotide sequences (August 1995). All these sequences are stored in the form of an alignment based on the adopted secondary structure model, which in turn is corroborated by the observation of compensating substitutions in the alignment. Besides the primary and secondary structure information, literature references, accession numbers and detailed taxonomic information are also compiled. The complete database is made available to the scientific community through anonymous ftp and World Wide Web (WWW).
 The FSSP database presents a continuously updated classification of 3-D protein folds based on an all-against-all comparison of structures currently in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [Bernstein et al. (1977) J. Mol. Biol. , 112, 535–542]. The database currently contains an extended structural family for each of 600 representative protein chains which have <25% mutual sequence identity. The results of the exhaustive pairwise structure comparisons are reported in the form of a fold tree generated by hierachical clustering and as a series of structurally representative sets of folds at varying levels of uniqueness. For each query structure from the representative set, there is a database entry containing structure-structure alignments with its structural neighbours in the representative set and its sequence homologs in the PDB. All alignments are based purely on the 3-D co-ordinates of the proteins and are derived by an automatic structure comparison program (Dali). The FSSP database is accessible electronically on the World Wide Web and by anonymous ftp. 
 The Blocks Database contains multiple alignments of conserved regions in protein families. The database can be searched by e-mail and World Wide Web (WWW) servers ( http://blocks.fhcrc.org/help ) to classify protein and nucleotide sequences. 
 FlyBase is a database of genetic and molecular data concerning Drosophila . FlyBase is maintained as a relational database (in Sybase). The scope of FlyBase includes: genes, alleles (and phenotypes), aberrations, pointers to sequence data, clones, stock lists, Drosophila workers and bibliographic references. FlyBase is also available on CD-ROM for Macintosh systems ( Encyclopaedia of Drosophila ). 
 SBASE 4.0 is the fourth release of SBASE, a collection of annotated protein domain sequences that represent various structural, functional, ligand binding and topogenic segments of proteins. SBASE was designed to facilitate the detection of functional homologies and can be searched with standard database search tools, such as FASTA and BLAST3. The present release contains 61 137 entries provided with standardized names and cross-referenced to all major protein, nucleic acid and sequence pattern collections. The entries are clustered into 13 155 groups in order to facilitate detection of distant similarities. SBASE 4.0 is freely available by anonymous ftp file transfer from ftp.icgeb.trieste.it . Individual records can be retrieved with the gopher server at http:icgeb.trieste.it and with a World Wide Web server at http://www.icgeb.trieste.it . Automated searching of SBASE with BLAST can be carried out with the electronic mail server sbase@ic-geb.trieste.it , which now also provides a graphic representation of the homologies. A related mail server, domain@hubi.abc.hu , assigns SBASE domain homologies on the basis of SWISS-PROT searches. 
 SWISS-2DPAGE is a database of proteins identified on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). The current release contains 343 entries of human, yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) and Escherichia coli origin , as well as virtual entries for each of the protein sequences in the SWISS-PROT database. 
The genome sequence database (GSDB) is a complete, publicly available relational database of DNA sequences and annotation maintained by the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) under a Cooperative Agreement with the US Department of Energy (DOE). GSDB provides direct, client-server access to the database for data contributions, community annotation and SQL queries. The GSDB Annotator, a multi-platform graphic user interface, is freely available. Automatically updated relational replicates of GSDB are also freely available.
 The glucocorticoid receptor resource focuses on the structure-function relationships of the glucocorticoid receptor. As well as links to sequence and bibliographic databases via the World Wide Web, the database contains sequence comparisons of receptors from different species and source information for glucocorticoid receptor clones, probes, cell lines and antibodies. The resource allows the electronic publication of essays, unpublished data and reviews on steroid receptors. These publications will not be reviewed or edited and should allow the rapid dissemination of information to the scientific community. The resource can be reached at: http://biochem1.basic-sci.georgetown.edu/grr/grr.html.
 We have compiled the DNA sequence data for Escherichia coli available from the GenBank and EMBL data libraries and independently from the literature. Unlike the previous updates of our E.coli databases, we provide the most recent version preferentially via the World Wide Web System (use URL: http://susi.bio.unigiessen.de/usr/local/www/html/ecdc.html ). Our database includes an assembled set of contiguous sequences. Each of these contigs compiles all available sequence information, including those derived from a variety of elder sequences. The organisation of the database allows one to find the exact physical location of each individual gene or regulatory region, even regarding discrepancies in nomenclature. The WWW program allows access into the original EMBL and SWISSPROT datafiles. A FASTA and BLAST search may be performed online. Besides the WWW format a flat file version may be obtained via ftp. The complete compilation, including a full set of genetic map data and the E.coli protein index, can be obtained in machine readable form from the EMBL data library as a part of the CD-ROM issue of the EMBL sequence database, released and updated every three months. After deletion of all detected overlaps a total of 3 333 878 individual bp was determined by the end of September 1995. This corresponds to a total of 71.71% of the entire E.coli chromosome consisting of about 4720 kbp. About 94 kbp (2%) are available additionally, but have not yet been definitely mapped. 
The molecular probe data base (MPDB) contains detailed information on synthetic oligonucleotides, including their identification, target genes, applications and bibliographic references. It is available on-line through lnternet and can be searched by using Network Information Retrieval tools. In this article the most recent enhancements of MPDB, both in terms of data contents and new ways of access, are described. These include a recently established collaboration with EMBL Data Library, in the sphere of SRSWWW network browser, in view of a better integration of MPDB with other molecular biology databases.
The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB) provides aligned SRP RNA and SRP protein sequences, annotated and phylogenetically ordered. The current release includes 93 RNAs and 29 proteins representing SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP21, SRP54, SRP68 and SRP72. The SRPDB can be downloaded and is accessible via the World Wide Web.
The TransTerm database of sequence contexts of stop and start codons has been expanded to include ∼ 50% more species than last year's release. It now contains 148 organisms and >39 500 coding sequences; it is now available on the World Wide Web. The database includes: (i) initiation and termination sequence contexts organized by species; (ii) summary parameters about the individual sequences (sequence length, GC%, GC3, Nc, CAI) in addition to tables of base frequencies for each species' stop and start codon sequence context; (iii) species codon usage tables; and (iv) summary tables of stop signal frequency.
 Ribonuclease P is the endoribonuclease responsible for the removal of leader sequences from tRNA precursors. Ribonuclease P is a ribonucleoprotein, and in bacteria the RNA alone is capable of pre-tRNA processing in vitro , i.e. it is a catalytic RNA. The Ribonuclease P Database is a compilation of ribo-nuclease P sequences, sequence alignments, secondary structures, three-dimensional models and accessory information, in the form of a hypertext document available via the Worldwide Web. 
The SV40 T antigen database is a listing of plasmids and/or viruses that express mutant forms of the virus-encoded large T antigen protein. The parental virus strain, nucleic acid sequence of the mutations, the effect of the mutation on the T antigen amino acid sequence, and key references are included in the listing. The database is available from the authors as a Macintosh FileMaker Pro file, or as a hard copy printout.
This electronic database is a collection of 225 sets of data on mutations in more than twenty-three thousand mutants (October, 1995) in eleven bacterial genes, five mammalian genes and one gene in yeast cells. Each dataset consists of the changes in DNA sequence in the mutants, typically tens to hundreds, induced by mutagenesis of a particular cell line under specific conditions. The database is available on the Internet and on diskettes, and is periodically updated. Researchers are invited to submit additional data. A data entry program, MUTSIN, is available that diagrams each mutation on the computer screen as entered and alerts the user to any inconsistency between the entry and the wild type gene sequence.
 We have built a database of sequences phylogeneti-cally related to cholinesterases ( EST HER for esterases, α/β h ydrolase e nzymes and r elatives). These sequences define a homogeneous group of enzymes (carboxylesterases, lipases and hormone-sensitive lipases) with some related proteins devoid of enzymatic activity. The purpose of ESTHER is to help comparison and alignment of any new sequence appearing in the field, to favour mutation analysis of structure-function relationships and to allow structural data recovery. ESTHER is a World Wide Web server with the URL http://www.montpellier.inra.fr:70/cholinesterase . 
 The ENZYME data bank is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes. The current version (October 1995) contains information relevant to 3594 enzymes. It is available from a variety of file and ftp servers as well as through the ExPASy World Wide Web server ( http://expasy.hcuge.ch/ ). 
 The 23S Ribosomal RNA Mutation Database (23SMDB), provides a list of mutated positions in 23S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli and the identity of each alteration. Information provided for each mutation includes: (i) a brief description of the phenotype(s) associated with each mutation, (ii) whether a mutant phenotype has been detected by in vivo or in vitro methods, and (iii) relevant literature citations. The database is available via ftp and on the World Wide Web. 
HSSP is a derived database merging structural three dimensional (3-D) and sequence one dimensional (1-D) information. For each protein of known 3-D structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the database has a multiple sequence alignment of all available homologues and a sequence profile characteristic of the family. The list of homologues is the result of a database search in Swissprot using a position-weighted dynamic programming method for sequence profile alignment (MaxHom). The database is updated frequently. The listed homologues are very likely to have the same 3-D structure as the PDB protein to which they have been aligned. As a result, the database is not only a database of aligned sequence families, but also a database of implied secondary and tertiary structures covering 27% of all Swissprot-stored sequences.
Codon usage in 87 602 genes has been calculated using the nucleotide sequence data obtained from the GenBank Genetic Sequence Data Bank (Release 90.0; September 1995). The database is called the CUTG Database; the complete form of the database can be obtained by anonymous ftp from DDBJ and a part of the database, which lists the frequency of codon use in each organism, is made searchable through our World Wide Web server.
Version 6.0 of the Human Genome Data Base introduces a number of significant improvements over previous releases of GDB. The most important of these are revised data representations for genes and genomic maps and a new curatorial model for the database. GDB 6.0 is the first major genomic database to provide read/write access directly to the scientific community, including capabilities for third-party annotation. The revised database can represent all major categories of genetic and physical maps, along with the underlying order and distance information used to construct them. The improved representation permits more sophisticated map queries to be posed and supports the graphical display of maps. In addition, the new GDB has a richer model for gene information, better suited for supporting cross-references to databases describing gene function, structure, products, expression and associated phenotypes.
 In the context of the international project aimed at sequencing the whole genome of Bacillus subtilis we have developed a non-redundant, fully annotated database of sequences from this organism. Starting from the B.subtilis sequences available in the EMBL, GenBank and DDBJ collections we have removed all encountered duplications and then added extra annotations to the sequences (e.g. accession numbers for the genes, locations on the genetic map, codon usage, etc.) We have also added cross-references to the EMBL, MEDLINE, SWISS-PROT and ENZYME data banks. The present system results from merging of the NRSub and SubtiList databases and the sequence contigs used in the two systems are identical. NRSub is distributed as a flatfile in EMBL format (which is supported by most sequence analysis software packages) and as an ACNUC database, while SubtiList is distributed as a relational database under 4th Dimension. It is possible to access the data through two dedicated World Wide Web servers located in France and Japan. 
 The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) is a curated database that offers ribosome-related data, analysis services and associated computer programs. The offerings include phylogenetically ordered alignments of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences, derived phylogenetic trees, rRNA secondary structure diagrams and various software for handling, analyzing and displaying alignments and trees. The data are available via anonymous ftp ( http://rdp.life.uiuc.edu ), electronic mail ( server@rdp.life.uiuc.edu ), gopher ( rdpgopher.life.uiuc.edu rdpgopher.life. uiuc.edu) and World Wide Web (WWW) ( http://rdpwww.life.uiuc.edu/ ). The electronic mail and WWW servers provide ribosomal probe checking, screening for possible chimeric rRNA sequences, automated alignment and approximate phylogenetic placement of user-submitted sequences on an existing phylogenetic tree. 
The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) maintains and distributes the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence database, Europe's primary nucleotide sequence data resource. The EBI also maintains and distributes the SWISS-PROT Protein Sequence database, in collaboration with Amos Bairoch of the University of Geneva. Over fifty additional specialist molecular biology databases, as well as software and documentation of interest to molecular biologists are available. The EBI network services include database searching and sequence similarity searching facilities.
TRANSFAC is a database about eukaryotic transcription regulating DNA sequence elements and the transcription factors binding to and acting through them. This report summarizes the present status of this database and accompanying retrieval tools.
 The 16S ribosomal RNA mutation database (16SMDB) provides a list of mutated positions in 16S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli and the identity of each alteration. Information provided for each mutation includes: (i) a brief description of the phenotype(s) associated with each mutation; (ii) whether a mutant phenotype has been detected by in vivo or in vitro methods; (iii) relevant literature citations. The database is available via ftp and on the World Wide Web. 
The PROSITE database consists of biologically significant patterns and profiles formulated in such a way that with appropriate computational tools it can help to determine to which known family of proteins (if any) a new sequence belongs or which known domain(s) it contains.
 The PAH Mutation Analysis Consortium (81 investigators, 26 countries) is engaged in mutation detection at the human PAH locus. Ascertainment of probands occurs largely through newborn screening for hyperphenylalaninemia. A relational database records allelic variation (disease-producing and polymorphic) at the locus. Information is distributed by Newsletter, diskette (WINPAHDB software stand-alone executable on IBM compatible hardware), and at a ‘real’ site on the Worldwide Web ( http://www.mcgill.ca/pahdb ). The database presently records (Sept. 27, 1995) 248 alleles in 798 different associations (with polymorphic haplotype, geographic region and population) along with additional information. The database, as a record of human genetic diversity, at a particular locus, contributes to the study of human evolution and demic expansion; it also has medical relevance. 
The RNA modification database provides a comprehensive listing of post-transcriptionally modified nucleosides from RNA and is maintained as an updated version of the initial printed report. Information provided includes: type(s) of RNA in which found and phylogenetic distribution; common chemical names and symbols; Chemical Abstracts registry numbers and index names; chemical structures; initial literature citations for structural characterization or occurrence and chemical synthesis. The data are available through the World Wide Web, anonymous ftp or from the authors in printed form.
The uRNADB provides aligned, annotated and phy-logenetically ordered sequences of the uRNAs. At the time of manuscript submission (August 1995) it contained sequences for U1 (78 sequences), U2 (80), U3 (20), U4 (38), U5 (37) and U6 (46). Additional uRNAs of interest will be available by the time you read this.
SWISS-PROT is a curated protein sequence database which strives to provide a high level of annotation (such as the description of the function of a protein, its domain structure, post-translational modifications, variants, etc), a minimal level of redundancy and a high level of integration with other databases. Recent developments of the database include: an increase in the number and scope of model organisms; cross-references to seven additional databases; a variety of new documentation files; the creation of TREMBL, an unannotated supplement to SWISS-PROT. This supplement consists of entries in SWISS-PROT-like format derived from the translation of all coding sequences (CDS) in the EMBL nucleotide sequence database, except CDS already included in SWISS-PROT.
 REBASE is a comprehensive database of information about restriction enzymes and their associated methy-lases, including their recognition and cleavage sites and their commercial availability. Information from REBASE is available via monthly electronic mailings as well as via WAIS, anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web ( http://www.neb.com/rebase ). Specialized files are available that can be used directly by many software packages. 
 The Gene Regulation Database (GRBase) is a compendium of information on the structure and function of proteins involved in the control of gene expression in eukaryotes. These proteins include transcription factors, proteins involved in signal transduction, and receptors. GRBase is now accessible via the World Wide Web ( http://www.access.digex.net/∼regulate ). A key feature of this database is the linking of each entry to data in other databases. The database is also available by anonymous ftp (URL http://ftp.trevigen.com/pub/Tfactors/ ) in both text and Filemaker pro formats. 
A large number of different mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 gene have been identified in all types of cancer. As of September 1995, this database contains over 4200 mutations. This substantial increase since our previous report can enable epidemiological analyses which were not previously possible. In order to capture all these new data, the software permitting analysis has been improved. This report describes the various improvements since first release of the database.
 The current version of the androgen receptor (AR) gene mutations database is described. We have added (if available) data on the androgen binding phenotype of the mutant AR, the clinical phenotype of the affected persons, the family history and whether the pathogenicity of a mutation has been proven. Exonic mutations are now listed in 5′→3′sequence regardless of type and single base pair changes are presented in codon context. Splice site and intronic mutations are listed separately. The database has allowed us to substantiate and amplify the observation of mutational hot spots within exons encoding the AR androgen binding domain. The database is available from EMBL ( ftp://www.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/androgen ) or as a Macintosh Filemaker file ( MC33@musica.mcgill.ca ) 
From its origin the Protein Sequence Database has been designed to support research and has focused on comprehensive coverage, quality control and organization of the data in accordance with biological principles. Since 1988 the database has been maintained collaboratively within the framework of PIR-International, an association of macromolecular sequence data collection centers dedicated to fostering international cooperation as an essential element in the development of scientific databases. The database is widely distributed and is available on the World Wide Web, via ftp, email server, on CD-ROM and magnetic media. It is widely redistributed and incorporated into many other protein sequence data compilations, including SWISS-PROT and the Entrez system of the NCBI.
 GenProtEc is a database of Escherichia coli genes and their gene products, classified by type of function and physiological role and with citations to the literature for each. Also present are data on sequence similarities among E.coli proteins with PAM values, percent identity of amino acids, length of alignment and percent aligned. The database is available as a PKZip file by ftp from mbl.edu/pub/ecoli.exe . The program runs under MS-DOS on IBM-compatible machines. GenProtEc can also be accessed through the World Wide Web at URL http://mbl.edu/html/ecoli.html . 
MHCPEP is a curated database comprising over 6000 peptide sequences known to bind MHC molecules. Entries are compiled from published reports as well as from direct submissions of experimental data. Each entry contains peptide sequence, MHC specificity and when available, experimental method, observed activity, binding affinity, source protein, anchor positions, as well as publication references. The present format of the database allows text string matching searches but can easily be converted for use in conjunction with sequence analysis packages. The database can be accessed via Internet using Gopher, FTP or WWW
Fibrillin is the major component of extracellular microfibrils. Mutations in the fibrillin gene on chromosome 15 (FBN1) were described at first in the heritable connective tissue disorder, Marfan syndrome (MFS). More recently, FBN1 has also been shown to harbor mutations related to a spectrum of conditions phe-notypically related to MFS and many mutations will have to be accumulated before genotype/phenotype relationships emerge. To facilitate mutational analysis of the FBN1 gene, a software package along with a computerized database (currently listing 63 entries) have been created.
X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is an immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the gene coding for Bruton's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (BTK). A database (BTKbase) of BTK mutations has been compiled and the recent update lists 225 entries from 189 unrelated families showing 148 unique molecular events. Each patient is given a unique patient identity number (PIN). Information is included regarding the phenotype including symptoms. Mutations in all the five domains of BTK have been noticed to cause the disease, the most common event being missense mutations. The mutations appear almost uniformly throughout the molecule and frequently affect CpG sites forming arginine residues. A decreased frequency of missense mutations was found in the TH, SH3 and upper lobe of the kinase domain. The putative structural implications of all the missense mutations are given in the database.
A database is described in which over 700 mutations in the human APC gene of tumors (colon cancer predominantly) are compiled from the literature. It includes both molecular informations about the mutations and also clinical data about the patients. A software have been designed in order to analyse all these informations in the database.
The Enzymes and Metabolic Pathways database (EMP) is an encoding of the contents of over 10 000 original publications on the topics of enzymology and metabolism. This large body of information has been transformed into a queryable database. An extraction of over 1800 pictorial representations of metabolic pathways from this collection is freely available on the World Wide Web. We believe that this collection will play an important role in the interpretation of genetic sequence data, as well as offering a meaningful framework for the integration of many other forms of biological data.
 By searching the current protein sequence databases using sequences from human and chicken histones H1/H5, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, a database of aligned histone protein sequences with statistically significant sequence similarity to the search sequences was constructed. In addition, a nucleotide sequence database of the corresponding coding regions for these proteins has been assembled. The region of each of the core histones containing the histone fold motif is identified in the protein alignments. The database contains >1300 protein and nucleotide sequences. All sequences and alignments in this database are available through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Baxevani/HISTONES . 
Our database on large ribosomal subunit RNA contained 334 sequences in July, 1995. All sequences in the database are aligned, taking into account secondary structure. The aligned sequences are provided, together with incorporated secondary structure information, in several computer-readable formats. These data can easily be obtained through the World Wide Web. The files in the database are also available via anonymous ftp.
 In 1994 we described a list of ∼2500 point mutations in the p53 gene of human tumors and cell lines which we had compiled from the published literature and made available electronically through the file server at the EMBL Data Library. This database, updated twice a year, now contains records on 4496 published mutations (July 1995 release) and can be obtained from the EMBL Outstation-the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) through the network or on CD-ROM. This report describes the criteria for inclusion of data in this database, a description of the current format and a brief discussion of the current relevance of p53 mutation analysis to clinical and biological questions. 
In order to facilitate easy access to and aid understanding of the causes of haemophilia A at the molecular level we have constructed HAMSTeRS, the third release of the factor VIII mutation database and the first release of this database that may be accessed and interrogated over the internet through a World Wide Web browser. The database also presents a review of the structure and function of factor VIII and the molecular genetics of haemophilia A, a real time update of the biostatistics of each parameter in the database, a molecular model of the A1, A2 and A3 domains of the factor VIII protein (based on the crystal structure of caeruloplasmin) and a bulletin board for discussion of issues in the molecular biology of factor VIII.
The GenBank sequence database continues to expand its data coverage, quality control, annotation content and retrieval services. GenBank is comprised of DNA sequences submitted directly by authors as well as sequences from the other major public databases. An integrated retrieval system, known as Entrez, contains data from GenBank and from the major protein sequence and structural databases, as well as related MEDLINE abstracts. Users may access GenBank over the Internet through the World Wide Web and through special client-server programs for text and sequence similarity searching. FTP, CD-ROM and e-mail servers are alternate means of access.
The coagulation cascade is controlled by several anticoagulant safeguards that avoid excessive clot formation. Disorders of these anticoagulant mechanisms are an important health problem, as they lead to increased risk of thromboembolism. Protein C deficiency is probably the most extensively studied abnormality in natural anticoagulants. Under the auspices of the Subcommittee on Plasma Coagulation Inhibitors of the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis a working party of researchers maintains a database of mutations that have been characterized in the protein C gene. The 1995 update of this database comprises 331 entries that describe 160 unique mutational events. Here essential features of the database are reviewed.
 YPD is a database for the proteins of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae . YPD has two formats: (i) a spreadsheet which tabulates many of the physical and functional properties of yeast proteins, and (ii) the YPD Protein Reports which are formatted pages containing the protein properties, annotations gathered from the literature, and references with titles. YPD is available through the World-Wide Web, through an Email server, and by anonymous FTP. New releases of the YPD spreadsheet are produced every two to four months, and the on-line information is updated daily. 
 We continued our effort to make a comprehensive database (LISTA) for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevi-siae . As in previous editions [Dôlz,R., Mossé,M.-O., Slonimski, P.P., Bairoch,A. and Linder,P. (1994) Nucleic Acids Res . 22, 3459–3461] the genetic names are consistently associated to each sequence with a known and confirmed ORF. If necessary, synonyms are given in the case of allelic duplicated sequences. Although the first publication of a sequence gives—according to our rules—the genetic name of a gene, in some instances more commonly used names are given to avoid nomenclature problems and the use of ancient designations which are no longer used. In these cases the old designation is given as synonym. Thus sequences can be found either by the name or by synonyms given in LISTA. Each entry contains the genetic name, the mnemonic from the EMBL data bank, the codon bias, reference of the publication of the sequence, Chromosomal location as far as known, SWISSPROT and EMBL accession numbers. New entries will also contain the name from the systematic sequencing efforts. Since the release of LISTA4.1 we update the database continuously. To obtain more information on the included sequences, each entry has been screened against non-redundant nucleotide and protein data bank collections resulting in LISTA-HON and LISTA-HOP. This release includes reports from full Smith and Watermann peptide-level searches against a non-redundant protein sequence database. The LISTA data base can be linked to the associated data sets or to nucleotide and protein banks by the Sequence Retrieval System (SRS). The database is available by FTP and on World Wide Web. 
 PRINTS is a compendium of protein motif ‘fingerprints’ derived from the OWL composite sequence database. Fingerprints are groups of motifs within sequence alignments whose conserved nature allows them to be used as signatures of family membership. To date, 400 fingerprints have been constructed and stored in PRINTS, the size of which has doubled in the last year. The current version, 9.0, encodes ∼2000 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides, and so on. Fingerprints inherently offer improved diagnostic reliability over single motif methods by virtue of the mutual context provided by motif neighbours. PRINTS thus provides a useful adjunct to the widely used PROSITE dictionary of patterns. The database is now accessible via the Database Browser on the UCL Bioinformatics server at http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser . 
 We have developed a comprehensive database (MITOMAP) for the human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the first component of the human genome to be completely sequenced [Anderson et al. (1981) Nature 290, 457–465]. MITOMAP uses the mtDNA sequence as the unifying element for bringing together information on mitochondrial genome structure and function, pathogenic mutations and their clinical characteristics, population associated variation, and gene-gene interactions. As increasingly larger regions of the human genome are sequenced and characterized, the need for integrating such information will grow. Consequently, MITOMAP not only provides a valuable reference for the mitochondrial biologist, it may also provide a model for the development of information storage and retrieval systems for other components of the human genome. 
 O-GLYCBASE is a comprehensive database of information on glycoproteins and their O -linked glycosylationsites. Entries are compiled and revised from the SWISS-PROT and PIR databases as well as directly from recently published reports. Nineteen percent of the entries extracted from the databases needed revision with respect to O -linked glycosylation. Entries include information about species, sequence, glycosylation site and glycan type, and are fully referenced. Sequence logos displaying the acceptor specificity for the GalNAc transferase is shown. A neural network method for prediction of mucin type O -glycosylation sites in mammalian glycoproteins exclusively from the primary sequence is made available by E-mail or WWW. The O-GLYCBASE database is also available electronically through our WWW server or by anonymous FTP. 
The Directory of P450-containing Systems on World-Wide Web has been designed to facilitate access to electronic resources for all researchers working in the field of P450-containing and related enzyme systems. Currently, it contains the most up-to-date list of sequences of both the P450 superfamily and proteins mediating electron transfer to P450, i.e. NADPH:P450 reductases, specific NAD(P)H:ferredoxin reductases, cytochrome b5 reductases, ferredoxins and cytochromes b5, and their homologues. All the referenced sequences are provided with accession numbers and links to major sequence databanks: PIR, SWISS-PROT, EMBL/GenBank and PRF. An associated database of steroid substrates and products of P450-dependent reactions has also been developed.
The compilation of 5S rRNA and 5S rRNA gene nucleotide sequences as of 30 September 1996, contains a total of 1661 primary structures of 5S rRNAs or their genes, which is an increase of 928 new sequence entries over the last compilation. It covers sequences from 54 archaea, 449 eubacteria, 34 plastids, nine mitochondria and 430 eukaryotes. The databank uses the format of the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library complemented by a Sequence Alignment (SA) field including secondary structure information. The taxonomic classification of organisms was totally updated. Now the database is also available via anonymous FTP or WWW.
An update is given on the Database of Expected Fold classes (DEF) that contains a collection of fold-class predictions made from protein sequences and a mail server that provides new predictions for new sequences. To any given sequence one of 49 foldclasses is chosen to classify the structure related to the sequence with high accuracy. The updated prediction system is developed using data from the new version of the 3D-ALI database of aligned protein structures and thus is giving more reliable and more detailed predictions than the previous DEF system.
The Ribosomal RNA Mutation Databases (16SMDB and 23SMDB) provide lists of mutated positions in 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli and the identity of each alteration. Information provided for each mutation includes: (i) a brief description of the phenotype(s) associated with each mutation; (ii) whether a mutant phenotype has been detected by in vivo or in vitro methods; and (iii) relevant literature citations. The databases are available via ftp and on the World Wide Web. Expansion of the databases to include information about mutations isolated in organisms other than E. coli is currently in progress.
DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) began its activities in 1986 in collaboration with EMBL in Europe and GenBank in the United States. DDBJ developed a data submission tool called Sakura, by which researchers can submit their newly sequenced data on WWW from every corner of the world. The data bank also built a database management system (Yamato II), incorporating the techniques and functions of the object-oriented database, in order to efficiently process the data it has collected. A number of research activities in information biology are also going on at DDBJ. Two such activities are also briefly introduced in this report.
The RNA modification database provides a comprehensive listing of posttranscriptionally modified nucleosides from all RNAs, and is maintained as an updated version of the initial printed report [Limbach, P.A., Crain,P.F. and McCloskey,J.A. (1994) Nucleic Acids Res., 22, 2183–2196]. Information provided for each nucleoside includes: the RNA in which it occurs and phylogenetic distribution; common chemical name and symbol; Chemical Abstracts registry number and index name; chemical structure; initial literature citations for structural characterization or occurrence, and for chemical synthesis. The data are available through the WWW and via anonymous ftp.
The Encyclopedia of Genes and Metabolism (EcoCyc) is a database that combines information about the genome and the intermediary metabolism of Escherichia coli. It describes 2970 genes of E.coli, 547 enzymes encoded by these genes, 702 metabolic reactions that occur in E.coli and the organization of these reactions into 107 metabolic pathways. The EcoCyc graphical user interface allows scientists to query and explore the EcoCyc database using visualization tools such as genomic-map browsers and automatic layouts of metabolic pathways. EcoCyc spans the space from sequence to function to allow scientists to investigate an unusually broad range of questions. EcoCyc can be thought of as both an electronic review article because of its copious references to the primary literature, and as an in silicio model of E.coli metabolism that can be probed and analyzed through computational means.
In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of p53 mutations identified in human cancers. The p53 mutation database consists of a list of point mutations in the p53 gene of human tumors and cell lines, compiled from the published literature and made available through electronic media. The database is now maintained at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and is updated twice a year. The current version contains records on 5091 published mutations and is expected to surpass the 6000 mark in the January 1997 release. The database is available in various formats through the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) ftp server at: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/p53/ or by request from IARC (p53database@iarc.fr) and will be searchable through the SRS system in the near future. This report provides a description of the criteria for inclusion of data and of the current formats, a summary of the relevance of p53 mutation analysis to clinical and biological questions, and a brief discussion of the prospects for future developments.
O-GLYCBASE is an updated database of information on glycoproteins and their O-linked glycosylation sites. Entries are compiled and revised from the literature, and from the SWISS-PROT database. Entries include information about species, sequence, glycosylation sites and glycan type. O-GLYCBASE is now fully cross-referenced to the SWISS-PROT, PIR, PROSITE, PDB, EMBL, HSSP, LISTA and MIM databases. Compared with version 1.0 the number of entries have increased by 34%. Revision of the O-glycan assignment was performed on 20% of the entries. Sequence logos displaying the acceptor specificity patterns for the GalNAc, mannose and GlcNAc transferases are shown. The O-GLYCBASE database is available through WWW or by anonymous FTP.
FlyBase is a database of genetic and molecular data concerning Drosophila. FlyBase is maintained as a relational database (in Sybase) and is made available as html documents and flat files. The scope of FlyBase includes: genes, alleles (and phenotypes), aberrations, transposons, pointers to sequence data, clones, stock lists, Drosophila workers and bibliographic references. The Encyclopaedia of Drosophila is a joint effort between FlyBase and the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project which integrates FlyBase data with those from the BDGP.
Fibrillin is the major component of extracellular microfibrils. Mutations in the fibrillin gene on chromosome 15 (FBN1) were described at first in the heritable connective tissue disorder, Marfan syndrome (MFS). More recently, FBN1 has also been shown to harbor mutations related to a spectrum of conditions phenotypically related to MFS. These mutations are private, essentially missense, generally non-recurrent and widely distributed throughout the gene. To date no clear genotype/phenotype relationship has been observed excepted for the localization of neonatal mutations in a cluster between exons 24 and 32. The second version of the computerized Marfan database contains 89 entries. The software has been modified to accomodate new functions and routines.
The Genome Sequence DataBase (GSDB) has completed its conversion to an improved relational database. The new database, GSDB 1.0, is fully operational and publicly available. Data contributions, including both original sequence submissions and community annotation, are being accomplished through the use of a graphical client-server interface tool, the GSDB Annotator, and via GIO (GSDB Input/Output) files. Data retrieval services are being provided through a new Web Query Tool and direct SQL. All methods of data contribution and data retrieval fully support the new data types that have been incorporated into GSDB, including discontiguous sequences, multiple sequence alignments, and community annotation.
Each mutation spectrum in this database is a dataset of changes in DNA base sequence in mutations induced in a gene by a particular mutagen (including spontaneous processes) under defined conditions. There are 240 datasets with 24 500 mutants in nine bacterial genes, two phage genes, five mammalian genes and one yeast gene. The database is available on the Web at http://info.med.yale.edu/mutbase/. The data tables can be viewed on the Web and downloaded in text form for local use. The data are also available in dBASE III, a format which can be utilized by essentially any desktop computer database program or spreadsheet, and makes feasible analyses of a large number of mutants. Researchers are invited to submit additional data. A data entry program, MUTSIN, diagrams each mutation on the computer screen as the data are entered and alerts the user to any discrepancies between the entry and the gene sequence.
The Antwerp database on small ribosomal subunit RNA now offers more than 6000 nucleotide sequences (August 1996). All these sequences are stored in the form of an alignment based on the adopted secondary structure model, which is corroborated by the observation of compensating substitutions in the alignment. Besides the primary and secondary structure information, literature references, accession numbers and detailed taxonomic information are also compiled. For ease of use, the complete database is made available to the scientific community via World Wide Web at URL http://rrna.uia.ac.be/ssu/.
The SRPDB (Signal Recognition Particle Database) offers aligned SRP RNA and SRP protein sequences, phylogenetically ordered and annotated. This release adds three SRP RNA sequences (totaling 96 SRP RNA sequences) and 11 SRP protein sequences (a total of 39 protein sequences from SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP21, SRP54, SRP68 or SRP72). Also downloadable are sample SRP RNA secondary structure diagrams, a three-dimensional model of the human SRP RNA, search motifs and software.
X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is an immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the gene coding for Bruton's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (BTK). A database (BTKbase) of BTK mutations has been compiled and the recent update lists 368 entries from 318 unrelated families showing 228 unique molecular events. In addition to mutations the database lists also some polymorphisms and site-directed mutations. Each patient is given a unique patient identity number (PIN). Information is provided regarding the phenotype including symptoms. Mutations in all the five domains of BTK have been noticed to cause the disease, the most common event being missense mutations. The mutations appear almost uniformly throughout the molecule and frequently affect CpG sites forming arginine residues. These hot spots have generally pyrimidines 5′ and purines 3′ to the mutated cytosine. A decreased frequency of missense mutations was found in the TH, SH3 and the upper lobe of the kinase domain. The putative structural implications of all the missense mutations are given in the database showing 228 unique molecular events, including a novel missense mutation causing an R28C substitution as previously seen in the Xid mouse.
Ribonuclease P is responsible for the removal of leader sequences from tRNA precursors. Ribonuclease P is a ribonucleoprotein, and in bacteria the RNA subunit alone is catalytically active in vitro, i.e. it is a ribozyme. The Ribonuclease P Database is a compilation of ribonuclease P sequences, sequence alignments, secondary structures, three-dimensional models, and accessory information, available via the World Wide Web.
Since July 1995, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) has maintained RHdb, a public database for radiation hybrid data. Radiation hybrid data are used in the generation of alternative genetic maps as they can include non-polymorphic markers and are also powerful enough to order unresolved genetic clusters of polymorphic STSs. The EBI is an Outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).
The Blocks Database contains multiple alignments of conserved regions in protein families which can be searched by e-mail (blocks@blocks.fhcrc.org) and World Wide Web (http://blocks.fhcrc.org/) servers to classify protein and nucleotide sequences. Recent enhancements to the servers include: (i) improved calculation of position-specific scoring matrices from blocks; (ii) availability of the Prints protein fingerprint database for searching in Blocks format; (iii) a representative sequence biased towards the Blocks of a protein family; (iv) a tree constructed from the Blocks of a protein family; (v) links to related World Wide Web pages for a family; and (vi) the new Local Alignment of Multiple Alignments (LAMA) method to search a block against a database of blocks.
We have compiled the DNA sequence data for Escherichia coli available from the GenBank and EMBL data libraries and independently from the literature. We provide the most definitive version of the ECD Escherichia coli database now exclusively via the World Wide Web System: http://susi.bio.uni-giessen.de/usr/local/www/html/ecdc.html. Our database encloses an assembled set of contiguous sequences. Each of these contigs compiles all available sequence information, including those derived from a variety of elder sequences. The organisation of the database allows precise physical location of each individual gene or regulatory region, even taking into consideration discrepancies in nomenclature. The WWW program allows to branch into the original EMBL and SWIS-SPROT datafiles. A number of links to other WWW servers is provided. A FASTA and BLAST search may be performed online. Besides the WWW format a flat file version may be obtained via ftp. The ftp version may also be obtained from the EMBL data library as part of the CD-ROM issue of the EMBL sequence database, which is released and updated every 3 months. After deletion of all detected overlaps a total of 3 588 706 individual bp has been determined up to the end of September 1996. This corresponds to a total of 77.09% of the entire E.coli chromosome consisting of ∼4655 kb. About 479 kb (10.3%) are additionally available from Kyoto (Japan). Another 94 kb (2%) are available, but mapping has not been confirmed. Thus the total may have reached 89.4%.
From its origin, the PIR has aspired to support research in computational biology and genomics through the compilation of a comprehensive, quality controlled and well-organized protein sequence information resource. The resource originated with the pioneering work of the late Margaret O. Dayhoff in the early 1960s. Since 1988, the Protein Sequence Database has been maintained collaboratively by PIR-International, an association of macromolecular sequence data collection centers dedicated to fostering international cooperation as an essential element in the development of scientific databases. The work of the resource is widely distributed and is available on the World Wide Web, via FTP, E-mail server, CD-ROM and magnetic media. It is widely redistributed and incorporated into many other protein sequence data compilations including SWISS-PROT and the Entrez system of the NCBI.
The codon usage in individual protein genes has been calculated using the nucleotide sequence obtained from the GenBank Genetic Sequence Database. Sum of the codon use of each organism has been also calculated. The data files can be obtained from anonymous ftp sites of DDBJ, DISC and EBI. The list of codon usage of genes in organisms was made searchable by name of organism through a web site. The compilation has been synchronized with a major release of GenBank.
A database of aligned histone protein sequences has been constructed based on the results of homology searches of the major public sequence databases. In addition, sequences of proteins identified as containing the histone fold motif and structures of all known histone and histone fold proteins have been included in the current release. Database resources include information on conflicts between similar sequence entries in different source databases, multiple sequence alignments, and links to the Entrez integrated information retrieval system at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The database currently contains over 1000 protein sequences. All sequences and alignments in this database are available through the World Wide Web at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Baxevani/HISTONES/.
The MIPS group (Martinsried Institute for Protein Sequences) at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried near Munich, Germany, collects, processes and distributes protein sequence data within the framework of the tripartite association of the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database (1,2). MIPS contributes nearly 50% of the data input to the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database. The database is distributed on CD-ROM together with PATCHX, an exhaustive supplement of unique, unverified protein sequences from external sources compiled by MIPS. Through its WWW server (http://www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/) MIPS permits internet access to sequence databases, homology data and to yeast genome information. (i) Sequence similarity results from the FASTA program (3) are stored in the FASTA database for all proteins from PIR-International and PATCHX. The database is dynamically maintained and permits instant access to FASTA results. (ii) Starting with FASTA database queries, proteins have been classified into families and superfamilies (PROT-FAM). (iii) The HPT (hashed position tree) data structure (4) developed at MIPS is a new approach for rapid sequence and pattern searching. (iv) MIPS provides access to the sequence and annotation of the complete yeast genome (5), the functional classification of yeast genes (FunCat) and its graphical display, the ‘Genome Browser’ (6). A CD-ROM based on the JAVA programming language providing dynamic interactive access to the yeast genome and the related protein sequences has been compiled and is available on request.
In the context of the international project aiming at sequencing the whole genome of Bacillus subtilis we have developed NRSub, a non-redundant database of sequences from this organism. Starting from the B.subtilis sequences available in the repository collections we have removed all encountered duplications, then we have added extra annotations to the sequences (e.g. accession numbers for the genes, locations on the genetic map, codon usage index). We have also added cross-references with EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ, MEDLINE, SWISS-PROT and ENZYME databases. NRSub is distributed through anonymous FTP as a text file in EMBL format and as an ACNUC database. It is also possible to access the database through two dedicated World Wide Web servers located in France (http://acnuc.univ-lyon1.fr/nrsub/nrsub.html) and in Japan (http://ddbjs4h.genes.nig.ac.jp/).
REBASE is a comprehensive database of information about restriction enzymes and their associated methylases, including their recognition and cleavage sites and their commercial availability. Information from REBASE is available via monthly electronic mailings as well as via anonymous ftp, WAIS/gopher and through the World Wide Web (http://www.neb.com/rebase). Specialized files are available that can be used directly by many software packages.
We have created databases and software applications for the analysis of DNA mutations at the human p53 gene, the human hprt gene and both the rodent transgenic lacI and lacZ locus. The databases themselves are stand-alone dBASE files and the software for analysis of the databases runs on IBM-compatible computers. Each database has a separate software analysis program. The software created for these databases permit the filtering, ordering, report generation and display of information in the database. In addition, a significant number of routines have been developed for the analysis of single base substitutions. One method of obtaining the databases and software is via the World Wide Web (WWW). Open the following home page with a Web Browser: http://sunsite.unc.edu/dnam/mainpage.html. Alternatively, the databases and programs are available via public FTP from: anonymous@sunsite.unc.edu. There is no password required to enter the system. The databases and software are found beneath the subdirectory: pub/academic/biology/dna-mutations. Two other programs are available at the site—a program for comparison of mutational spectra and a program for entry of mutational data into a relational database.
Three databases that provide data on transcriptional regulation are described. TRANSFAC is a database on transcription factors and their DNA binding sites. TRRD (Transcription Regulatory Region Database) collects information about complete regulatory regions, their regulation properties and architecture. COMPEL comprises specific information on composite regulatory elements. Here, we describe the present status of these databases and the first steps towards their federation.
The PRINTS database of protein family ‘fingerprints’ is a diagnostic resource that complements the PROSITE dictionary of sites and patterns. Unlike regular expressions, fingerprints exploit groups of conserved motifs within sequence alignments to build characteristic signatures of family membership. Thus fingerprints inherently offer improved diagnostic reliability by virtue of the mutual context provided by motif neighbours. To date, 600 fingerprints have been constructed and stored in PRINTS, representing a 50% increase in the size of the database in the last year. The current version, 13.0, encodes ∼3000 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides, and so on. The database is accessible via UCL's Bioinformatics World Wide Web (WWW) server at http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/. We describe here progress with the database, its Web interface, and a recent exciting development: the integration of a novel colour alignment editor (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/CINEMA), which allows visualisation and interactive manipulation of PRINTS alignments over the Internet.
The latest release of the large ribosomal subunit RNA database contains 429 sequences. All these sequences are aligned, and incorporate secondary structure information. The rRNA WWW Server at URL http://rrna.uia.ac.be/ provides researchers with an easily accessible resource to obtain the data in this database in a number of computer-readable formats. A new query interface has been added to the server. If necessary, the data can also be obtained by anonymous ftp from the same site.
MHCPEP is a curated database comprising over 9000 peptide sequences known to bind MHC molecules. Entries are compiled from published reports as well as from direct submissions of experimental data. Each entry contains the peptide sequence, its MHC specificity and, when available, experimental method, observed activity, binding affinity, source protein, anchor positions and publication references. The present format of the database allows text string matching searches but can easily be converted for use in conjunction with sequence analysis packages. The database can be accessed via Internet using WWW, FTP or Gopher.
The value of the Genome Database (GDB) for the human genome research community has been greatly increased since the release of version 6.0 last year. Thanks to the introduction of significant technical improvements, GDB has seen dramatic growth in the type and volume of information stored in the database. This article summarizes the types of data that are now available in the Genome Database, demonstrates how the database is interconnected with other biomedical resources on the World Wide Web, discusses how researchers can contribute new or updated information to the database, and describes our current efforts as well as planned improvements for the future.
We have continued to develop MITOMAP, a comprehensive database for the human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). MITOMAP uses the mtDNA sequence as the unifying element for bringing together information on mitochondrial genome structure and function, pathogenic mutations and their clinical characteristics, population associated variation and gene-gene interactions. As increasingly larger regions of the human genome are sequenced and characterized, the need for integrating such information will grow. Consequently, MITOMAP not only provides a valuable reference for the mitochondrial biologist, it will also provide a model for the development of comprehensive, multi-media information storage and retrieval systems for other components of the human genome. This paper is an update of the changes which have occurred to MITOMAP over the past year.
A large number of different mutations in the APC and p53 tumor suppressor genes have been identified in various types of cancer. This substantial increase since our previous reports can enable analyses which were not previously possible. In order to capture all these new data, the software permitting analysis has been improved. This report describes the various improvements since the second release of the database.
TransTerm is a database of initiation and termination sequence contexts from more than 250 organisms listed in GenBank, including the four complete genomes: Haemophilus influenzae, Methanococcus jannaschii, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For the current release, more than 60 000 coding sequences were analysed. The tabulated data include initiation and termination contexts organised by species along with quantitative parameters about individual coding sequences (length, %GC, GC3, Nc and CAI). There are also tables of initiation- and termination-region nucleotide-frequencies, codon usage tables and summaries of stop signal usage. TransTerm is available on the World Wide Web at: http://biochem.otago.ac.nz:800/Transterm/homepage.html
ESTHER (for esterases, α/β hydrolase enzyme and relatives) is a database of sequences phylogenetically related to cholinesterases. These sequences define a homogeneous group of enzymes (carboxylesterases, lipases and hormone-sensitive lipases) sharing a similar structure of a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. Among these proteins a wide range of functions can be found (hydrolases, adhesion molecules, hormone precursors). The purpose of ESTHER is to help comparison of structures and functions of members of the family. Since the last release, new features have been added to the server. A BLAST comparison tool allows sequence homology searches within the database sequences. New sections are available: kinetics and inhibitors of cholinesterases, fasciculin-acetylcholinesterase interaction and a gene structure review. The mutation analysis compilation has been improved with three-dimensional images. A mailing list has been created.
GIF-DB (Gene Interactions in the Fly Database) is a new WWW database (http://www-biol.univ-mrs.fr/∼lgpd/GIFTS_home_page.html) describing gene molecular interactions involved in the process of embryonic pattern formation in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. The detailed information is distributed in specific lines arranged into an EMBL- (or SWISS-PROT-) like format. GIF-DB achieves a high level of integration with other databases such as FlyBase, EMBL and SWISS-PROT through numerous hyperlinks. The original concept of interaction databases examplified by GIF-DB could be extended to other biological subjects and organisms so as to study gene regulatory networks in an evolutionary perspective.
The uRNADB offers aligned, annotated and phylo-genetically ordered sequences of several U RNAs. New to this release are RNAs from U7 (14 sequences), U8 (two sequences), U11 (three sequences), U12 (two sequences), U14 (11 sequences), U18, U48 and U49. A total of 34 new sequences were aligned with the previously compiled snRNAs U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U6.
We have expanded the original Glucocorticoid Receptor Resource (GRR) database to include several individual resources as part of a larger project called the Nuclear Receptor Resource (NRR). In addition to the GRR, the NRR currently features the Thyroid Hormone Receptor Resource, the Androgen Receptor Resource, the Mineralocorticoid Receptor Resource, the Vitamin D Receptor Resource, and the Steroid Receptor Associated Proteins Resource. The goal of the NRR project is to provide a comprehensive resource for information on the nuclear receptor superfamily, and to provide a forum for the dissemination and discussion of both published and unpublished material on these proteins. Although the individual resources are managed from different servers, all the files are integrated and can be accessed through the project's Home Page, housed at http://nrr.georgetown.edu/nrr.html. In the near future, we hope to expand the project to contain information on other nuclear receptors and to better our electronic publication system. To accomplish this, we encourage the involvement of nuclear receptor investigators in the NRR.
GenProtEC is a database of Escherichia coli genes and their gene products, classified by type of function and physiological role and with citations to the literature for each. Also present are data on sequence similarities among E. coli proteins with PAM values, percent identity of amino acids, length of alignment and percent aligned. GenProtEC can also be accessed through the World Wide Web at URL http://mbl.edu/html/ecoli.html.
The FSSP database presents a continuously updated structural classification of three-dimensional protein folds. It is derived using an automatic structure comparison program (Dali) for the all-against-all comparison of over 6000 three-dimensional coordinate sets in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Sequence-related protein families are covered by a representative set of 813 protein chains. Hierachical clustering based on structural similarities yields a fold tree that defines 253 fold classes. For each representative protein chain, there is a database entry containing structure-structure alignments with its structural neighbours in the PDB. The database is accessible online through World Wide Web browsers and by anonymous ftp (file transfer protocol). The overview of fold space and the individual data sets provide a rich source of information for the study of both divergent and convergent aspects of molecular evolution, and define useful test sets and a standard of truth for assessing the correctness of sequence-sequence or sequence-structure alignments.
Molecular Probe Data Base contains detailed information on synthetic oligonucleotides with a sequence of up to 100 nucleotides. This database prevalently contains information related to human oligonucleotides used in diagnostics. Molecular Probe Data Base has been made available on-line through the Internet by means of Network Information Retrieval (NIR) tools since 1993. Two years ago, a collaboration with EMBL Data Library was also set up, so that the Molecular Probe Data Base has been integrated with other molecular biology data banks in the sphere of the SRS WWW network browser. In this paper, the most recent enhancements and the current status of the Molecular Probe Data Base are briefly presented.
HSSP is a derived database merging structural (3-D) and sequence (1-D) information. For each protein of known 3-D structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the database has a multiple sequence alignment of all available homologues and a sequence profile characteristic of the family. The list of homologues is the result of a database search in SwissProt using a position-weighted dynamic programming method for sequence profile alignment (MaxHom). The database is updated frequently. The listed homologues are very likely to have the same 3-D structure as the PDB protein to which they have been aligned. As a result, the database is not only a database of aligned sequence families, but also a database of implied secondary and tertiary structures covering 29% of all SwissProt-stored sequences.
The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) is a comprehensive community resource of mouse genetic and biological information populated both with data from published literature and with data electronically submitted from the research community. MGD stores genetic, physical and comparative mapping data, clones/probes/PCR information, and phenotype descriptions for genes, mutations and mouse strains. Supporting software for importation, analysis, display and distribution of mouse genetic data have been developed. User support is provided through dedicated staff providing documentation, training, and response to individual user queries. MGD is accessible over the Internet at URL http://www.informatics.jax.org.
Recently, we developed and made available an online database that includes all the reported (to our knowledge) viroid and viroid-like RNA sequences [Bussire, F., Lafontaine,D. and Perreault,J.-P. (1996) Nucleic Acids Res. 24, 1793–1798]. We report here an update of this catalogue which includes the addition of a new section devoted to human hepatitis delta virus (vHDV) sequences. This new section comprises all available vHDV sequences, irrespective of their completeness, which have been either published or were available from nucleic acid libraries. Additional structural characteristics of the vHDV genome, such as the positions of the self-catalytic domains, the antigen open reading frames, etc., are also included. The catalogue is available on the World Wide Web (http://www.callisto.si.usherb.ca/∼jpperra) in a user-friendly form. It should provide an excellent reference point for further molecular studies of these small circular pathogenic RNAs.
SWISS-PROT is a curated protein sequence database which strives to provide a high level of annotations (such as the description of the function of a protein, structure of its domains, post-translational modifications, variants, etc.), a minimal level of redundancy and high level of integration with other databases. Recent developments of the database include: an increase in the number and scope of model organisms; cross-references to two additional databases; a variety of new documentation files and the creation of TrEMBL, a computer annotated supplement to SWISS-PROT. This supplement consists of entries in SWISS-PROT-like format derived from the translation of all coding sequences (CDS) in the EMBL nucleotide sequence database, except the CDS already included in SWISS-PROT.
The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database is a comprehensive database of DNA and RNA sequences directly submitted from researchers and genome sequencing groups and collected from the scientific literature and patent applications. In collaboration with DDBJ and GenBank the database is produced, maintained and distributed at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and constitutes Europe's primary nucleotide sequence resource. Database releases are produced quarterly and are distributed on CD-ROM. EBI's network services allow access to the most up-to-date data collection via Internet and World Wide Web interface, providing database searching and sequence similarity facilities plus access to a large number of additional databases.
Type I collagen is the most abundant and ubiquitously distributed of the collagen family of proteins. It is a heterotrimer comprising two α1(I) chains and one α2(I) chain which are encoded by the unlinked loci COL1A1 and COL1A2 respectively. Mutations at these loci result primarily in the connective tissue disorders osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome types VIIA and VIIB. Two instances of osteoporosis and a single instance of Marfan syndrome are also the result of mutations at these loci. The mutation data are accessible on the world wide web at http://www.le.ac.uk/depts/ge/collagen/collagen.html
A website (http://www.mcgill.ca/pahdb ) is maintained by the curators for a Consortium (88 investigators, 28 countries) and all other users; it serves a relational database for human locus-specific genetic variation in a defined DNA sequence (GenBank U49897); (100 kb on human chromosome 12q24.1, gene symbol PAH). The intragenic nucleotide variation is both rare (Q < 0.01), extensive (>320 different mutations) and phenotype modifying, causing hyperphenylalaninemia by impairing phenylalanine hydroxylase function (see OMIM 261600), as well as polymorphic and neutral, the latter providing informative locus-specific haplotypes (>1200 different mutation/haplotye associations). The PAH database contains both offline core components (mutations, population associations and data source information) and several accessory online components: (i) relative frequencies of mutations by populations/regions (expanding file); (ii) data on genotype-phenotype correlations both in vitro and in vivo (new file); (iii) polymorphic haplotype structures (new file); (iv) intron sequence data (new file for design of primers); (v) description of mouse homologues (new file for mutations and phenotypes); (vi) the predicted PAH gene mutability profile (improved graphic); (vii) a clinical field for patient use (new interface with database). The website home page has been revised and a counter is recording >15 visits per day. Linkages to other mutation databases and an alliance of mutation database curators (new) are expanding. The primary ‘electronic publication’ reports now vastly exceed print reports. PAHdb serves as a prototype for obtaining, storing and distributing records of human genetic variation.
IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics database, is an integrated database specializing in immunoglobulins, T-cell receptors (TcR) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of all vertebrate species, initiated and co-ordinated by Marie-Paule Lefranc, CNRS, Montpellier II University, Montpellier, France (lefranc@ligm.crbm.cnrs-mop.fr). IMGT includes two databases: LIGM-DB (for immunoglobulins and TcR) and MHC/HLA-DB. IMGT comprises expertly annotated sequences and alignment tables. LIGM-DB contains more than 19 000 immunoglobulin and TcR sequences from 78 species. MHC/HLA-DB contains class I and class II human leukocyte antigen alignment tables. An IMGT tool, DNAPLOT, developed for immunoglobulins, TcR and MHC sequence alignments, is also available. IMGT works in close collaboration with the EMBL database. IMGT goals are to establish a common data access to all immunogenetics data, including sequences, oligonucleotide primers, gene maps and other genetic data of immunoglobulins, TcR and MHC molecules, and to provide a graphical user-friendly data access. IMGT will have important implications in medical research (repertoire in autoimmune diseases, AIDS, leukemias, lymphomas), therapeutical approaches (antibody engineering), genome diversity and genome evolution studies. IMGT can be accessed at http://imgt.cnusc.fr:8104 and http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IMGT
The Yeast Protein Database (YPD) is a database for the proteins of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. YPD is the first annotated database for the complete proteome of any organism. Now that the complete genome sequence of yeast is available, YPD contains entries for each of the characterized proteins and for each of the uncharacterized proteins predicted from the sequence. Contained in YPD are the calculated properties of each protein such as molecular weight and isoelectric point, experimentally determined properties such as subcellular localization and post-translational modifications, and extensive annotations from the yeast literature. YPD contains 25 000 lines of textual annotation that describe the known functions, mutant phenotypes, interactions, and other properties for the approximately 6000 proteins in the yeast proteome. The information in YPD is updated daily, and it is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.proteome.com/YPDhome.html.
The HAMSTeRS WWW site was set up in 1996 in order to facilitate easy access to, and aid understanding of, the causes of haemophilia A at the molecular level; previously, the first and second text editions of the database have been published in Nucleic Acids Research. This report describes the facilities originally available at the site and the recent additions which we have made to increase its usefulness to clinicians, the molecular genetics community and structural biologists interested in factor VIII. The database (version 3.0) has been completely updated with easy submission of point mutations, deletions and insertions via e-mail of custom-designed forms. The searching of point mutations in the database has been made simpler and more robust, with a concomitantly expanded real-time bioinformatic analysis of the database. A methods section devoted to mutation detection has been added, highlighting issues such as choice of technique and PCR primer sequences. Finally, a FVIII structure section gives access to 3D VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language) files for any user-definable residue in a FVIII A domain homology model based on the crystal structure of human caeruloplasmin, together with secondary structural data and a sound+video animation of the model. It is intended that the general availability of this model will assist both in interpretation of causative mutations and selection of candidate residues for in vitro mutagenesis. The HAMSTeRS URL is http://europium.mrc.rpms.ac.uk.
The PROSITE database consists of biologically significant patterns and profiles formulated in such a way that with appropriate computational tools it can help to determine to which known family of protein (if any) a new sequence belongs, or which known domain(s) it contains.
SBASE 5.0 is the fifth release of SBASE, a collection of annotated protein domain sequences that represent various structural, functional, ligand-binding and topogenic segments of proteins. SBASE was designed to facilitate the detection of functional homologies and can be searched with standard database-search programs. The present release contains over 79863 entries provided with standardized names and is cross-referenced to all major sequence databases and sequence pattern collections. The information is assigned to individual domains rather than to entire protein sequences, thus SBASE contains substantially more cross-references and links than do the protein sequence databases. The entries are clustered into >16 000 groups in order to facilitate the detection of distant similarities. SBASE 5.0 is freely available by anonymous ‘ftp’ file transfer from <ftp.icgeb.trieste.it >. Automated searching of SBASE with BLAST can be carried out with the WWW-server <http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/sbase/ >. and with the electronic mail server <sbase@icgeb.trieste.it > which now also provides a graphic representation of the homologies. A related WWW-server <http://www.abc.hu/blast.html > and e-mail server <domain@hubi.abc.hu > predicts SBASE domain homologies on the basis of SWISS-PROT searches.
The small RNA database is a compilation of all the small size RNA sequences available to date, including nuclear, nucleolar, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial small RNAs from eukaryotic organisms and small RNAs from prokaryotic cells as well as viruses. Currently, about 600 small RNA sequences are in our database. It also gives the sources of individual RNAs and their GenBank accession numbers. The small RNA database can be accessed through WWW(World Wide Web). Our WWW URL address is: http://mbcr.bcm.tmc.edu/smallRNA/smallrna.html. The new small RNA sequences published since our last compilation are listed in this paper.
The RNA editing process in protozoan parasites is controlled by small RNA molecules known as guide RNAs (gRNAs). The gRNA database is a comprehensive compilation of published guide RNA sequences from eight different kinetoplastid organisms. In addition to the RNA primary sequences, information on the gene localization, the experimental verification of the transcripts, and literature citations are provided. Accessory information includes the secondary structures of four Trypanosoma brucei gRNAs as well as a computer modelled three dimensional gRNA structure. The database is made available as a hypertext document accessible via the World Wide Web (WWW) or from the authors in a printed form.
The Metabolic Pathway Collection from EMP is an extraction of data from the larger Enzymes and Metabolic Pathways database (EMP). This extraction has been made publicly available in the hope that others will find it useful for a variety of purposes. The original release in October 1995 contained 1814 distinct pathways. The current collection contains 2180. Metabolic reconstructions for the first completely sequenced organisms—Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Methanococcus janaschii—are all included in the current release. All of the pathways in the collections are available as ASCII files in the form generated by the main curator, Evgeni Selkov. In addition, we are offering a more structured encoding of a subset of the collection; our initial release of this subcollection includes all of the pathways in Mycoplasma genitalium, and we ultimately intend to offer the entire collection in this form as well.
The GenBank sequence database incorporates DNA sequences from all available public sources, primarily through the direct submission of sequence data from authors and from large-scale sequencing projects. Data exchange with the EMBL Data Library and the DNA Data Bank of Japan helps ensure comprehensive coverage. GenBank continues to focus on quality control and annotation while expanding data coverage and retrieval services. An integrated retrieval system, known as Entrez, incorporates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases, along with genome maps and protein structure information. MEDLINE abstracts from published articles describing the sequences are also included as an additional source of biological annotation. Sequence similarity searching is offered through the BLAST family of programs. All of NCBI's services are offered through the World Wide Web. In addition, there are specialized server/client versions as well as FTP and e-mail server access.
The present paper describes the structure of MmtDB—a specialized database designed to collect Metazoa mitochondrial DNA variants. Priority in the data collection is given to the Metazoa species for which a large amount of variants is available, as it is the case for human variants. Starting from the sequences available in the Nucleotide Sequence Databases, the redundant sequences are removed and new sequences from other sources are added. Value-added information are associated to each variant sequence, e.g. analysed region, experimental method, tissue and cell lines, population data, sex, age, family code and information about the variation events (nucleotide position, involved gene, restriction site's gain or loss). Cross-references are introduced to the EMBL Data Library, as well as an internal cross-referencing among MmtDB entries according to their tissual, heteroplasmic, familiar and aplotypical correlation. MmtDB can be accessed through the World Wide Web at URL http://WWW.ba.cnr.it/∼areamt08/MmtDBWWW.htm.
The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) is a curated database that offers ribosome-related data, analysis services and associated computer programs. The offerings include phylogenetically ordered alignments of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences, derived phylogenetic trees, rRNA secondary structure diagrams, and various software for handling, analyzing and displaying alignments and trees. The data are available via anonymous FTP (rdp.life.uiuc.edu), electronic mail (server@rdp.life.uiuc.edu), gopher (rdpgopher.life.uiuc.edu) and WWW (http://rdpwww.life.uiuc.edu/ ). The electronic mail and WWW servers provide ribosomal probe checking, approximate phylogenetic placement of user-submitted sequences, screening for possible chimeric rRNA sequences, automated alignment, and a suggested placement of an unknown sequence on an existing phylogenetic tree.
The Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database provides a detailed and comprehensive description of the relationships of all known proteins structures. The classification is on hierarchical levels: the first two levels, family and superfamily, describe near and far evolutionary relationships; the third, fold, describes geometrical relationships. The distinction between evolutionary relationships and those that arise from the physics and chemistry of proteins is a feature that is unique to this database, so far. SCOP also provides for each structure links to atomic co-ordinates, images of the structures, interactive viewers, sequence data, data on any conformational changes related to function and literature references. The database is freely accessible on the World Wide Web (WWW) with an entry point at URL http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/
The seventh edition of the haemophilia B database lists in easily accessible form all known factor IX mutations due to small changes (base substitutions and short additions and/or deletions of <30 bp) identified in haemophilia B patients. The 1535 patient entries are ordered by the nucleotide number of their mutation. Where known, details are given on: factor IX activity, factor IX antigen in circulation, presence of inhibitor and origin of mutation. References to published mutations are given and the laboratories generating the data are indicated.
The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) plays a pivotal role in cholesterol homeostasis. Mutations in the LDLr gene (LDLR), which is located on chromosome 19, cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia associated with premature coronary atherosclerosis. To date almost 300 mutations have been identified in the LDLR gene. To facilitate the mutational analysis of the LDLR gene, and promote the analysis of the relationship between genotype and phenotype, a software package along with a computerized database (currently listing 210 entries) have been created.
 A large number of different mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been identified in all types of cancer. As of October, 1997, this database ( http://perso.curie.fr/tsoussi ) contained >7500 mutations. Such a substantial increase since our previous reports should enable epidemiological analyses which were not previously possible. In order to analyse these new data, the UMD software has been improved. A new Web version of the UMD software enables online analysis of the database. The present report describes various improvements since the last release of the database. 
 Guide RNAs (gRNAs) are small, metabolically stable RNA molecules which perform a pivotal, template-like function during the RNA editing process in kinetoplastid protozoa. The gRNA database currently contains 250 guide RNA sequences as well as secondary and tertiary structure models and other relevant information. The database is made available as a hypertext document accessible via the World Wide Web (WWW) at the URL: http://www.biochem.mpg.de/~goeringe/
 The Database of Ribosomal Cross-links (DRC) provides a complete collection of all the published data produced by cross-linking studies on the Escherichia coli ribosome, as well as on its components and functional ligands. The DRC currently includes data on 986 cross-links from >100 research papers, yielded by >40 different reagents. For each cross-link, information is given concerning its location in the ribosome, the chemical or photochemical reagent applied, a brief description of the method(s) used to locate the cross-link, and the literature reference. The DRC is freely available via the World Wide Web at: http://Ribosome.Genebee.MSU.SU/DRC/ or at http://WWW:MPIMG-Berlin-Dahlem.MPG.DE/∼baranov/DRC/
 PRINTS is a database of protein family ‘fingerprints’ offering a diagnostic resource for newly-determined sequences. By contrast with PROSITE, which uses single consensus expressions to characterise particular families, PRINTS exploits groups of motifs to build characteristic signatures. These signatures offer improved diagnostic reliability by virtue of the mutual context provided by motif neighbours. To date, 800 fingerprints have been constructed and stored in PRINTS. The current version, 17.0, encodes ∼4500 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides, and so on. The database is accessible via the UCL Bioinformatics World Wide Web (WWW) Server at http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/ . We have recently enhanced the usefulness of PRINTS by making available new, intuitive search software. This allows both individual query sequence and bulk data submission, permitting easy analysis of single sequences or complete genomes. Preliminary results indicate that use of the PRINTS system is able to assign additional functions not found by other methods, and hence offers a useful adjunct to current genome analysis protocols. 
 The Genome Database (GDB, http://www.gdb.org ) is a public repository of data on human genes, clones, STSs, polymorphisms and maps. GDB entries are highly cross-linked to each other, to literature citations and to entries in other databases, including the sequence databases, OMIM, and the Mouse Genome Database. Mapping data from large genome centers and smaller mapping efforts are added to GDB on an ongoing basis. The database can be searched by a variety of methods, ranging from keyword searches to complex queries. Major functionality extensions in the last year include the ongoing computation of integrated human genome maps, called Comprehensive Maps, and the use of those maps to support positional queries and graphic displays. The capabilities of the GDB map viewer (Mapview) have been extended to include map printing and the graphical display of ad hoc query results. The HUGO Nomenclature Committee continues to curate the proposed and official gene symbols and related data in collaboration with GDB. As genome research shifts its emphasis from mapping to sequencing and functional analysis, the scope of the GDB schema is being extended. We are in the process of adding representations of gene function and expression, and improving our representation of human polymorphism and mutation. 
 The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) is an annotated non-redundant collection of experimentally characterised eukaryotic POL II promoters. The underlying definition of a promoter is that of a transcription initiation site. All information presented in EPD results from an independent evaluation of primary experimental data shown in the biological literature. Sequences flanking transcription initiation sites are indirectly given by pointers to EMBL sequences. The annotation part of a promoter entry includes description of the promoter-defining evidence, cross-references to other databases, and bibliographic references. Being designed as a resource for comparative sequence analysis, EPD is structured in a way that facilitates dynamic extraction of biologically meaningful promoter subsets. The database is available through the World Wide Web at URL http://cmpteam4.unil.ch
 Since 1996 the HAMSTeRS (Haemophilia A Mutation, Search, Test and Resource Site) WWW site has provided an online resource for access to data on the molecular pathology of haemophilia A, replacing previous text editions of the Haemophilia A Database published in Nucleic Acids Research . This report describes the continued development of the site (version 4), and in particular the expansion of factor VIII (FVIII) structure-related features. Access to the mutation database itself, both for searching the listings and for submission of new mutations, is via customdesigned forms: more powerful Boolean searches of the point mutations in the database are also available. During 1997 a total of 22 novel missense mutations were reported, increasing the total number of unique variants now described to 252 (238 in exonic sequences and 14 at intronic splice junctions). Currently, a total of 586 individual reports with associated phenotypic data are available for searching by any category including phenotype. The FVIII structure section now includes a download of a FVIII A domain homology model in Protein Data Bank format and a multiple alignment of the FVIII amino-acid sequencies from four species (human, murine, porcine and canine) in addition to the virtual reality simulations, secondary structural data and FVIII animation already available. Finally, to aid navigation across this site, a clickable roadmap of the main features provides easy access to the page desired. Our intention is that continued development and updating of the site shall provide workers in the fields of molecular and structural biology with a one-stop resource site to facilitate FVIII research and education. The HAMSTeRS URL is http://www.europium.mrc.rpms.ac.uk
 We at the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) ( http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp ) have recently begun receiving, processing and releasing EST and genome sequence data submitted by various Japanese genome projects. The data include those for human, Arabidopsis thaliana , rice, nematode, Synechocystis sp . and Escherichia coli . Since the quantity of data is very large, we organized teams to conduct preliminary discussions with project teams about data submission and handling for release to the public. We also developed a mass submission tool to cope with a large quantity of data. In addition, to provide genome data on WWW, we developed a genome information system using Java. This system ( http://mol.genes.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/ ) can in theory be used for any genome sequence data. These activities will facilitate processing of large quantities of EST and genome data. 
 Sequences of 3279 sequences of tRNA genes and tRNAs published up to December 1996 are included in the compilation. Alignment of the sequences, which is most compatible with the tRNA phylogeny and known three-dimensional structures of tRNA, is used. Sequences and references are available under http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/departments/biochemie/trna/
PAHdb ( http://www.mcgill.ca/pahdb ) is a curated relational database ( Fig. 1 ) of nucleotide variation in the human PAH cDNA (GenBank U49897). Among 328 different mutations by state ( Fig. 2 ) the majority are rare mutations causing hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) (OMIM 261600), the remainder are polymorphic variants without apparent effect on phenotype. PAHdb modules contain mutations, polymorphic haplotypes, genotype-phenotype correlations, expression analysis, sources of information and the reference sequence; the database also contains pages of clinical information and data on three ENU mouse orthologues of human HPA. Only six different mutations account for 60% of human HPA chromosomes worldwide, mutations stratify by population and geographic region, and the Oriental and Caucasian mutation sets are different ( Fig. 3 ). PAHdb provides curated electronic publication and one third of its incoming reports are direct submissions. Each different mutation receives a systematic (nucleotide) name and a unique identifier (UID). Data are accessed both by a Newsletter and a search engine on the website; integrity of the database is ensured by keeping the curated template offline. There have been >6500 online interrogations of the website. 
 The SWISS-2DPAGE database ( http://www.expasy.ch/ch2d/ch2d-top.html ) consists of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis images, as well as textual descriptions of the proteins that have been identified on them. The current release contains 15 reference maps from human biological samples, as well as from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Escherichia coli and Dictyostelium discoideum origin. These reference maps have 2088 identified spots, corresponding to 410 separate protein entries in the database, in addition to virtual entries for each SWISS-PROT sequence. 
 The integrated X chromosome database (IXDB) is a repository for physical mapping data of the human X chromosome. Its current content is the result of a strict integration of data stemming from many different sources. The main features of IXDB include a flexible and extendible schema, a comfortable and fully crossreferenced WWW interface ( http://ixdb.mpimg-berlin-dahlem.mpg.de ) and a graphical map viewer implemented in JAVA. The database stores objects used in physical mapping as well as the maps resulting from this work, but a strong emphasis is placed on recording experiments that connect objects together. This should greatly contribute to fulfilling one of the major goals of the database: to support the construction of an integrated physical, genetic, transcript and sequence map of the human X chromosome. 
 Searches of the major public protein databases with core and linker chicken and human histone sequences have resulted in the compilation of an annotated set of histone protein sequences. In addition, new database searches with two distinct motif search algorithms have identified several members of the histone fold family, including human DRAP1 and yeast CSE4. Database resources include information on conflicts between similar sequence entries in different source databases, multiple sequence alignments, links to the Entrez integrated information retrieval system, structures for histone and histone fold proteins, and the ability to visualize structural data through Cn3D. The database currently contains >1000 protein sequences, which are searchable by protein type, accession number, organism name, or any other free text appearing in the definition line of the entry. All sequences and alignments in this database are available through the World Wide Web at http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/DIR/GTB/HISTONES or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Baxevani/HISTONES
 In 1997 the primary focus of the Genome Sequence DataBase (GSDB; www.ncgr.org/gsdb ) located at the National Center for Genome Resources was to improve data quality and accessibility. Efforts to increase the quality of data within the database included two major projects; one to identify and remove all vector contamination from sequences in the database and one to create premier sequence sets (including both alignments and discontiguous sequences). Data accessibility was improved during the course of the last year in several ways. First, a graphical database sequence viewer was made available to researchers. Second, an update process was implemented for the web-based query tool, Maestro. Third, a web-based tool, Excerpt, was developed to retrieve selected regions of any sequence in the database. And lastly, a GSDB flatfile that contains annotation unique to GSDB (e.g., sequence analysis and alignment data) was developed. Additionally, the GSDB web site provides a tool for the detection of matrix attachment regions (MARs), which can be used to identify regions of high coding potential. The ultimate goal of this work is to make GSDB a more useful resource for genomic comparison studies and gene level studies by improving data quality and by providing data access capabilities that are consistent with the needs of both types of studies. 
 The Blocks Database World Wide Web ( http://www.blocks.fhcrc.org ) and Email ( blocks@blocks.fhcrc.org ) servers provide tools for the detection and analysis of protein homology based on alignment blocks representing conserved regions of proteins. During the past year, searching has been augmented by supplementation of the Blocks Database with blocks from the Prints Database, for a total of 4754 blocks from 1163 families. Blocks from both the Blocks and Prints Databases and blocks that are constructed from sequences submitted to Block Maker can be used for blocks-versus-blocks searching of these databases with LAMA, and for viewing logos and bootstrap trees. Sensitive searches of up-to-date protein sequence databanks are carried out via direct links to the MAST server using position-specific scoring matrices and to the BLAST and PSI-BLAST servers using consensus-embedded sequence queries. Utilizing the trypsin family to evaluate performance, we illustrate the superiority of blocks-based tools over expert pairwise searching or Hidden Markov Models. 
 The non-redundant Bacillus subtilis database (NRSub) has been developed in the context of the sequencing project devoted to this bacterium. As this project has reached completion, the whole genome is now available as a single contig. Thanks to the ACNUC database management system and its associated retrieval system Query_win, each functional region of the genome can be accessed individually. Extra annotations have been added such as accession numbers for the genes, locations on the genetic map, codon adaptation index values, as well as cross-references with other collections. NRSub is distributed through anonymous FTP as a text file in EMBL format and as an ACNUC database. It is also possible to access NRSub through two dedicated World Wide Web servers located in France ( http://acnuc.univ-lyon1.fr/nrsub/nrsub.html ) and in Japan ( http://ddbjs4h.genes.nig.ac.jp/ ). 
 The SV40 T antigen database ( http://www.pitt.edu/~pipaslab/ ) lists viruses and plasmids expressing mutant forms of large T antigen. Each entry contains information regarding the mutant designation, mutant type, virus strain, nucleotide change, amino acid change and pertinent references. The database is now available as an internet searchable index. 
 O-GLYCBASE is a revised database of information on glycoproteins and their O-linked glycosylation sites. Entries are compiled and revised from the literature, and from the sequence databases. Entries include information about species, sequence, glycosylation sites and glycan type and is fully cross-referenced. Compared to version 2.0 the number of entries has increased by 20%. Sequence logos displaying the acceptor specificity patterns for the GalNAc, mannose and GlcNAc transferases are shown. The O-GLYCBASE database is available through the WWW at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/OGLYCBASE/
 MHCPEP ( http://wehih.wehi.edu.au/mhcpep/ ) is a curated database comprising over 13 000 peptide sequences known to bind MHC molecules. Entries are compiled from published reports as well as from direct submissions of experimental data. Each entry contains the peptide sequence, its MHC specificity and where available, experimental method, observed activity, binding affinity, source protein and anchor positions, as well as publication references. The present format of the database allows text string matching searches but can easily be converted for use in conjunction with sequence analysis packages. The database can be accessed via Internet using WWW or FTP. 
 We have continued to develop MITOMAP ( http://www.gen.emory.edu/MITOMAP ), a comprehensive database for the human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). MITOMAP uses the mtDNA sequence as the unifying element for bringing together information on mitochondrial genome structure and function, pathogenic mutations and their clinical characteristics, population associated variation, and gene-gene interactions. Over the past year we have increased the degree of interlinking of MITOMAP information available on the web page, by using our generalized information management system, GENOME. As increasingly larger regions of the human genome are sequenced and characterized, the need for integrating such information is growing. Consequently, MITOMAP and GENOME provide a valuable reference for the mitochondrial biologist, in addition to being a model for the development of comprehensive, information storage and retrieval systems for other components of the human genome. This paper documents the changes to MITOMAP which have been implemented over the past year. 
 In this paper, the current status of the Molecular Probe Data Base ( http://www.biotech.ist.unige.it/interlab/mpdb.html ) is briefly presented together with a short analysis of its activity during 1997. This has been performed by statistically evaluating the ‘logs’ of the Internet servers that are used for its distribution with reference to the geographical origin of the requests, the words that were utilized to carry out of the searches and the oligonucleotides that were retrieved. Planned enhancements of this database are also described. They include a revision of its data structure and, even more relevant, of its data management procedures. 
 HSSP ( http://www.sander.embl-ebi.ac.uk/hssp/ ) is a derived database merging structure (3-D) and sequence (1-D) information. For each protein of known 3D structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we provide a multiple sequence alignment of putative homologues and a sequence profile characteristic of the protein family, centered on the known structure. The list of homologues is the result of an iterative database search in SWISS-PROT using a position-weighted dynamic programming method for sequence profile alignment (MaxHom). The database is updated frequently. The listed putative homologues are very likely to have the same 3D structure as the PDB protein to which they have been aligned. As a result, the database not only provides aligned sequence families, but also implies secondary and tertiary structures covering 33% of all sequences in SWISS-PROT. 
 VHL is a tumor suppressor gene localized on chromosome 3p25–26. Mutations of the VHL gene were described at first in the heritable von Hippel-Lindau disease and in the sporadic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). More recently, VHL has also been shown to harbor mutations in mesothelioma and small cell lung carcinoma. To date more than 500 mutations have been identified. These mutations are mainly private with only one hot spot at codon 167 associated with pheochromocytoma. The germline mutations are essentially missense while somatic mutations include deletions, insertions and nonsense. To standardize the collection of these informations, facilitate the mutational analysis of the VHL gene and promote the genotype-phenotype analysis, a software package along with a computerized database have been created. The current database and the analysis software are accessible via the internet and world wide web interface at the URL: http://www.umd.necker.fr
 The viroid and viroid-like RNA database is a compilation of all natural sequences published in journals or available from the GenBank and EMBL nucleotide sequence libraries. Several information regarding these RNA species such as the position of their self-catalytic domains and the open reading frame of the human hepatitits delta virus are provided. The database also includes a determination of the likely ancestral sequence of most species and a prediction of the most stable secondary structures of these sequences. This online database is available on the World Wide Web ( http://www.callisto.si.usherb.ca/∼jpperra ). It should provide an excellent reference point for further phylogenetic and structure-function studies of these RNA species. 
 EpoDB is a database designed for the study of gene regulation during differentiation and development of vertebrate red blood cells. In building EpoDB, we have taken the in advance approach to the data integration problem: we have extracted data relevant to red blood cells from GenBank, SWISS-PROT, TRRD (transcriptional regulation data) and GERD (expression levels data) to create a single integrated, highly curated view. Tools have been developed to automate data extraction from online resources, cleanse data of errors, enter information manually from the primary literature, generate a uniform, canonical representation of information and maintain data currency. The database is organized around biological features, e.g., genes, rather than sequences, which are supported by a controlled and consistent vocabulary for gene names and gene family names. Beyond the standard database queries, the functionality of EpoDB includes the ability to extract features and subsequences, display sequences and features graphically using bioWidget viewers and integrated analysis tools. EpoDB may be accessed at: http://cbil.humgen.upenn.edu/epodb/
 Acetylcholinesterase belongs to a family of proteins, the α/β hydrolase fold family, whose constituents evolutionarily diverged from a common ancestor and share a similar structure of a central β sheet surrounded by α helices. These proteins fulfil a wide range of physiological functions (hydrolases, adhesion molecules, hormone precursors) [Krejci,E., Duval,N., Chatonnet,A., Vincens,P. and Massoulié,J. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 88, 6647–6651]. ESTHER (for est erases, α/β h ydrolase e nzymes and r elatives) is a database aimed at collecting in one information system, sequence data together with biological annotations and experimental biochemical results related to the structure-function analysis of the enzymes of the family. The major upgrade of the database comes from the use of a new database management system: aCHEdb which uses the ACeDB progam designed by Richard Durbin and Jean Thierry-Mieg. It can be found at http://www.ensam.inra.fr/cholinesterase
The WT1 gene, located at 11p13, encodes a zinc finger transcription factor involved in renal and gonadal development and in Wilms' tumor. Constitutional mutations of this gene have been described in most patients with Denys Drash syndrome (mesangial sclerosis associated with male pseudohermaphrodism and/or Wilms' tumor), but also in patients with genitourinary abnormalities and Wilms' tumor (WT) or presenting with only unilateral or bilateral WT. Moreover, ∼10% of Wilms' tumors carry WT1 mutations at the somatic level. To facilitate the genotype-phenotype correlation analyses, we have created a software package along with a computerized database of germline (70 entries) and somatic (28 entries) mutations reported in the literature.
 CUTG (codon usage tabulated from GenBank) is a comprehensive database for codon usage. The codon usage for each full-length protein gene has been calculated using the nucleotide sequence obtained from GenBank sequence database. The sum of the codon use of each organism has been also calculated. The data files can be obtained from anonymous ftp sites of DDBJ, DISC and EBI. The list of codonusage of genes in organisms was made searchableby name of organism through a web site http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/~nakamura/CUTG.html The compilation is synchronized with major release of GenBank. 
 The GenBank® sequence database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) incorporates DNA sequences from all available public sources, primarily through the direct submission of sequence data from individual laboratories and from large-scale sequencing projects. Most submitters use the BankIt (WWW) or Sequin programs to send their sequence data. Data exchange with the EMBL Data Library and the DNA Data Bank of Japan helps ensure comprehensive worldwide coverage. GenBank data is accessible through NCBI's integrated retrieval system, Entrez , which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome and protein structure information. MEDLINE® abstracts from published articles describing the sequences are also included as an additional source of biological annotation. Sequence similarity searching is offered through the BLAST series of database search programs. In addition to FTP, e-mail and server/client versions of Entrez and BLAST, NCBI offers a wide range of World Wide Web retrieval and analysis services of interest to biologists. 
 A new version of the compilation of higher plant mitochondrial tRNA genes ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/services.html ) has been obtained by means of the FastA program for similarity searching in nucleotide sequence Databases. This approach improves the previous collection, which was based on literature data analysis. The current compilation contains 158 sequences with an increase of 43 units. In this paper, some interesting features of the new entries are briefly presented. 
 The Ad5 E1A database is a listing of mutations affecting the early region 1A (E1A) proteins of human adenovirus type 5. The database contains the name of the mutation, the nucleic acid sequence changes, the resulting alterations in amino acid sequence and reference. Additional notes and references are provided on the effect of each mutation on E1A function. The database is contained within the Adenovirus 5 E1A page on the World Wide Web at: http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/2541/
 REBASE is a comprehensive database of information about restriction enzymes and their associated methylases, including their recognition and cleavage sites and their commercial availability. Also included is a listing of homing endonucleases. Information from REBASE is available via monthly electronic mailings as well as via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web. The REBASE web site, http://www.neb.com/rebase , is where we maintain a web page for every enzyme, reference and supplier. Additionally, there is a search facility, help and NEWS pages, and a complete description of our various services. Specialized files are available that can be used directly by many software packages. 
 We have compiled the DNA sequence data for Escherichia coli K12 available from the GenBank and EMBL data libraries and independently from the literature. We provide the most definitive version of the ECD Escherichia coli database now exclusively via the World Wide Web System ( http://susi.bio.uni-giessen.de/ecdc.html ). Our database encloses the completed genome sequence recently published by two competing groups and an assembled set of all elder sequences. The organisation of the database allows precise physical location of each individual gene or regulatory region, even taking into consideration discrepancies in nomenclature. The WWW program allows to the user to branch into the original EMBL and SWISS-PROT datafiles. A number of links to other WWW servers dealing with E.coli is provided. A FASTA and BLAST search may be performed online. Besides the WWW format a flat file version may be obtained via ftp. A number of discrepancies between the two systematic sequence determinations and/or the literature have not yet been resolved. However, our database may serve as a reference source for resolution and/or the assignment of strain difference. 
 Since July 1995, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) has maintained RHdb ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/RHdb/RHdb.html ), a public database for radiation hybrid data. Radiation hybrid mapping is an important technique for determining high resolution maps. Recently, CORBA access has been added to Rhdb. The EBI is an Outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). 
 The encyclopedia of Escherichia coli genes and metabolism (EcoCyc) is a database that combines information about the genome and the intermediary metabolism of E.coli . The database describes 3030 genes of E.coli , 695 enzymes encoded by a subset of these genes, 595 metabolic reactions that occur in E.coli , and the organization of these reactions into 123 metabolic pathways. The EcoCyc graphical user interface allows scientists to query and explore the EcoCyc database using visualization tools such as genomic-map browsers and automatic layouts of metabolic pathways. EcoCyc can be thought of as an electronic review article because of its copious references to the primary literature, and as a (qualitative) computational model of E.coli metabolism. EcoCyc is available at URL http://www.ecocyc.PangeaSystems.com/ecocyc/
 The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) represents a comprehensive core collection of data on published germline mutations in nuclear genes underlying human inherited disease. By September 1997, the database contained nearly 12 000 different lesions in a total of 636 different genes, with new entries currently accumulating at a rate of over 2000 per annum. Although originally established for the scientific study of mutational mechanisms in human genes, HGMD has acquired a much broader utility to researchers, physicians and genetic counsellors so that it was made publicly available at http://www.uwcm.ac.uk/uwcm/mg/hgmd0.html in April 1996. Mutation data in HGMD are accessible on the basis of every gene being allocated one web page per mutation type, if data of that type are present. Meaningful integration with phenotypic, structural and mapping information has been accomplished through bi-directional links between HGMD and both the Genome Database (GDB) and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Baltimore, USA. Hypertext links have also been established to Medline abstracts through Entrez , and to a collection of 458 reference cDNA sequences also used for data checking. Being both comprehensive and fully integrated into the existing bioinformatics structures relevant to human genetics, HGMD has established itself as the central core database of inherited human gene mutations. 
 The taxonomically broad organelle genome database (GOBASE) organizes and integrates diverse data related to organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts). The current version of GOBASE focuses on the mitochondrial subset of data and contains molecular sequences, RNA secondary structures and genetic maps, as well as taxonomic information for all eukaryotic species represented. The database has been designed so that complex biological queries, especially ones posed in a comparative genomics context, are supported. GOBASE has been implemented as a relational database with a web-based user interface ( http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/gobase/gobase.html ). Custom software tools have been written in house to assist in the population of the database, data validation, nomenclature standardization and front-end design. The database is fully operational and publicly accessible via the World Wide Web, allowing interactive browsing, sophisticated searching and easy downloading of data. 
 About 8600 complete or nearly complete sequences are now available from the Antwerp database on small ribosomal subunit RNA. All these sequences are aligned with one another on the basis of the adopted secondary structure model, which is corroborated by the observation of compensating substitutions in the alignment. Literature references, accession numbers and detailed taxonomic information are also compiled. The database can be consulted via the World Wide Web at URL http://rrna.uia.ac.be/ssu/
 The RNA modification database provides a comprehensive listing of posttranscriptionally modified nucleosides from RNA, and is maintained as an updated version of the initial printed report [Limbach,P.A., Crain,P.F. and McCloskey,J.A. (1994) Nucleic Acids Res. , 22, 2183–2196]. Information provided for each nucleoside includes: the type of RNA in which it occurs and phylogenetic distribution; common chemical name and symbol; Chemical Abstracts registry number and index name; chemical structure; initial literature citations for structural characterization or occurrence, and for chemical synthesis. The data are available through the World Wide Web at: http://www-medlib.med.utah.edu/RNAmods/RNAmods.html
 FlyBase ( http://www.flybase.bio.indiana.edu/ ) is a comprehensive database of genetic and molecular data concerning Drosophila . FlyBase is maintained as a relational database (in Sybase) and is made available as html documents and flat files. The scope of FlyBase includes: genes, alleles (with phenotypes), aberrations, transposons, pointers to sequence data, gene products, maps, clones, stock lists, Drosophila workers and bibliographic references. 
 TransTerm-97 contains more than 97 500 non-redundant coding-sequence initiation and termination contexts compiled from GenBank, release 101 (15-June-1997). In addition, several coding sequence parameters are available: coding sequence length, Nc, GC3, and, when it is computable, codon adaptation index (CAI). Codon usage tables and summaries of start and stop codon contexts are also included. The information covers more than 325 species and organelles, including seven complete bacterial genomes and one complete eukaryotic genome. To promote research in translational control of protein synthesis, TransTerm has been converted into a relational database to ease the process of making queries. The relational database manager, Postgresql, gives access to the database using SQL (Structured Query Language). A World Wide Web interface using forms is being completed to allow the casual user access to the database. Extensions are planned to include the full 5′-UTR, full coding sequence and 3′-UTR. TransTerm-97 is available on the World Wide Web at: http://biochem.otago.ac.nz:800/Transterm/homepage.html
 TRANSFAC, TRRD (Transcription Regulatory Region Database) and COMPEL are databases which store information about transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. The three databases provide distinct views on the components involved in transcription: transcription factors and their binding sites and binding profiles (TRANSFAC), the regulatory hierarchy of whole genes (TRRD), and the structural and functional properties of composite elements (COMPEL). The quantitative and qualitative changes of all three databases and connected programs are described. The databases are accessible via WWW: http://transfac.gbf.de/TRANSFAC or http://www.bionet.nsc.ru/TRRD
 The ProDom database contains protein domain families generated from the SWISS-PROT database by automated sequence comparisons. It can be searched on the World Wide Web ( http://protein.toulouse.inra.fr/ prodom.html ) or by E-mail ( prodom@toulouse.inra.fr ) to study domain arrangements within known families or new proteins. Strong emphasis has been put on the graphical user interface which allows for interactive analysis of protein homology relationships. Recent improvements to the server include: ProDom search by keyword; links to PROSITE and PDB entries; more sensitive ProDom similarity search with BLAST or WU-BLAST; alignments of query sequences with homologous ProDom domain families; and links to the SWISS-MODEL server ( http://www.expasy.ch/swissmod/ SWISS-MODEL.html ) for homology based 3-D domain modelling where possible. 
 PLACE ( http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/htdocs/PLACE/ ) is a database of motifs found in plant cis -acting regulatory DNA elements, all from previously published reports. It covers vascular plants only. In addition to the motifs originally reported, their variations in other genes or in other plant species reported later are also compiled. The PLACE database also contains a brief description of each motif and relevant literature with PubMed ID numbers. This report summarizes the present status of this database and available tools. 
 tmRNA (also known as 10Sa RNA) is so-named for its dual tRNA-like and mRNA-like nature. It is employed in a remarkable trans -translation process to add a C-terminal peptide tag to the incomplete protein product of a broken mRNA; the tag targets the abnormal protein for proteolysis. tmRNA sequences have been identified in genomes of diverse bacterial phyla, including the most deeply branching. They have also been identified in plastids of the ‘red’ lineage. The tmRNA Website ( http://www.wi.mit.edu/bartel/tmRNA/home ) contains a database currently including sequences from 37 species, with provisional alignments, as well as the tentatively predicted proteolysis tag sequences. A brief review and guide to the literature is also provided. 
 From its origin the Protein Information Resource ( http://www-nbrf.georgetown.edu/pir/ ) has supported research on evolution and computational biology by designing and compiling a comprehensive, quality controlled, and well-organized protein sequence database. The database has been produced and updated on a regular schedule since 1984. Since 1988 it has been maintained collaboratively by the PIR-International, an association of data collection centers engaged in international cooperation for the development of this research resource during a period of explosive acquisition of new data. As of June 1997, essentially all sequence entries have been classified into families, allowing the efficient application of methods to propagate and standardize annotation among related sequences. The databases are available through the Internet by the World-Wide Web and FTP, or on CD-ROM and magnetic media. 
 GIF-DB and FlyNets are two WWW databases describing molecular (protein-DNA, protein-RNA and protein-protein) interactions occuring in the fly Drosophila melanogaster ( http://gifts.univ-mrs.fr/GIFTS_home_page.html ). GIF-DB is a specialised database which focuses on molecular interactions involved in the process of embryonic pattern formation, whereas FlyNets is a new and more general database, the long-term goal of which is to report on any published molecular interaction occuring in the fly. The information content of both databases is distributed in specific lines arranged into an EMBL- (or GenBank-) like format. These databases achieve a high level of integration with other databases such as FlyBase, EMBL, GenBank and SWISS-PROT through numerous hyperlinks. In addition, we also describe SOS-DGDB, a new collection of annotated Drosophila gene sequences, in which binding sites for regulatory proteins are directly visible on the DNA primary sequence and hyperlinked both to GIF-DB and TRANSFAC database entries. 
 Pfam contains multiple alignments and hidden Markov model based profiles (HMM-profiles) of complete protein domains. The definition of domain boundaries, family members and alignment is done semi-automatically based on expert knowledge, sequence similarity, other protein family databases and the ability of HMM-profiles to correctly identify and align the members. Release 2.0 of Pfam contains 527 manually verified families which are available for browsing and on-line searching via the World Wide Web in the UK at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Pfam/ and in the US at http://genome.wustl.edu/Pfam/ Pfam 2.0 matches one or more domains in 50% of Swissprot-34 sequences, and 25% of a large sample of predicted proteins from the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. 
 The eighth edition of the haemophilia B database ( http://www.umds.ac.uk/molgen/haemBdatabase.htm ) lists in an easily accessible form all known factor IX mutations due to small changes (base substitutions and short additions and/or deletions of <30 bp) identified in haemophilia B patients. The 1713 patient entries are ordered by the nucleotide number of their mutation. Where known, details are given on: factor IX activity, factor IX antigen in circulation, presence of inhibitor and origin of mutation. References to published mutations are given and the laboratories generating the data are indicated. 
 The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) provides Internet access to the complete Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic sequence, its genes and their products, the phenotypes of its mutants, and the literature supporting these data. The amount of information and the number of features provided by SGD have increased greatly following the release of the S.cerevisiae genomic sequence, which is currently the only complete sequence of a eukaryotic genome. SGD aids researchers by providing not only basic information, but also tools such as sequence similarity searching that lead to detailed information about features of the genome and relationships between genes. SGD presents information using a variety of user-friendly, dynamically created graphical displays illustrating physical, genetic and sequence feature maps. SGD can be accessed via the World Wide Web at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/
 An update containing small RNA sequences published since our last compilation. Sequences from various sources covered in earlier compilations ( 1–8 ) are not included in this update 
 This database consists of over 24 000 mutations in 18 viral, bacterial, yeast or mammalian genes. The data are grouped as sets of DNA base sequence changes or spectra caused by a particular mutagen under defined conditions. The spectra are available on the World Wide Web at http://info.med.yale.edu/mutbase/ in two formats; in text format that can be browsed on-line or downloaded for use with a text editor and in dBASEIII format for use, after downloading, by relational database programs or by spreadsheets. Researchers are encouraged to submit DNA sequence changes to a suitable mutation database such as ours. A data entry program, MUTSIN, can be retrieved from this site. MUTSIN diagrams each mutation on the computer screen and alerts the user to any discrepancies. 
 In this paper we present the updated version of the compilation of 5S rRNA and 5S rDNA nucleotide sequences. It contains 1622 primary structures of 5S rRNAs and 5S rRNA genes from 888 species. These include 58 archaeal, 427 eubacterial, 34 plastid, nine mitochondrial and 1094 eukaryotic DNA or RNA nucleotide sequences. The sequence entries are divided according to the taxonomic position of the organisms. All individual sequences deposited in the 5S rRNA Database can be retrieved using the WWW-based, taxonomic browser at http:www.//rose.man.poznan.pl/5SData/5SRNA.html or http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/fb_chemie/agerdmann/5S_rRNA.html . The files with complete sets of data as well as sequence alignments are available via anonymous ftp. 
 PhosphoBase is a database of experimentally verified phosphorylation sites. Version 1.0 contains 156 entries and 398 experimentally determined phosphorylation sites. Entries are compiled and revised from the literature and from major protein sequence databases such as SwissProt and PIR. The entries provide information about the phosphoprotein and the exact position of its phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, part of the entries contain information about kinetic data obtained from enzyme assays on specific peptides. To illustrate the use of data extracted from PhosphoBase we present a sequence logo displaying the overall conservation of positions around serines phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA). PhosphoBase is available on the WWW at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/PhosphoBase/
 A database ( http://perso.curie.fr/tsoussi ) is described, in which over 1000 mutations in the human APC gene of tumors (colon cancer predominantly) are compiled from the literature. It includes both molecular information about the mutations and clinical data about the patients. Software has been designed to analyse all this information in the database. 
 The rRNA WWW Server at URL http://www.rrna.uia.ac.be/ now provides a database of 496 large subunit ribosomal RNA sequences. All these sequences are aligned, incorporate secondary structure information, and can be obtained in a number of formats. Other information about the sequences, such as literature references, accession numbers and taxonomic information is also available and searchable. If necessary, the data on the server can also be obtained by anonymous ftp. 
 The collagens are a large and diverse family of proteins which are found in the extracellular matrix. In common with one another, the 19 known collagen types have triple-helical domains of variable length but they differ with respect to their overall size and the nature and location of their globular domains. Collagen mutations lead to heritable defects of connective tissues and mutation data for collagen types I and III are presented here. The mutation data are accessible on the world wide web at http://www.le.ac.uk/genetics/collagen/
 The FSSP database and its new supplement, the Dali Domain Dictionary, present a continuously updated classification of all known 3D protein structures. The classification is derived using an automatic structure alignment program (Dali) for the all-against-all comparison of structures in the Protein Data Bank. From the resulting enumeration of structural neighbours (which form a surprisingly continuous distribution in fold space) we derive a discrete fold classification in three steps: (i) sequence-related families are covered by a representative set of protein chains; (ii) protein chains are decomposed into structural domains based on the recurrence of structural motifs; (iii) folds are defined as tight clusters of domains in fold space. The fold classification, domain definitions and test sets for sequence-structure alignment (threading) are accessible on the web at www.embl-ebi.ac.uk/dali . The web interface provides a rich network of links between neighbours in fold space, between domains and proteins, and between structures and sequences leading, for example, to a database of explicit multiple alignments of protein families in the twilight zone of sequence similarity. The Dali/FSSP organization of protein structures provides a map of the currently known regions of the protein universe that is useful for the analysis of folding principles, for the evolutionary unification of protein families and for maximizing the information return from experimental structure determination. 
 The Yeast Protein Database (YPD) is a curated database for the proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . It consists of ∼6000 Yeast Protein Reports, one for each of the known or predicted yeast proteins. Each Yeast Protein Report is a one-page presentation of protein properties, annotation lines that summarize findings from the literature, and references. In the past year, the number of annotation lines has grown from 25 000 to ∼35 000, and the number of articles curated has grown from ∼3500 to >5000. Recently, new data types have been included in YPD: protein-protein interactions, genetic interactions, and regulators of gene expression. Finally, a new layer of information, the YPD Protein Minireviews, has recently been introduced. The Yeast Protein Database can be found on the Web at http://www.proteome.com/YPDhome.html
 Since 1989, about 570 different p53 mutations have been identified in more than 8000 human cancers. A database of these mutations was initiated by M. Hollstein and C. C. Harris in 1990. This database originally consisted of a list of somatic point mutations in the p 53 gene of human tumors and cell lines, compiled from the published literature and made available in a standard electronic form. The database is maintained at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and updated versions are released twice a year (January and July). The current version (July 1997) contains records on 6800 published mutations and will surpass the 8000 mark in the January 1998 release. The database now contains information on somatic and germline mutations in a new format to facilitate data retrieval. In addition, new tools are constructed to improve data analysis, such as a Mutation Viewer Java applet developed at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) to visualise the location and impact of mutations on p53 protein structure. The database is available in different electronic formats at IARC ( http://www.iarc.fr/p53/homepage.htm ) or from the EBI server ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk ). The IARC p53 website also provides reports on database analysis and links with other p53 sites as well as with related databases. In this report, we describe the criteria for inclusion of data, the revised format and the new visualisation tools. We also briefly discuss the relevance of p 53 mutations to clinical and biological questions. 
 MitBASE is a comprehensive and integrated mitochondrial genome database funded within the EU BIOTECH PROGRAM. It is a project for the development and implementation of an integrated and comprehensive database of mitochondrial data which will collect all available information from different organisms and from intraspecies variants and mutants. The present paper describes the structure of the Human dataset in mit-BASE where human molecular data are distinguished from clinical and pathological data. MitBASE home page address is: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/htbin/Mitbase/mitbase.pl
 Database interconnection requires the development of links between related objects from different databases. We built a database of links, called Virgil, to manage and distribute rich (documented) links between GDB genes and GenBank human sequences. Virgil contains 18 667 unique links. In addition to a simple Web form for ad-hoc queries, we propose a generic Web interface and a prototype CORBA server for link distribution. Materials described in this paper are available from http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/virgil/home.html
 The Marfan database is a software that contains routines for the analysis of mutations identified in the FBN1 gene that encodes fibrillin-1. Mutations in this gene are associated not only with Marfan syndrome but also with a spectrum of overlapping disorders. The third version of the Marfan database contains 137 entries. The software has been modified to accommodate four new routines and is now accessible on the World Wide Web at http://www.umd.necker.fr
 The present paper describes the improvements in MmtDB, a specialised database designed to collect Metazoa mitochondrial DNA variants. Priority in the data collection has been given to Metazoa for which a large amount of variants is available, e.g., for humans. Starting from the sequences available in the Nucleotide Sequence Databases, the redundant sequences have been removed and new sequences from other sources have been added. Value-added information is associated to each variant sequence, e.g., analysed region, experimental method, tissue and cell lines, population data, sex, age, family code and information about the variation events (nucleotide position, involved gene, restriction site gain or loss). Cross-references are introduced to the EMBL Data Library, as well as an internal cross-referencing among MmtDB entries according to tissual, heteroplasmic, familiar and aplotypical correlation. Furthermore MmtDB has a new section, AMmtDB: Aligned Metazoan mitochondrial biosequences. MmtDB can be accessed through the World Wide Web at URL http://WWW.ba.cnr.it/∼areamt08/MmtDBWWW.htm
 We have created databases and software applications for the analysis of DNA mutations at the human p53 gene, the human hprt gene and both the rodent transgenic lacI and lacZ loci. The databases themselves are stand-alone dBASE files and the software for analysis of the databases runs on IBM-compatible computers with Microsoft Windows. Each database has a separate software analysis program. The software created for these databases permit the filtering, ordering, report generation and display of information in the database. In addition, a significant number of routines have been developed for the analysis of single base substitutions. One method of obtaining the databases and software is via the World Wide Web. Open the following home page with a Web Browser: http://sunsite.unc.edu/dnam/mainpage.html . Alternatively, the databases and programs are available via public FTP from: ftp://www.anonymous@sunsite.unc.edu . There is no password required to enter the system. The databases and software are found beneath the subdirectory: pub/academic/biology/dna-mutations. Two other programs are available at the site, a program for comparison of mutational spectra and a program for entry of mutational data into a relational database. 
 The MIPS group [Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences of the German National Center for Environment and Health (GSF)] at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried near Munich, Germany, is involved in a number of data collection activities, including a comprehensive database of the yeast genome, a database reflecting the progress in sequencing the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, the systematic analysis of other small genomes and the collection of protein sequence data within the framework of the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database (described elsewhere in this volume). Through its WWW server ( http://www.mips.biochem.mpg.de ) MIPS provides access to a variety of generic databases, including a database of protein families as well as automatically generated data by the systematic application of sequence analysis algorithms. The yeast genome sequence and its related information was also compiled on CD-ROM to provide dynamic interactive access to the 16 chromosomes of the first eukaryotic genome unraveled. 
 This release of the SRPDB (signal recognition particle database, http://pegasus.uthct.edu/SRPDB/SRPDB.html ) adds four SRP RNA sequences (a total of 99 SRP RNA sequences), 23 SRP protein sequences (a total of 63 protein sequences from SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP21, SRP54, SRP68 or SRP72), and, for the first time, sequences of the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic SRP receptor and its homologous bacterial proteins (a total of 21 sequences). Sequences are offered phylogenetically ordered, annotated with links to the primary databases, and in aligned form. Also downloadable are sample SRP RNA secondary structure diagrams, three-dimensional models of representative SRP RNAs, and search motifs. 
 Mutations in the LDL receptor gene (LDLR) cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a common autosomal dominant disorder. The LDLR database is a computerized tool that has been developed to provide tools to analyse the numerous mutations that have been identified in the LDLR gene. The second version of the LDLR database contains 140 new entries and the software has been modified to accommodate four new routines. The analysis of the updated data (350 mutations) gives the following informations: (i) 63% of the mutations are missense, and only 20% occur in CpG dinucleotides; (ii) although the mutations are widely distributed throughout the gene, there is an excess of mutations in exons 4 and 9, and a deficit in exons 13 and 15; (iii) the analysis of the distribution of mutations located within the ligand-binding domain shows that 74% of the mutations in this domain affect a conserved amino-acid, and that they are mostly confined in the C-terminal region of the repeats. Conversely, the same analysis in the EGF-like domain shows that 64% of the mutations in this domain affect a non-conserved amino-acid, and, that they are mostly confined in the N-terminal half of the repeats. The database is now accessible on the World Wide Web at http://www.umd.necker.fr
 The PROMISE ( Pro sthetic centres and m etal i ons in protein active s it e s) database aims to gather together comprehensive sequence, structural, functional and bibliographic information on proteins which possess prosthetic centres, with an emphasis on active site structure and function. The database is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.bioinf.leeds.ac.uk/promise/
 ooTFD (object-oriented Transcription Factors Database) is a successor to TFD (Transcription Factors Database). ooTFD contains information represented in TFD but also allows the representation of containment, composite, and interaction relationships between transcription factor polypeptides. ooTFD is designed to represent information about all transcription factors, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, basal as well as regulatory factors, and multiprotein complexes as well as monomers. ooTFD and associated tools and services can be accessed at http://www.isbi.net/
 The Metabolic Pathways Database (MPW) ( http://www.biobase.com/emphome.html/homepage.html/pags/pathways.html ) a derivative of EMP ( http://www.biobase.com/EMP ) plays a fundamental role in the technology of metabolic reconstructions from sequenced genomes under the PUMA ( http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/compbio/PUMA/Production/ReconstructedMetabolism/reconstruction.html ), WIT ( http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/compbio/WIT/wit.html ) and WIT2 ( http://www.beauty.isdn.mcs.anl.gov/WIT2.pub/CGI/user.cgi ) systems. In October 1997, it included some 2800 pathway diagrams covering primary and secondary metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction pathways, intracellular traffic, translation and transcription. In the current public release of MPW ( http://www/beauty.isdn.mcs.anl.gov/MPW ), the encoding is based on the logical structure of the pathways and is represented by the objects commonly used in electronic circuit design. This facilitates drawing and editing the diagrams and makes possible automation of the basic simulation operations such as deriving stoichiometric matrices, rate laws, and, ultimately, dynamic models of metabolic pathways. Individual pathway diagrams, automatically derived from the original ASCII records, are stored as SGML instances supplemented by relational indices. An auxiliary database of compound names and structures, encoded in the SMILES format, is maintained to unambiguously connect the pathways to the chemical structures of their intermediates. 
 RegulonDB is a DataBase that integrates biological knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate the transcription initiation in Escherichia coli , as well as knowledge on the organization of the genes and regulatory signals into operons in the chromosome. The operon is the basic structure used in RegulonDB to describe the elements and properties of transcriptional regulation. The current version contains information around some 500 regulation mechanisms, essentially for sigma 70 promoters. 
 Expanded versions of the Ribosomal RNA Mutation Databases provide lists of mutated positions in 16S and 16S-like ribosomal RNA (16SMDBexp) and 23S and 23S-like ribosomal RNA (23SMDBexp) and the identity of each alteration. Alterations from organisms other than Escherichia coli are reported at positions according to the E.coli numbering system. Information provided for each mutation includes: (i) a brief description of the phenotype(s) associated with each mutation, (ii) whether a mutant phenotype has been detected by in vivo or in vitro methods, and (iii) relevant literature citations. The databases are available via ftp and on the World Wide Web at the following URL: http://www.fandm.edu/Departments/Biology/Databases/RNA.html
 We created a comprehensive database covering all published cases of germline p53 mutations. The current version lists 580 tumours in 448 individuals belonging to 122 independent pedigrees. The database describes each p53 mutation (type of the mutation, exon and codon affected by the mutation, nucleotide and amino acid change), each family (family history of cancer, diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome), each affected individual (sex, generation, p53 status, from which parent the mutation was inherited) and each tumour (type, age of onset, p53 status—loss of heterozygosity, immunostaining). Each entry contains the original reference(s). The database is freely available and can be obtained from http://www.lf2.cuni.cz
 Ribonuclease P is responsible for the 5′-maturation of tRNA precursors. Ribonuclease P is a ribonucleoprotein, and in bacteria the RNA subunit alone is catalytically active in vitro , i.e., it is a ribozyme. The Ribonuclease P Database is a compilation of ribonuclease P sequences, sequence alignments, secondary structures, three-dimensional models and accessory information, available via the World Wide Web ( http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/RNaseP/home.html ). 
 SWISS-PROT ( http://www.expasy.ch/ ) is a curated protein sequence database which strives to provide a high level of annotations (such as the description of the function of a protein, its domains structure, post-translational modifications, variants, etc.), a minimal level of redundancy and high level of integration with other databases. Recent developments of the database include: an increase in the number and scope of model organisms; cross-references to two additional databases; a variety of new documentation files and improvements to TrEMBL, a computer annotated supplement to SWISS-PROT. TrEMBL consists of entries in SWISS-PROT-like format derived from the translation of all coding sequences (CDS) in the EMBL nucleotide sequence database, except the CDS already included in SWISS-PROT. 
 AtDB, the Arabidopsis thaliana Database, has a primary role to provide public access to the collected genomic information for A.thaliana via the World Wide Web (URL: http://genome-www.stanford.edu/ ). AtDB presents interactive physical and genetics maps that are hyperlinked with detailed information about the clones and markers placed on these maps. A large literature collection on Arabidopsis , contact information on researchers worldwide, laboratory method manuals and other information useful to plant molecular biologists are also provided. This paper discusses the database-driven clickable displays that provide easy navigation within a variety of genomic maps, including those summarizing progress of the international Arabidopsis genomic sequencing effort, AGI (the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative). The interface uses client-side hyperlinked GIF-images that direct the user to detailed database-information. A new BLAST service is also described. This gives users access to the thousands of Arabidopsis BAC clone end-sequences and includes hyperlinked images summarizing the search results. The linking of genetic and physically mapped regions and their sequence into information for loci within that region is an ongoing goal for this project. 
 The GPCRDB is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) database system aimed at the collection and dissemination of GPCR related data. It holds sequences, mutant data and ligand binding constants as primary (experimental) data. Computationally derived data such as multiple sequence alignments, three dimensional models, phylogenetic trees and two dimensional visualization tools are added to enhance the database's usefulness. The GPCRDB is an EU sponsored project aimed at building a generic molecular class specific database capable of dealing with highly heterogeneous data. GPCRs were chosen as test molecules because of their enormous importance for medical sciences and due to the availability of so much highly heterogeneous data. The GPCRDB is available via the WWW at http://www.gpcr.org/7tm
 The current version of the androgen receptor (AR) gene mutations database is described. The total number of reported mutations has risen from 272 to 309 in the past year. We have expanded the database: (i) by giving each entry an accession number; (ii) by adding information on the length of polymorphic polyglutamine (polyGln) and polyglycine (polyGly) tracts in exon 1; (iii) by adding information on large gene deletions; (iv) by providing a direct link with a completely searchable database (courtesy EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute). The addition of the exon 1 polymorphisms is discussed in light of their possible relevance as markers for predisposition to prostate or breast cancer. The database is also available on the internet ( http://www.mcgill.ca/androgendb/ ), from EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute ( ftp://www.ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/androgen ), or as a Macintosh FilemakerPro or Word file ( MC33@musica.mcgill.ca ). 
 This first release of the tmRNA database (tmRDB) contains 19 tmRNA sequences, a tmRNA sequence alignment with emphasis of base pairs that are supported by comparative sequence analysis, and a tabulation of tmRNA-encoded tag peptides. The tmRNADB also offers an RNA secondary structure diagram of the Escherichia coli tmRNA, as well as PDB-formatted coordinates for three-dimensional modeling. The data are available on the World Wide Web at http://www.uthct.edu/tmRDB/tmRDB.html
 Uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing is a post-transcriptional RNA modification occurring in the mitochondria of kinetoplastid protozoa. The U-insertion/deletion Edited Sequence Database is a compilation of mitochondrial genes and edited mRNAs from five kinetoplastid species. It contains separate files with the DNA, mRNA (both unedited and edited) and predicted protein sequences, as well as alignments of the Leishmania tarentolae and Trypanosoma brucei protein sequences from edited and unedited genes. The sequence files are in GCG format. A ‘map’ sequence file showing the location of U-deletions, U-insertions and the translated amino acid sequences is also provided for each gene. Genomic maps for each species are also provided with clickable genes, including maxicircle-encoded gRNAs. Sets of aligned nuclear rRNA sequences from kinetoplastid protozoa are also provided, which were used for phylogenetic reconstructions in an analysis of the origin of RNA editing. The database is available through the World Wide Web as an HTML document at the URL http://www.lifesci.ucla.edu/RNA/trypanosome/database.html
 The Human PAX6 Mutation Database contains details of 94 mutations of the PAX6 gene. A Microsoft Access program is used by the Curator to store, update and search the database entries. Mutations can be entered directly by the Curator, or imported from submissions made via the World Wide Web. The PAX6 Mutation Database web page at URL http://www.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/Softdata/PAX6/ provides information about PAX6, as well as a fill-in form through which new mutations can be submitted to the Curator. A search facility allows remote users to query the database. A plain text format file of the data can be downloaded via the World Wide Web. The Curation program contains prior knowledge of the genetic code and of the PAX6 gene including cDNA sequence, location of intron/exon boundaries, and protein domains, so that the minimum of information need be provided by the submitter or Curator. 
 CyanoBase ( http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/ ) is a database containing genomic information on the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. It furnishes an annotation to each of the 3168 protein genes deduced from the entire nucleotide sequence of this genome. Information on the genome can be directly accessed through three different menus: a clickable physical map of the genome, a gene classification list, and a keyword search menu, all of which are accessible from the main page of the database. The entry page for a gene annotation contains the following information: the location of the gene on the genome, the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the gene, the result of a similarity search, and the classification of the deduced gene product according to its function. This page has reverse-links to the local physical map and gene classification list so that relevant genes can be searched in terms of their location on the genome and their function. In addition, the main page of CyanoBase provides engines for similarity searches between a query sequence and the entire genome sequence and for keyword searches, in addition to numerous links to pages containing related information. 
 This paper describes the organisation of a database for human mitochondrial control-region sequences. The data are divided into three ASCII files that contain aligned sequences from the hypervariable region I (HVRI), from the hypervariable region II (HVRII), and the available information about the individuals, from whom the sequences stem. The current collection comprises 4079 HVRI and 969 HVRII sequences. From 728 individuals sequences of both HVRI and HVRII are available. For easy access, the collection is made available to the scientific community via World Wide Web at URL http://www.zi.biologie.uni-muenchen.de/~meyers/mtdna.html
 The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl.html ) constitutes Europe's primary nucleotide sequence resource. DNA and RNA sequences are directly submitted from researchers and genome sequencing groups and collected from the scientific literature and patent applications ( Fig. 1 ). In collaboration with DDBJ and GenBank the database is produced, maintained and distributed at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Database releases are produced quarterly and are distributed on CD-ROM. EBI's network services allow access to the most up-to-date data collection via Internet and World Wide Web interface, providing database searching and sequence similarity facilities plus access to a large number of additional databases. 
 The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) is a comprehensive community database that integrates genetic, genomic and phenotypic information about the laboratory mouse. MGD provides detailed information about genes and genetic markers, elemental data from mapping experiments, descriptions of molecular segments including ESTs, probes, and cDNA clones, homology information between mouse and many other mammalian genomes, and phenotypic descriptions of gene mutations, gene function and mouse strains. All data are supported by citations. Interactive graphical displays of cytogenetic, genetic and physical maps are available. User support is provided through dedicated staff, bulletin boards, and user documentation. MGD can be accessed at http://www.informatics.jax.org
 We have constructed a non-homologous database, termed the Integrated Sequence-Structure Database (ISSD) which comprises the coding sequences of genes, amino acid sequences of the corresponding proteins, their secondary structure and φ,ψ angles assignments, and polypeptide backbone coordinates. Each protein entry in the database holds the alignment of nucleotide sequence, amino acid sequence and the PDB three-dimensional structure data. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences for each entry are selected on the basis of exact matches of the source organism and cell environment. The current version 1.0 of ISSD is available on the WWW at http://www.protein.bio.msu.su/issd/ and includes 107 non-homologous mammalian proteins, of which 80 are human proteins. The database has been used by us for the analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in mRNA sequences showing their correlation with the three-dimensional structure features in the encoded proteins. Possible ISSD applications include optimisation of protein expression, improvement of the protein structure prediction accuracy, and analysis of evolutionary aspects of the nucleotide sequence-protein structure relationship. 
 The important role the untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs may play in gene regulation and expression is now widely acknowledged. For this reason we developed UTRdb, a specialized database of 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs cleaned from redundancy. UTRdb entries are enriched with specialized information not present in the primary databases, including the presence of functional patterns already demonstrated by experimental analysis to have some functional role. A collection of such patterns is being collected in UTRsite database ( http://bio-www.ba.cnr.it:8000/srs5/ ) which can also be used with appropriate computational tools to detect known functional patterns contained in mRNA untranslated regions. 
 X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is an immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the gene coding for Bruton's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (BTK). A database (BTKbase) of BTK mutations has been compiled and the recent update lists 463 mutation entries from 406 unrelated families showing 303 unique molecular events. In addition to mutations, the database also lists variants or polymorphisms. Each patient is given a unique patient identity number (PIN). Information is included regarding the phenotype including symptoms. Mutations in all the five domains of BTK have been noticed to cause the disease, the most common event being missense mutations. The mutations appear almost uniformly throughout the molecule and frequently affect CpG sites that code for arginine residues. The putative structural implications of all the missense mutations are given in the database. The improved version of the registry having a number of new features is available at http://www.helsinki.fi/science/signal/btkbase.html
 GenProtEC is a database of Escherichia coli genes and their gene products, classified by type of function and physiological role and with citations to the literature for each. Also present are data on sequence similarities among E.coli proteins, representing groups of paralogous genes, with PAM values, percent identity of amino acids, length of alignment and percent aligned. GenProtEC can be accessed at the URL http://www.mbl.edu/html/ecoli.html
 Last year, the original Glucocorticoid Receptor Resource expanded into a comprehensive project: the Nuclear Receptor Resource (NRR, http://nrr.georgetown.edu/nrr/nrr.html ). The NRR has since been offering comprehensive information on nuclear receptor structure and function, as well as general facts of interest to the scientific community on meetings, funding and employment opportunities. The project now includes individual resources as part of a network which integrates information on glucocorticoid, androgen, mineralocorticoid, thyroid hormone, Vitamin D and peroxisome-proliferator activated receptors. Many investigators have joined the NRR network by filling out the Who is who? form available in the NRR home page. This has facilitated communication among scientists in the field and dissemination of data not otherwise published. Because several investigators have contacted NRR authors over the past few months asking for advice and materials for educational purposes, we have recently decided to include in our project an educational resource on nuclear receptors termed the ‘Graphics Library’. The input and suggestions of NRR users do shape the future direction of the project, so we encourage users to continue to give us feedback. 
 The HuGeMap database stores the major genetic and physical maps of the human genome. It is also interconnected with the gene radiation hybrid mapping database RHdb. HuGeMap is accessible through a Web server for interactive browsing at URL http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/Hugemap , as well as through a CORBA server for effective programming. HuGeMap is intended as an attempt to build open, interconnected databases, that is databases that distribute their objects worldwide in compliance with a recognized standard of distribution. Maps can be displayed and compared with a java applet ( http://babbage.infobiogen.fr:15000/Mappet/MappetShow.html ) that queries the HuGeMap ORB server as well as the RHdb ORB server at the EBI. 
 IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics database, is an integrated database specialising in Immunoglobulins (Ig), T cell Receptors (TcR) and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) of all vertebrate species, created by Marie-Paule Lefranc, CNRS, Montpellier II University, Montpellier, France ( lefranc@ligm.crbm.cnrs-mop.fr ). IMGT includes three databases: LIGM-DB (for Ig and TcR), MHC/HLA-DB and PRIMER-DB (the last two in development). IMGT comprises expertly annotated sequences and alignment tables. LIGM-DB contains more than 23 000 Immunoglobulin and T cell Receptor sequences from 78 species. MHC/HLA-DB contains Class I and Class II Human Leucocyte Antigen alignment tables. An IMGT tool, DNAPLOT, developed for Ig, TcR and MHC sequence alignments, is also available. IMGT works in close collaboration with the EMBL database. IMGT goals are to establish a common data access to all immunogenetics data, including nucleotide and protein sequences, oligonucleotide primers, gene maps and other genetic data of Ig, TcR and MHC molecules, and to provide a graphical user friendly data access. IMGT has important implications in medical research (repertoire in autoimmune diseases, AIDS, leukemias, lymphomas), therapeutical approaches (antibody engineering), genome diversity and genome evolution studies. IMGT is freely available at http://imgt.cnusc.fr:8104
Dali and HSSP are derived databases organizing protein space in the structurally known regions. We use an automatic structure alignment program (Dali) for the classification of all known 3D structures based on all-against-all comparison of 3D structures in the Protein Data Bank. The HSSP database associates 1D sequences with known 3D structures using a position-weighted dynamic programming method for sequence profile alignment (MaxHom). As a result, the HSSP database not only provides aligned sequence families, but also implies secondary and tertiary structures covering 36% of all sequences in Swiss-Prot. The structure classification by Dali and the sequence families in HSSP can be browsed jointly from a web interface providing a rich network of links between neighbours in fold space, between domains and proteins, and between structures and sequences. In particular, this results in a database of explicit multiple alignments of protein families in the twilight zone of sequence similarity. The organization of protein structures and families provides a map of the currently known regions of the protein universe that is useful for the analysis of folding principles, for the evolutionary unification of protein families and for maximizing the information return from experimental structure determination. The databases are available from http://www.embl-ebi.ac.uk/dali/
A database of alternatively spliced genes (ASDB) has been constructed based on (i) the results of the analysis of Swiss-Prot entries containing products of these genes and (ii) clustering procedure joining proteins that could arise by alternative splicing of the same gene. ASDB incorporates information about alternatively spliced genes, their products and expression patterns. It can be searched in order to find all products of alternative splicing produced in a particular tissue or a given organism, or all variants generated by a particular transcript. ASDB currently contains about 1700 protein sequences and can be accessed via the Internet at URL http://cbcg.nersc.gov/asdb
The database provides an online resource for access to data on the genetics of asthma and allergy. This report describes the present status of the site. Currently, a detailed description of 88 linkage studies (7164 linkage positions) and 72 mutation studies are available. The results can be accessed in table form or graphically. The database also contains mouse asthma studies and human homology relationships, gene expression studies and links to relevant patents. Technical details about the server architecture, database installation, database construction, database structure and the user interface are explained elsewhere [Wjst and Immervoll (1998) Bioinformatics, 14, 827–828]. The URL is http://cooke.gsf.de
The ligand gated ion channels (LGICs) are ionotropic receptors to neurotransmitters. Their physiological effect is carried out by the opening of an ionic channel upon binding of a particular neurotransmitter. these LGICs constitute superfamilies of receptors formed by homologous subunits. A database has been developed to handle the growing wealth of cloned subunits. This database contains nucleic acid sequences, protein sequences, as well as multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic studies. This database is accessible via the worldwide web (http://www.pasteur.fr/units/neubiomol/LGIC.html), where it is continuously updated. A downloadable version is also available [currently v0.1 (98.06)].
SMART is a simple modular architecture research tool and database that provides domain identification and annotation on the WWW (http://coot.embl-heidelberg.de/SMART). The tool compares query sequences with its databases of domain sequences and multiple alignments whilst concurrently identifying compositionally biased regions such as signal peptide, transmembrane and coiled coil segments. Annotated and unannotated regions of the sequence can be used as queries in searches of sequence databases. The SMART alignment collection represents more than 250 signalling and extracellular domains. Each alignment is curated to assign appropriate domain boundaries and to ensure its quality. In addition, each domain is annotated extensively with respect to cellular localisation, species distribution, functional class, tertiary structure and functionally important residues.
Two more organisms from different taxonomic groups were added to a new version of the integrated Sequence-Structure Database (ISSD). ISSD serves as an integrated source of sequence and structure information for the analysis of correlations between mRNA synonymous codon usage and threedimensional structure of the encoded proteins. ISSD now holds 88 non-homologous Escherichia coli proteins and 25 yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins in addition to the expanded set of mammalian proteins, which includes 166 proteins (107 in ISSD Version 1.0). Comparison of ISSD sequences with organism-specific codon usage data derived from CUTG database shows that it is a representative subset of the genbank coding sequences data. Preliminary results of the statistical analysis confirm that sequence-structure correlations observed by us earlier are also present in the upgraded ISSD (Version 2.0), including bacterial and yeast proteins. The ISSD version 2.0 release includes an improved web-based data search and retrieval system and is accessible via URL http://www.protein.bio.msu.su/issd/. ISSD can be also accessed at ExPASy, URL http://www.expasy.ch/swissmod/swiss-model.html
INFOGENE is a database of known and predicted gene structures with descriptions of basic functional signals and gene components. It provides a possibility to create compilations of sequences with a given gene feature as well as to accumulate and analyze predicted genes in finished and unfinished sequences from genome sequencing projects. Protein sequence similarity searches in the database of predicted proteins is offered through the BLASTP program. INFOGENE is realized under the Sequence Retrieval System that provides useful links with the other informational databases. The database is available through the WWW server of the Computational Genomics Group at http://genomic.sanger.ac.uk/db.html
Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in cleavage of rRNA, modification of rRNA nucleotides and, perhaps, other aspects of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. Scores of snoRNAs have been discovered in recent years from various eukaryotes, and the total number is predicted to be up to 200 different snoRNA species per individual organism. We have created a comprehensive database for snoRNAs from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which allows easy access to detailed information about each species known (almost 70 snoRNAs are featured). The database consists of three major parts: (i) a utilities section; (ii) a master table; and (iii) a collection of tables for the individual snoRNAs. The utilities section provides an introduction to the database. The master table lists all known s.cerevisiae snoRNAs and their major properties. Information in the individual tables includes: alternate names, size, family classification, genomic organization, sequences (with major features identified), GenBank accession numbers, occurrence of homologues, gene disruption phenotypes, functional properties and associated RNAs and proteins. All information is accompanied with appropriate literature references. The database is available on the World Wide Web (http://www.bio.umass.edu/biochem/rna-sequence/Yeast_snoRNA_Database/snoRNA_DataBase.html), and should be useful for a wide range of snoRNA studies.
IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics database (http://imgt.cnusc.fr:8104), is a high-quality integrated database specialising in Immunoglobulins (Ig), T cell Receptors (TcR) and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules of all vertebrate species, created in 1989 by Marie-Paule Lefranc, Université Montpellier II, CNRS, Montpellier, France (lefranc@ligm.igh.cnrs.fr). IMGT comprises three databases: LIGM-DB, a comprehensive database of Ig and TcR, MHC/HLA-DB, and PRIMER-DB (the last two in development); a tool, IMGT/DNAPLOT, developed for sequence analysis and alignments; and expertised data based on the IMGT scientific chart, the IMGT repertoire. By its high quality and its easy data distribution, IMGT has important implications in medical research (repertoire in autoimmune diseases, AIDS, leukemias, lymphomas), therapeutic approaches (antibody engineering), genome diversity and genome evolution studies. IMGT is freely available at http://imgt.cnusc.fr:8104
Because the number of post-translational modifications requiring standardized annotation in the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database was large and steadily increasing, a database of protein structure modifications was constructed in 1993 to assist in producing appropriate feature annotations for covalent binding sites, modified sites and cross-links. In 1995 RESID was publicly released as a PIR-international text database distributed on CD-ROM and accessible through the ATLAS program. In 1998 it was made available on the PIR Web site at http://wwwnbrf.georgetown.edu/pir/searchdb.html. The RESID Database includes such information as: systematic and frequently observed alternate names; Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers; atomic formulas and weights; enzyme activities; indicators for N-terminal, C-terminal or peptide chain cross-link modifications; keywords; and literature citations with database cross-references. The RESID Database can be used to predict atomic masses for peptides, and is being enhanced to provide molecular structures for graphical presentation on the PIR Web site using widely available molecular viewing programs.
The DBcat (http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/dbcat) is a comprehensive catalog of biological databases, maintained and curated on a daily basis at GIS Infobiogen. It contains more than 400 databases classified by application domains. The DBcat is a structured flat file library, that can be searched by means of an SRS server or a dedicated Web interface. The files are available for downloading from Infobiogen anonymous ftp server.
Proclass is a protein family database that organizes non-redundant sequence entries into families defined collectively by prosite patterns and pir superfamilies. By combining global similarities and functional motifs into a single classification scheme, proclass helps to reveal domain and family relationships and classify multi-domain proteins. The database currently consists of more than 120 000 sequence entries, ∼60% of which is classified into about 3500 families. To maximize family information retrieval, the database provides links to various protein family/ domain and structural class databases and contains multiple motif alignments of all prosite patterns as well as global alignments of pir superfamilies. The motif sequences are retrieved from both pir-international and swiss-prot databases, including a large number of new members detected by our genefind family identification system. Proclass can be used to support full-scale genomic annotation, because of its high classification rate. The proclass database is available for on-line search and record retrieval from our www server at http://diana.uthct.edu/proclass.html
The promise (prosthetic centres and metal ions in protein active sites) database aims to present comprehensive sequence, structural, functional and bibliographic information on metalloproteins and other complex proteins, with an emphasis on active site structure and function. the database is available on the worldwide web at http://bioinf.leeds.ac.uk/promise/

The flybase drosophila genetics database and the public interfaces of the berkeley drosophila genome project (bdgp) and european drosophila genome project (edgp) are in the process of integrating. at present, the data of these projects are available from independent, but hyperlinked, www sites (flybase url, http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/; BDGP URL, http://fruitfly.berkeley.edu/; EDGP URL, http://edgp.ebi.ac.uk/). Because of the considerable overlap of data classes between the contributions of the Drosophila genome projects and the Drosophila community, the new and enlarged FlyBase consortium views the implementation of a single integrated Drosophila genomics/genetics server as essential to the scientific community. This integration will occur in a stepwise fashion over the next 1–2 years. In this report, the salient features of the current databases and how to interrogate and navigate the extensive data sets are discussed.

Prostate ESTs are assembled into distinct species groups using the multiple alignment program CAP2 and are annotated with information from the GenBank, dbEST and Unigene public sequence databases. Annotated sequences in PEDB are searched using the BLAST algorithm. The differential expression of each EST species can be viewed across all libraries using a Virtual Expression Analysis Tool (VEAT), a graphical user interface written in Java for intra- and inter-library species comparisons. PEDB may be accessed via the World Wide Web at http://www.mbt.washington.edu/PEDB/
CyanoBase provides internet access to the complete genomic information of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. CyanoBase contains annotations to each protein-coding gene, deduced from the entire nucleotide sequence of the genome, gene classification lists, keywords and similarity search engines. The present paper describes a recent extension of CyanoBase, named CyanoMutants. CyanoMutants is a repository database of mutant information on PCC6803. Each entry contains a dataset which describes a gene identifier, mutant information, and an address for correspondence. Two closely-linked databases, CyanoBase and CyanoMutants, connect information obtained from computational analysis to experimental analysis resulting in the clarification of the functions of hypothetical genes of the cyanobacterial genome. CyanoMutants can be accessed at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/mutants/
Flynets (http://gifts.univ-mrs.fr/FlyNets/FlyNets_home_page.html) is a WWW database describing molecular interactions (protein-DNA, protein-RNA and protein-protein) in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. It is composed of two parts, as follows. (i) FlyNets-base is a specialized database which focuses on molecular interactions involved in Drosophila development. The information content of FlyNets-base is distributed among several specific lines arranged according to a GenBank-like format and grouped into five thematic zones to improve human readability. The FlyNets database achieves a high level of integration with other databases such as FlyBase, EMBL, GenBank and SWISS-PROT through numerous hyperlinks. (ii) FlyNetslist is a very simple and more general databank, the long-term goal of which is to report on any published molecular interaction occuring in the fly, giving direct web access to corresponding abstracts in Medline and in FlyBase. In the context of genome projects, databases describing molecular interactions and genetic networks will provide a link at the functional level between the genome, the proteome and the transcriptome worlds of different organisms. Interaction databases therefore aim at describing the contents, structure, function and behaviour of what we herein define as the interactome world.
The 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs may play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression controlling mRNA localization, stability and translational efficiency. For this reason we developed UTRdb (http://bigarea.area.ba.cnr.it:8000/Biowww/#UTRdb), a specialized database of 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs cleaned from redundancy. UTRdb entries are enriched with specialized information not present in the primary databases including the presence of nucleotide sequence patterns already demonstrated by experimental analysis to have some functional role. All these patterns have been collected in the UTRsite database so that it is possible to search any input sequence for the presence of annotated functional motifs. Furthermore, UTRdb entries have been annotated for the presence of repetitive elements.
As of September, 1998, a total of 43 sequences are contained within the tmRNA database (tmRDB). the tmRNA sequences are arranged alphabetically and ordered phylogenetically. The alignment of the tmRNAS emphasizes the basepairs that are supported by comparative sequence analysis and establishes minimal secondary structures for the known tmRNAs. A corresponding alignment of the predicted tmrnaencoded tag peptides is presented. the tmRDB also offers a small number of RNA secondary structure diagrams and PDB-formatted three-dimensional models generated with the program ERNA-3D. The data are available freely at the URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/tmRDB/tmRDB.html
The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP-II), previously described by Maidak et al. [Nucleic Acids Res. (1997), 25, 109–111], is now hosted by the Center for Microbial Ecology at Michigan State University. RDP-II is a curated database that offers ribosomal RNA (rRNA) nucleotide sequence data in aligned and unaligned forms, analysis services, and associated computer programs. During the past two years, data alignments have been updated and now include >9700 small subunit rRNA sequences. The recent development of an ObjectStore database will provide more rapid updating of data, better data accuracy and increased user access. RDP-II includes phylogenetically ordered alignments of rRNA sequences, derived phylogenetic trees, rRNA secondary structure diagrams, and various software programs for handling, analyzing and displaying alignments and trees. The data are available via anonymous ftp (ftp.cme.msu.edu) and WWW (http://www.cme.msu.edu/RDP). The WWW server provides ribosomal probe checking, approximate phylogenetic placement of user-submitted sequences, screening for possible chimeric rRNA sequences, automated alignment, and a suggested placement of an unknown sequence on an existing phylogenetic tree. Additional utilities also exist at RDP-II, including distance matrix, T-RFLP, and a Java-based viewer of the phylogenetic trees that can be used to create subtrees.
O-GLYCBASE is a database of glycoproteins with O-linked glycosylation sites. entries with at least one experimentally verified O-glycosylation site have been compiled from protein sequence databases and literature. Each entry contains information about the glycan involved, the species, sequence, a literature reference and http-linked cross-references to other databases. Version 4.0 contains 179 protein entries, an approximate 15% increase over the last version. Sequence logos representing the acceptor specificity patterns for GaLNAc, GlcNAc, mannosyl and xylosyl transferases are shown. the O-GLYCBASE database is available through the WWW at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/OGLYCBASE/
The Database of Ribosomal Cross-links (DRC) was created in 1997. Here we describe new data incorporated into this database and several new features of the DRC. The DRC is freely available via World Wide Web at http://visitweb.com/database/ or http://www.mpimg-berlin-dahlem.mpg.de/~ag_ribo/ag_brimacombe/drc/
The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) is an annotated non-redundant collection of eukaryotic POL II promoters, for which the transcription start site has been determined experimentally. Access to promoter sequences is provided by pointers to positions in nucleotide sequence entries. The annotation part of an entry includes description of the initiation site mapping data, cross-references to other databases, and bibliographic references. EPD is structured in a way that facilitates dynamic extraction of biologically meaningful promoter subsets for comparative sequence analysis. Recent efforts have focused on exhaustive crossreferencing to the EMBL nucleotide sequence database, and on the improvement of the WWW-based user interfaces and data retrieval mechanisms. EPD can be accessed at http://www.epd.isb-sib.ch
The PROSITE database (http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/prosite.html) consists of biologically significant patterns and profiles formulated in such a way that with appropriate computational tools it can help to determine to which known family of protein (if any) a new sequence belongs, or which known domain(s) it contains.
Molecular Biology Database List (MBDL) includes brief descriptions and pointers to web sites for the various databases described in this issue as well as other web sites presenting data sets relevant to molecular biology. this information is compiled into a list (http://www.oup.co.uk/nar/Volume_27/issue_01/summary/gkc105_gml.html) which includes links both to source Web sites and to on-line versions of articles describing the databases.
This report provides a summary of the sequencing project of the small chromosome (CII) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1T, and introduces the first version of the genome database of this bacterium. The database organizes and describes diverse sets of biological information. The main role of the R.sphaeroides genome database (RsGDB) is to provide public access to the collected genomic information for R.sphaeroides via the World-Wide Web at http://utmmg.med.uth.tmc.edu/sphaeroides. The database allows the user access to hundreds of low redundancy R.sphaeroides sequences for further database searching, a summary of our current search results, and other allied information pertaining to this bacterium.
Inteins are intervening sequences that splice as proteins, not RNA. InBase, the New England Biolabs Intein Database (http://www.neb.com/neb/inteins.html), is a comprehensive on-line database that includes the Intein Registry, along with detailed information about each intein and its host protein, tabulated comparisons and a comprehensive bibliography including papers in press.
In last few years much data has accumulated which shows that in different cells various RNA transcripts are synthesized. They lack protein coding capacity and do not produce mature protein. It seems that they work mainly or exclusively on the RNA level. Their function and mechanism of action is poorly understood. In this paper we have collected all known RNA transcript and prepared a database for further structural and functional studies. This is the first collection of the nucleotide sequences of RNAs of this kind. The data can be accessed via WWW at: http://www.man.poznan.pl/5SData/ncRNA/index.html
The Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database provides a detailed and comprehensive description of the relationships of all known proteins structures. The classification is on hierarchical levels: the first two levels, family and superfamily, describe near and far evolutionary relationships; the third, fold, describes geometrical relationships. The distinction between evolutionary relationships and those that arise from the physics and chemistry of proteins is a feature that is unique to this database, so far. The database can be used as a source of data to calibrate sequence search algorithms and for the generation of population statistics on protein structures. The database and its associated files are freely accessible from a number of WWW sites mirrored from URL http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/
The Gene Expression Database (GXD) is a community resource that stores and integrates expression information for the laboratory mouse, with a particular emphasis on mouse development, and makes these data freely available in formats appropriate for comprehensive analysis. GXD is implemented as a relational database and integrated with the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) to enable global analysis of genotype, expression and phenotype information. Interconnections with sequence databases and with databases from other species further extend GXD's utility for the analysis of gene expression data. GXD is available through the Mouse Genome Informatics Web Site at http://www.informatics.jax.org/
Place (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/htdocs/PLACE/) is a database of nucleotide sequence motifs found in plant cis-acting regulatory DNA elements. Motifs were extracted from previously published reports on genes in vascular plants. In addition to the motifs originally reported, their variations in other genes or in other plant species in later reports are also compiled. Documents for each motif in the PLACE database contains, in addition to a motif sequence, a brief definition and description of each motif, and relevant literature with PubMed ID numbers and GenBank accession numbers where available. Users can search their query sequences for cis-elements using the Signal Scan program at our web site. The results will be reported in one of the three forms. Clicking the PLACE accession numbers in the result report will open the pertinent motif document. Clicking the PubMed or GenBank accession number in the document will allow users to access to these databases, and to read the abstract of the literature or the annotation in the DNA database. This report summarizes the present status of this database and available tools.
In the framework of the EU BIOTECH PROGRAM and within the ‘MITBASE: a comprehensive and integrated database on mtDNA’ project, we have prepared a pilot database (MitBASE Pilot) on nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and its regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MitBASE Pilot includes nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins as well as nuclear genes encoding products which are localised in other sub-cellular compartments but nevertheless interact with mitochondrial functions. Genes have been classified on the basis of the mitochondrial process in which they participate and the mitochondrial phenotype of the gene knockout. The structure of the MitBASE Pilot database has been conceived for a flexible organisation of the information. An intuitive visual query system has been developed which allows users to select information in different combinations, both in the query and the output format, according to their needs. MitBASE Pilot is a relational database, is maintained at the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and is available at the World Wide Web site http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Research/Mitbase/mitbiog.pl
Nowadays it is possible to unravel complex information at all levels of cellular organization by obtaining multi-dimensional image information. at the macromolecular level, three-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy, together with other techniques, is able to reach resolutions at the nanometer or subnanometer level. The information is delivered in the form of 3D volumes containing samples of a given function, for example, the electron density distribution within a given macromolecule. The same situation happens at the cellular level with the new forms of light microscopy, particularly confocal microscopy, all of which produce biological 3D volume information. Furthermore, it is possible to record sequences of images over time (videos), as well as sequences of volumes, bringing key information on the dynamics of living biological systems. It is in this context that work on bioimage started two years ago, and that its first version is now presented here. In essence, Bioimage is a database specifically designed to contain multi-dimensional images, perform queries and interactively work with the resulting multi-dimensional information on the World Wide Web, as well as accomplish the required cross-database links. Two sister home pages of bioimage can be accessed at http://www.bioimage.org and http://www-embl.bioimage.org
Vertebrate MitBASE is a specialized database where all the vertebrate mitochondrial DNA entries from primary databases are collected, revised and integrated with new information emerging from the literature. Variant sequences are also analyzed, aligned and linked to reference sequences. Data related to the same species and fragment can be viewed over the WWW. The database has a flexible interface and a retrieval system to help non-expert users and contains information not currently available in the primary databases. Vertebrate MitBASE is now available through the MitBASE home page at URL: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/htbin/Mitbase/mitbase.pl. This work is part of a larger project, MitBASE which is a network of databases covering the full panorama of knowledge on mitochondrial DNA from protists to human sequences.
The ENZYME data bank is a repository of information related to the nomenclature of enzymes. In recent years it has become an indispensable resource for the development of metabolic databases. The current version contains information on 3704 enzymes. It is available through the ExPASy WWW server (http://www.expasy.ch/).
The Mouse Tumor Biology (MTB) Database supports the use of the mouse as a model system of hereditary and induced cancers by providing electronic access to: (i) tumor names and classifications, (ii) tumor incidence and latency data in different strains of mice, (iii) tumor pathology reports and images, (iv) information on genetic factors associated with tumors and tumor development, and (v) references (published and unpublished data). This resource has been designed to aid researchers in such areas as choosing experimental models, reviewing patterns of mutations in specific cancers, and identifying genes that are commonly mutated across a spectrum of cancers. MTB also provides hypertext links to related on-line resources and databases. MTB is accessible via the World Wide Web at http://tumor.informatics.jax.org. User support is available for MTB by Email at mgi-help@informatics.jax.org
The ProDom database contains protein domain families generated from the SWISS-PROT database by automated sequence comparisons. The current version was built with a new improved procedure based on recursive PSI-BLAST homology searches. ProDom can be searched on the World Wide Web to study domain arrangements within either known families or new proteins, with the help of a user-friendly graphical interface (http://www.toulouse.inra.fr/prodom.html). Recent improvements to the ProDom server include: ProDom queries under the SRS Sequence Retrieval System; links to the PredictProtein server; phylogenetic trees and condensed multiple alignments for a better representation of large domain families, with zooming in and out capabilities. In addition, a similar server was set up to display the outcome of whole genome domain analysis as applied to 17 completed microbial genomes (http://www.toulouse.inra.fr/prodomCG.html).
We report the latest release (version 1.4) of the CATH protein domains database (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath). This is a hierarchical classification of 13 359 protein domain structures into evolutionary families and structural groupings. We currently identify 827 homologous families in which the proteins have both structual similarity and sequence and/or functional similarity. These can be further clustered into 593 fold groups and 32 distinct architectures. Using our structural classification and associated data on protein functions, stored in the database (EC identifiers, SWISS-PROT keywords and information from the Enzyme database and literature) we have been able to analyse the correlation between the 3D structure and function. More than 96% of folds in the PDB are associated with a single homologous family. However, within the superfolds, three or more different functions are observed. Considering enzyme functions, more than 95% of clearly homologous families exhibit either single or closely related functions, as demonstrated by the EC identifiers of their relatives. Our analysis supports the view that determining structures, for example as part of a ‘structural genomics’ initiative, will make a major contribution to interpreting genome data.
The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) focuses on the integration of mapping, homology, polymorphism and molecular data about the laboratory mouse. Detailed descriptions of genes including their chromosomal location, gene function, disease associations, mutant phenotypes, molecular polymorphisms and links to representative sequences including ESTs are integrated within MGD. The association of information from experiment to gene to genome requires careful coordination and implementation of standardized vocabularies, unique nomenclature constructions, and detailed information derived from multiple sources. This information is linked to other public databases that focus on additional information such as expression patterns, sequences, bibliographic details and large mapping panel data. Scientists participate in the curation of MGD data by generating the Chromosome Committee Reports, consulting on gene family nomenclature revisions, and providing descriptions of mouse strain characteristics and of new mutant phenotypes. MGD is accessible at http://www.informatics.jax.org
The EcoCyc database describes the genome and gene products of Escherichia coli, its metabolic and signaltransduction pathways, and its trNAS. The database describes 4391 genes of E.coli, 695 enzymes encoded by a subset of these genes, 904 metabolic reactions that occur in E.coli, and the organization of these reactions into 129 metabolic pathways. The EcoCyc graphical user interface allows scientists to query and explore the EcoCyc database using visualization tools such as genomic-map browsers and automatic layouts of metabolic pathways. EcoCyc has many references to the primary literature, and is a (qualitative) computational model of E.coli metabolism. EcoCyc is available at URL http://ecocyc.PangeaSystems.com/ecocyc/
PhosphoBase contains information about phosphorylated residues in proteins and data about peptide phosphorylation by a variety of protein kinases. The data are collected from literature and compiled into a common format. The current release of PhosphoBase (October 1998, version 2.0) comprises 414 phosphoprotein entries covering 1052 phosphorylatable serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. The kinetic data from peptide phosphorylation assays for ∼330 oligopeptides is also included. The database entries are cross-referenced to the corresponding records in the Swiss-Prot protein database and literature references are linked to MedLine records. PhosphoBase is available via the WWW at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/PhosphoBase/
Pfam is a collection of multiple alignments and profile hidden Markov models of protein domain families. Release 3.1 is a major update of the Pfam database and contains 1313 families which are available on the World Wide Web in Europe at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/ and http://www.cgr.ki.se/Pfam/, and in the US at http://pfam.wustl.edu/. Over 54% of proteins in SWISS-PROT-35 and SP-TrEMBL-5 match a Pfam family. The primary changes of Pfam since release 2.1 are that we now use the more advanced version 2 of the HMMER software, which is more sensitive and provides expectation values for matches, and that it now includes proteins from both SP-TrEMBL and SWISS-PROT.
The MEROPS database (http://www.bi.bbsrc.ac.uk/Merops/Merops.htm) provides a catalogue and structure-based classification of peptidases (i.e. all proteolytic enzymes). This is a large group of proteins (∼2% of all gene products) that is of particular importance in medicine and biotechnology. An index of the peptidases by name or synonym gives access to a set of files termed PepCards each of which provides information on a single peptidase. Each card file contains information on classification and nomenclature, and hypertext links to the relevant entries in online databases for human genetics, protein and nucleic acid sequence data and tertiary structure. Another index provides access to the PepCards by organism name so that the user can retrieve all known peptidases from a particular species. The peptidases are classified into families on the basis of statistically significant similarities between the protein sequences in the part termed the ‘peptidase unit’ that is most directly responsible for activity. Families that are thought to have common evolutionary origins and are known or expected to have similar tertiary folds are grouped into clans. The MEROPS database provides sets of files called FamCards and ClanCards describing the individual families and clans. Each FamCard document provides links to other databases for sequence motifs and secondary and tertiary structures, and shows the distribution of the family across the major kingdoms of living creatures. Release 3.03 of MEROPS contains 758 peptidases, 153 families and 22 clans. We suggest that the MEROPS database provides a model for a way in which a system of classification for a functional group of proteins can be developed and used as an organizational framework around which to assemble a variety of related information.
The HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database is an on-line relational database that catalogues evolutionary and drug-related human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease sequence variation (http://hivdb.stanford.edu). The database contains a compilation of nearly all published HIV RT and protease sequences including International Collaboration database submissions (e.g., GenBank) and sequences published in journal articles. Sequences are linked to data about the source of the sequence sample and the anti-HIV drug treatment history of the individual from whom the isolate was obtained. The database is curated and sequences are annotated with data from 180 literature references. Users can retrieve additional data and view alignments of sequences sets meeting specific criteria (e.g., treatment history, subtype, presence of a particular mutation).
In the past several years, there has been a tremendous effort to construct physical maps and to sequence the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. As a result, four of the five chromosomes are completely covered by overlapping clones except at the centromeric and nucleolus organizer regions (NOR). In addition, over 30% of the genome has been sequenced and completion is anticipated by the end of the year 2000. Despite these accomplishments, the physical maps are provided in many formats on laboratories' Web sites. These data are thus difficult to obtain in a coherent manner for researchers. To alleviate this problem, AtDB (Arabidopsis thaliana DataBase, URL: http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/) has constructed a unified display of the physical maps where all publicly available physical-map data for all chromosomes are presented through the Web in a clickable, ‘on-the-fly’ graphic, created by CGI programs that directly consult our relational database.
tmRNA (10Sa RNA) has a central role in transtranslation, in which a peptide tag encoded in tmRNA is added to the abnormally short protein product of a broken mRNA, as a signal for proteolysis of the entire tagged protein. The tmRNA website was established in 1997 as a resource for phylogenetic considerations of tmRNA structure and function. Since then, three partial tmRNA sequences have been completed, and sequences from 13 more species have been identified. Forty-six species from 10 bacterial phyla and chloroplasts are now represented in the database. Provisional sequence alignments and predicted proteolysis tag sequences are provided, as well as a literature review and a guide to searching for new tmRNA sequences. The tmRNA website is accessible via WWW at a new URL: http://sunflower.bio.indiana.edu/~kwilliam/tmRNA/home.html
RegulonDB version 2.0, a database on transcriptional regulation and operon organization in Escherichia coli, is now available on the web at the following URL: http://www.cifn.unam.mx/Computational_Biology/regulondb/. In this paper we describe the main computational changes to the database, which include migrating the database to Sybase, providing graphical descriptions of the internal organization of operons and regulons, and direct links to MEDLINE references. The web interface offers searching either by mechanisms of regulation or by operon organization. The results of a search (operon organization, or site collection) are displayed as hypertext, and can also be displayed graphically. In terms of its contents, RegulonDB contains a large number of operons, as well as the absolute position in the completed genome sequence of sites, promoters, and individual genes of E.coli.
The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl.html) constitutes Europe's primary nucleotide sequence resource. Main sources for DNA and RNA sequences are direct submissions from individual researchers, genome sequencing projects and patent applications. While automatic procedures allow incorporation of sequence data from large-scale genome sequencing centres and from the European Patent Office (EPO), the preferred submission tool for individual submitters is Webin (WWW). Through all stages, dataflow is monitored by EBI biologists communicating with the sequencing groups. In collaboration with DDBJ and GenBank the database is produced, maintained and distributed at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). Database releases are produced quarterly and are distributed on CD-ROM. Network services allow access to the most up-to-date data collection via Internet and World Wide Web interface. EBI's Sequence Retrieval System (SRS) is a Network Browser for Databanks in Molecular Biology, integrating and linking the main nucleotide and protein databases, plus many specialised databases. For sequence similarity searching a variety of tools (e.g. Blitz, Fasta, Blast etc) are available for external users to compare their own sequences against the most currently available data in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database and SWISS-PROT.
PlantCARE is a database of plant cis-acting regulatory elements, enhancers and repressors. Besides the transcription motifs found on a sequence, it also offers a link to the EMBL entry that contains the full gene sequence as well as a description of the conditions in which a motif becomes functional. The information on these sites is given by matrices, consensus and individual site sequences on particular genes, depending on the available information. PlantCARE is a relational database available via the web at the URL: http://sphinx.rug.ac.be:8080/PlantCARE/
The MITOP database http://websvr.mips.biochem.mpg.de/proj/medgen/mitop/ consolidates information on both nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded genes and their proteins. The five species files—Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, Neurospora crassa and Homo sapiens—include annotated data derived from a variety of online resources and the literature. A wide spectrum of search facilities is given in the interelated sections ‘Gene catalogues’, ‘Protein catalogues’, ‘Homologies’, ‘Pathways and metabolism’, and ‘Human disease catalogue’ including extensive references and hyperlinks for each entry. Precomputed FASTA searches using all the MITOP yeast protein entries and a list of the best EST hits with graphical cluster alignments related to the yeast reference sequence are presented. The MITOP orthologue tables with cross-listing to all the protein entries for each species in the database facilitate investigations into interspecies homology. A program (MITOPROT) is available to identify mitochondrial targeting sequences and graphical depictions of several important mitochondrial processes are included. The ‘Human disease catalogue’ lists a total of 101 disorders related to mitochondrial protein abnormalities, sorted by clinical criteria and age of onset.
AAindex is a database of numerical indices representing various physicochemical and biochemical properties of amino acids and pairs of amino acids. It consists of two sections: AAindex1 for the amino acid index of 20 numerical values and AAindex2 for the amino acid mutation matrix of 210 numerical values. Each entry of either AAindex1 or AAindex2 consists of the definition, the reference information, a list of related entries in terms of the correlation coefficient, and the actual data. The database may be accessed through the DBGET/LinkDB system at GenomeNet (http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget/) or may be downloaded by anonymous FTP (ftp://ftp.genome.ad.jp/db/genomenet/aaindex/).
Since the obtention of the complete sequence of Haemophilus influenzae Rd in 1995, the number of bacterial genomes entirely sequenced has regularly increased. A problem is that the quality of the annotations of these very large sequences is usually lower than those of the shorter entries encountered in the repository collections. Moreover, classical sequence database management systems have difficulties in handling entries of that size. In this context, we have decided to build the Enhanced Microbial Genomes Library (EMGLib) in which these two problems are alleviated. This library contains all the complete genomes from bacteria already sequenced and the yeast genome in GenBank format. The annotations are improved by the introduction of data on codon usage, gene orientation on the chromosome and gene families. It is possible to access emglib through two database systems set up on World Wide Web servers: the PBIL server at http://pbil.univlyon1.fr/emglib/emglib.html and the MICADO server at http://locus.jouy.inra.fr/micado
Mitbase is an integrated and comprehensive database of mitochondrial DNA data which collects all available information from different organisms and from intraspecie variants and mutants. Research institutions from different countries are involved, each in charge of developing, collecting and annotating data for the organisms they are specialised in. The design of the actual structure of the database and its implementation in a user-friendly format are the care of the European Bioinformatics Institute. The database can be accessed on the Web at the following address: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/htbin/Mitbase/mitbase.pl. The impact of this project is intended for both basic and applied research. The study of mitochondrial genetic diseases and mitochondrial DNA intraspecie diversity are key topics in several biotechnological fields. The database has been funded within the EU Biotechnology programme.
The three dimensional structures for representatives of nearly half of all protein families are now available in public databases. Thus, no matter which protein one investigates, it is increasingly likely that the 3D structure of a homolog will be known and may reveal unsuspected structure-function relationships. The goal of Entrez's 3D-structure database is to make this information accessible and usable by molecular biologists (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez). To this end Entrez provides two major analysis tools, a search engine based on sequence and structure ‘neighboring’ and an integrated visualization system for sequence and structure alignments. From a protein's sequence ‘neighbors’ one may rapidly identify other members of a protein family, including those where 3D structure is known. By comparing aligned sequences and/or structures in detail, using the visualization system, one may identify conserved features and perhaps infer functional properties. Here we describe how these analysis tools may be used to investigate the structure and function of newly discovered proteins, using the PTEN gene product as an example.
The signal recognition particle database (SRPDB) is located at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler and includes tabulations of SRP RNA, SRP protein and SRP receptor sequences. The sequences are annotated with links to the primary databases. They are ordered alphabetically or phylogenetically and are available in aligned form. As of September, 1998, there were 108 SRP RNA sequences, 83 SRP protein sequences and 28 sequences of the SRP receptor α subunit and its homologues. In addition, the SRPDB provides search motifs consisting of conserved amino acid and nucleotide residues, and a limited number of SRP RNA secondary structure diagrams and 3-D models. the data are available freely at the URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html
This is an online database to facilitate research on viroid, viroid-like RNAs and human hepatitis delta virus (VHDV) by presenting a large number of sequences and related data in a comprehensive and user-friendly format (e.g. position of their self-catalytic domains, open reading frame of the vHDV, prediction of the most stable secondary structures, etc.). Most of these RNA species share a common proposed replication pattern known as a DNA-independent rolling circle mechanism. Together, these species form the ‘brotherhood’ of the smallest known auto-replicable RNAS. This online database is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.callisto.si.usherb.ca/~jpperra
The RNA editing process within the mitochondria of kinetoplastid organisms is controlled by small, trans-acting RNA molecules referred to as guide RNAs. the guide RNA database is a compilation of published guide RNA sequences, currently containing 254 entries from 11 different organisms. Additional information includes RNA secondary and tertiary structure models, information on the gene localisation, literature citations and other relevant facts. The database can be accessed through the World Wide Web (www) at http://www.biochem.mpg.de/~goeringe/
The aim of ‘Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology’ (http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/chromcancer) is to present summarized information on chromosome abnormalities in cancer, with extensions to genes involved in cancer and to cancer-prone diseases. Information is to be updated. This database is made for and by cytogeneticists, molecular biologists, clinicians in oncology and in haematology, and pathologists.
The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) collects and organizes information about the molecular biology and genetics of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The latest protein structure and comparison tools available at SGD are presented here. With the completion of the yeast sequence and the Caenorhabditis elegans sequence soon to follow, comparison of proteins from complete eukaryotic proteomes will be an extremely powerful way to learn more about a particular protein's structure, its function, and its relationships with other proteins. SGD can be accessed through the World Wide Web at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/
EpoDB is a database of genes expressed in vertebrate red blood cells. It is also a prototype for the creation of cell and tissue-specific databases from multiple external sources. The information in EpoDB obtained from GenBank, SWISS-PROT, Transfac, TRRD and GERD is curated to provide high quality data for sequence analysis aimed at understanding gene regulation during erythropoiesis. New protocols have been developed for data integration and updating entries. Using a BLAST-based algorithm, we have grouped GenBank entries representing the same gene together. This sequence similarity protocol was also used to identify new entries to be included in EpoDB. We have recently implemented our database in Sybase (relational tables) in addition to SICStus Prolog to provide us with greater flexibility in asking complex queries that utilize information from multiple sources. New additions to the public web site (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/epodb) for accessing EpoDB are the ability to retrieve groups of entries representing different variants of the same gene and to retrieve gene expression data. The BLAST query has been enhanced by incorporating BLASTView, an interactive and graphical display of BLAST results. We have also enhanced the queries for retrieving sequence from specified genes by the addition of MEME, a motif discovery tool, to the integrated analysis tools which include CLUSTALW and TESS.
REBASE is a comprehensive database of information about restriction enzymes and their associated methylases, including their recognition and cleavage sites and their commercial availability. Also included is a listing of homing endonucleases. Information from REBASE is distributed via monthly electronic mailings as well as through anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. The REBASE web site (http://www.neb.com/rebase) contains a web page for every enzyme, reference and supplier. Additionally, there is a search facility, help and NEWS pages, and a complete description of our various services. Specialized files are available that can be used directly by many software packages.
During 1998 the primary focus of the Genome Sequence DataBase (GSDB; http://www.ncgr.org/gsdb) located at the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) has been to improve data quality, improve data collections, and provide new methods and tools to access and analyze data. Data quality has been improved by extensive curation of certain data fields necessary for maintaining data collections and for using certain tools. Data quality has also been increased by improvements to the suite of programs that import data from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (IC). The Sequence Tag Alignment and Consensus Knowledgebase (STACK), a database of human expressed gene sequences developed by the South African National Bioinformatics Institute (SANBI), became available within the last year, allowing public access to this valuable resource of expressed sequences. Data access was improved by the addition of the Sequence Viewer, a platform-independent graphical viewer for GSDB sequence data. This tool has also been integrated with other searching and data retrieval tools. A BLAST homology search service was also made available, allowing researchers to search all of the data, including the unique data, that are available from GSDB. These improvements are designed to make GSDB more accessible to users, extend the rich searching capability already present in GSDB, and to facilitate the transition to an integrated system containing many different types of biological data.
The sixth release of the SBASE protein domain library sequences contains 130 703 annotated and crossreferenced entries corresponding to structural, functional, ligand-binding and topogenic segments of proteins. The entries were grouped based on standard names (2312 groups) and futher classified on the basis of the BLAST similarity (2463 clusters). Automated searching with BLAST and a new sequence-plot representation of local domain similarities are available at the www-server http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/sbase. A mirror site is at http://sbase.abc.hu/sbase. The database is freely available by anonymous ‘ftp’ file transfer from ftp.icgeb.trieste.it
With so many databases available for research in the Human Genome Project, it is crucial to efficiently relate information from different resources. For that purpose, we maintain Virgil, a database of rich links for data browsing, data analysis and database interconnection. Virgil current version contains more than 40 000 rich links from five major databases: SWISS-PROT, GenBank, PDB, GDB and OMIM. Materials described in this paper are available from http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/virgil/
The Protein Information Resource (PIR; http://wwwnbrf.georgetown.edu/pir/) supports research on molecular evolution, functional genomics, and computational biology by maintaining a comprehensive, non-redundant, well-organized and freely available protein sequence database. Since 1988 the database has been maintained collaboratively by PIR-International, an international association of data collection centers cooperating to develop this resource during a period of explosive growth in new sequence data and new computer technologies. The PIR Protein Sequence Database entries are classified into superfamilies, families and homology domains, for which sequence alignments are available. Full-scale family classification supports comparative genomics research, aids sequence annotation, assists database organization and improves database integrity. The PIR WWW server supports direct on-line sequence similarity searches, information retrieval, and knowledge discovery by providing the Protein Sequence Database and other supplementary databases. Sequence entries are extensively cross-referenced and hypertext-linked to major nucleic acid, literature, genome, structure, sequence alignment and family databases. The weekly release of the Protein Sequence Database can be accessed through the PIR Web site. The quarterly release of the database is freely available from our anonymous FTP server and is also available on CD-ROM with the accompanying ATLAS database search program.
PRINTS is a diagnostic collection of protein fingerprints. Fingerprints exploit groups of motifs to build characteristic family signatures, offering improved diagnostic reliability over single-motif approaches by virtue of the mutual context provided by motif neighbours. Around 1000 fingerprints have now been created and stored in PRINTS. The September 1998 release (version 20.0), encodes ∼5700 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides and so on. The database is accessible via the DbBrowser Web Server at http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/. In addition to supporting its continued growth, recent enhancements to the resource include a BLAST server, and more efficient fingerprint search software, with improved statistics for estimating the reliability of retrieved matches. Current efforts are focused on the design of more automated methods for database maintenance; implementation of an object-relational schema for efficient data management; and integration with PROSITE, profiles, Pfam and ProDom, as part of the international InterPro project, which aims to unify protein pattern databases and offer improved tools for genome analysis.
KEYnet is a database where gene and protein names are hierarchically structured. Particular care has been devoted to the search and organisation of synonyms. The structuring is based on biological criteria in order to assist the user in the data search and to minimise the risk of loss of information. Links to the EMBL data library by the entry name and the accession number have been implemented. KEYnet is available through the World Wide Web at the following site: http://www.ba.cnr.it/keynet.html. Recently KEYnet has incorporated specific gene name classifications, which can be browsed starting from the abovementioned KEYnet home page: the Mitochondrial Gene Names classification and the Rat Gene Names classification. KEYnet database has also been structured in a flatfile format and can be queried through SRS (http://bio-www.ba.cnr.t:8000/srs).
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) are the key components of the protein biosynthesis machinery. They are responsible for maintaining the fidelity of transfer of genetic information from DNA into protein. The database is a compilation of amino acid sequences of all aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases known to date. It contains 422 primary structures of the AARSs available as separate entries or alignments of related proteins. The database is available via the World Wide Web at http://rose.man.poznan.pl/aars/index.html
The University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation database (UM-BBD, http://www.labmed.umn.edu/umbbd/index.html) first became available on the web in 1995 to provide information on microbial biocatalytic reactions of, and biodegradation pathways for, organic chemical compounds, especially those produced by man. Its goal is to become a representative database of biodegradation, spanning the diversity of known microbial metabolic routes, organic functional groups, and environmental conditions under which biodegradation occurs. The database can be used to enhance understanding of basic biochemistry, biocatalysis leading to speciality chemical manufacture, and biodegradation of environmental pollutants. It is also a resource for functional genomics, since it contains information on enzymes and genes involved in specialized metabolism not found in intermediary metabolism databases, and thus can assist in assigning functions to genes homologous to such less common genes. With information on >400 reactions and compounds, it is poised to become a resource for prediction of microbial biodegradation pathways for compounds it does not contain, a process complementary to predicting the functions of new classes of microbial genes.
Human MitBASE is a database collecting human mtdna variants. This database is part of a greater mitochondrial genome database (MitBASE) funded within the EU biotech program. the present paper reports the recent improvements in data structure, data quality and data quantity. As far as the database structure is concerned it is now fully designed and implemented. Based on the previously described structure some changes have been made to optimise both data input and data quality. cross-references with other bio-databases (EMBL, OMIM, MEDLINE) have been implemented. human MitBASE data can be queried with the MitBASE simple query system (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/htbin/Mitbase/mitbase.pl) and with SRS at the EBI under the ‘Mutation’ section (http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srs5/). At present the Human MitBASE node contains ∼5000 variants related to studies investigating population polymorphisms and pathologies.
TransTerm is a database of mRNA sequences and parameters useful for detecting translational control signals in general. TransTerm-98 has been expanded beyond previous years to include full coding sequences and UTRs, while retaining the original small contexts about the coding sequence start- and stopcodons. The database contains more than 130 000 non-redundant coding sequences with associated untranslated regions (UTRs) from over 450 species. This includes the complete genomes of 12 prokaryotic and one eukaryotic organism. Several coding sequence parameters are available: coding sequence length, Nc, GC3 and, when it is computable, Codon Adaptation Index (CAI). Codon usage tables and summaries of start- and stop-codon contexts are also included. TransTerm-98 has both a relational database form with a WWW interface and a flatfile format, also available by Internet browser. TransTerm is available at: http://biochem.otago.ac.nz:800/Transterm/homepage.html
SWISS-PROT is a curated protein sequence database which strives to provide a high level of annotation (such as the description of the function of a protein, its domain structure, post-translational modifications, variants, etc.), a minimal level of redundancy and high level of integration with other databases. Recent developments of the database include: cross-references to additional databases; a variety of new documentation files and improvements to TrEMBL, a computer annotated supplement to SWISS-PROT. TrEMBL consists of entries in SWISS-PROT-like format derived from the translation of all coding sequences (CDS) in the EMBL nucleotide sequence database, except the CDS already included in SWISS-PROT. The URLs for SWISS-PROT on the WWW are: http://www.expasy.ch/sprot and http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sprot
ooTFD is an object-oriented database for the representation of information pertaining to transcription factors, the proteins and biochemical entities which play a central role in the regulation of gene expression. Given the recent explosion of genome sequence information, and that a large percentage of proteins encoded by fully sequenced genomes fall into this category, information pertaining to this class of molecules may become an essential aspect of biology and of genomics in the 21st century. In the past year, there was a small increase in the size of this database, and a number of new tools to facilitate data access and analysis have been added at the MIRAGE (Molecular Informatics Resource for the Analysis of Gene Expression) web site. ooTFD and associated tools and resources can be accessed at http://www.ifti.org/
Over 11 500 complete or nearly complete sequences are now available from the Antwerp database on small subunit ribosomal RNA. All these sequences are aligned with one another on the basis of the adopted secondary structure model, which is corroborated by the observation of compensating substitutions in the alignment. Literature references, accession numbers and taxonomic information are also compiled. The database can be consulted via the World Wide Web at URL http://rrna.uia.ac.be/ssu/
The RNA Modification Database (http://medlib.med.utah.edu/RNAmods/) provides a comprehensive listing of naturally modified nucleosides in RNA.

From apes, 295 HVRI sequences and 13 HVRII sequences are available.
The Transcription Regulatory Regions Database (TRRD) is a curated database designed for accumulation of experimental data on extended regulatory regions of eukaryotic genes, the regulatory elements they contain, i.e., transcription factor binding sites, promoters, enhancers, silencers, etc., and expression patterns of the genes. release 4.1 of TRRD offers a number of significant improvements, in particular, a more detailed description of transcription factor binding sites, transcription factors per se, and gene expression patterns in a computer-readable format. In addition, the new TRRD release provides considerably more references to other molecular biological databases. TRRD 4.1 is installed under srs and is available through the www at http://www.bionet.nsc.ru/trrd/
The Histone Sequence Database is an annotated and searchable collection of all available histone and histone fold sequences and structures. Particular emphasis has been placed on documenting conflicts between similar sequence entries from a number of source databases, conflicts that are not necessarily documented in the source databases themselves. New additions to the database include compilations of post-translational modifications for each of the core and linker histones, as well as genomic information in the form of map loci for the human histone gene complement, with the genetic loci linked to Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). The database is freely accessible through the World Wide Web at either http://genome.nhgri.nih.gov/histones/ or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Baxevani/HISTONES
Swiss-2DPAGE (http://www.expasy.ch/ch2d/) is an annotated two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) database established in 1993. The current release contains 21 reference maps from human and mouse biological samples, as well as from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and Dictyostelium discoideum origin. These reference maps now have 2480 identified spots, corresponding to 528 separate protein entries in the database, in addition to virtual entries for each SWISS-PROT sequence. During the last year, the SWISS-2DPAGE has undergone major changes. Six new maps have been added, and new functions to access the data have been provided through the ExPASy server. Finally, an important change concerns the database funding source.
The GenBank (Registered Trademark symbol) sequence database incorporates DNA sequences from all available public sources, primarily through the direct submission of sequence data from individual laboratories and from large-scale sequencing projects. Most submitters use the Bankit (Web) or Sequin programs to format and send sequence data. Data exchange with the EMBL Data Library and the DNA Data Bank of Japan helps ensure comprehensive worldwide coverage. GenBank data is accessible through NCBI's integrated retrieval system, Entrez, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome and protein structure information. MEDLINE (Registered Trademark symbol) abstracts from published articles describing the sequences are included as an additional source of biological annotation through the PubMed search system. Sequence similarity searching is offered through the BLAST series of database search programs. In addition to FTP, Email, and server/client versions of Entrez and BLAST, NCBI offers a wide range of World Wide Web retrieval and analysis services based on GenBank data. The GenBank database and related resources are freely accessible via the URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
KinMutBase (http://www.uta.fi/laitokset/imt/KinMutBase.html) is a registry of mutations in human protein kinases related to disorders. Kinases are essential cellular signalling molecules, in which mutations can lead into diseases including, e.g., immunodeficiencies, cancers and endocrine disorders. The first release of KinMutBase contains information for nine protein tyrosine kinases. There are altogether 170 entries representing 273 families and 403 patients. Mutations appear both in conserved hallmark residues of the kinases as well as in non-homologous sites. The KinMutBase WWW pages provide plenty of information, namely mutation statistics and display, clickable sequences with mutations, restriction enzyme patterns and online submission.
The Yeast Proteome Database (YPD) is a model for the organization and presentation of comprehensive protein information. Based on the detailed curation of the scientific literature for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, YPD contains more than 50 000 annotations lines derived from the review of 8500 research publications. The information concerning each of the ∼6100 yeast proteins is structured around a convenient one-page format, the Yeast Protein Report, with additional information provided as pop-up windows. Protein classification schema have been revised this year, defining each protein's cellular role, function and pathway, and adding a Functional Abstract to the Yeast Protein Report. These changes provide the user with a succinct summary of the protein's function and its place in the biology of the cell, and they enhance the power of YPD Search functions. Precalculated sequence alignments have been added, to provide a crossover point for comparative genomics. The first transcript profiling data has been integrated into the YPD Protein Reports, providing the framework for the presentation of genome-wide functional data. The Yeast Proteome Database can be accessed on the Web at http://www.proteome.com/YPDhome.html
The present paper describes AMmtDB, a database collecting the multi-aligned sequences of vertebrate mitochondrial genes coding for proteins and tRNAs, as well as the multiple alignment of the mammalian mtDNA main regulatory region (D-loop) sequences. The genes coding for proteins are multi-aligned based on the translated sequences and both the nucleotide and amino acid multi-alignments are provided. as far as the genes coding for tRNAs are concerned, the multi-alignments based on the primary and the secondary structures are both provided; for the mammalian D-loop multi-alignments we report the conserved regions of the entire D-loop (CSB1, CSB2, CSB3, the central region, ETAS1 and ETAS2) as defined by Sbisà et al. [Gene (1997), 205, 125–140). A flatfile format for AMmtDB has been designed allowing its implementation in SRS (http://bio-www.ba.cnr.it:8000/Biowww/#AMMTDB). Data selected through SRS can be managed using GeneDoc or other programs for the management of multi-aligned data depending on the user's operative system. The multiple alignments have been produced with CLUSTALV and PILEUP programs and then carefully optimized manually.
A database of mutations in human eye disease genes has been constructed. This KMeyeDB employs a database software MutationView which provides graphical data presentation and analysis as a smooth user-interface. Currently, the KMeyeDB contains mutation data of 16 different genes for 18 eye diseases. The KMeyeDB is accessible through http://mutview.dmb.med.keio.ac.jp with advanced internet browsers.
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions in terms of the networks of genes and molecules. The major component of KEGG is the PATHWAY database that consists of graphical diagrams of biochemical pathways including most of the known metabolic pathways and some of the known regulatory pathways. The pathway information is also represented by the ortholog group tables summarizing orthologous and paralogous gene groups among different organisms. KEGG maintains the GENES database for the gene catalogs of all organisms with complete genomes and selected organisms with partial genomes, which are continuously re-annotated, as well as the LIGAND database for chemical compounds and enzymes. Each gene catalog is associated with the graphical genome map for chromosomal locations that is represented by Java applet. In addition to the data collection efforts, KEGG develops and provides various computational tools, such as for reconstructing biochemical pathways from the complete genome sequence and for predicting gene regulatory networks from the gene expression profiles. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/).
Chromosome specific databases are an important research tool as they integrate data from different directions, such as genetic and physical mapping data, expression data, sequences etc. They supplement the genome-wide repositories in molecular biology, such as GenBank, Swiss-Prot or OMIM, which usually concentrate on one type of information. The Integrated X Chromosome Database (IXDB, http://ixdb.mpimgberlin-dahlem.mpg.de/ ) is a repository for physical mapping data of the human X chromosome and aims at providing a global view of genomic data at a chromosomal level. We present here an update of IXDB which includes schema extensions for storing submaps and sequence information, additional links to external databases, and the integration of an increasing number of physical and transcript mapping data. The gene data was completely updated according to the approved gene symbols of the HUGO Nomenclature Committee. IXDB receives over 1000 queries per month, an indication that its content is valuable to researchers seeking mapping data of the human X chromosome.
TRANSFAC is a database on transcription factors, their genomic binding sites and DNA-binding profiles. In addition to being updated and extended by new features, it has been complemented now by a series of additional database modules. among them, modules which provide data about signal transduction pathways (TRANSPATH) or about cell types/organs/developmental stages (CYTOMER) are available as well as an updated version of the previously described compel database. the databases are available on the www at http://transfac.gbf.de/
The Antwerp database on large subunit ribosomal RNA now contains 607 complete or nearly complete aligned sequences. The alignment incorporates secondary structure information for each sequence. Other information about the sequences, such as literature references, accession numbers and taxonomic information is also available. Information from the database can be downloaded or searched on the rRNA www server at URL http://rrna.uia.ac.be/
The Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS-GSF), Martinsried near Munich, Germany, develops and maintains genome oriented databases. It is commonplace that the amount of sequence data available increases rapidly, but not the capacity of qualified manual annotation at the sequence databases. Therefore, our strategy aims to cope with the data stream by the comprehensive application of analysis tools to sequences of complete genomes, the systematic classification of protein sequences and the active support of sequence analysis and functional genomics projects. This report describes the systematic and up-to-date analysis of genomes (PEDANT), a comprehensive database of the yeast genome (MYGD), a database reflecting the progress in sequencing the Arabidopsis thaliana genome (MATD), the database of assembled, annotated human EST clusters (MEST), and the collection of protein sequence data within the framework of the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database (described elsewhere in this volume). MIPS provides access through its WWW server (http://www.mips.biochem.mpg.de) to a spectrum of generic databases, including the above mentioned as well as a database of protein families (PROTFAM), the MITOP database, and the all-against-all FASTA database.
Blocks are ungapped multiple sequence alignments representing conserved protein regions, and the Blocks Database consists of blocks from documented protein families. World Wide Web (http://www.blocks.fhcrc.org) and Email (blocks@blocks.fhcrc.org) servers provide tools for homology searching and for analyzing protein family relationships. New enhancements include a multiple alignment processor that extends the use of these tools to imported multiple alignments of families not present in the database and a PCR primer designer that implements a new strategy for gene isolation.
This paper presents the updated version of the data base of ribosomal 5S ribonucleic acids (5S rRNA) and their genes (5S rDNA). This edition of the data bank contains 1889 primary structures of 5S rRNA and 5S rDNA. These include 60 archaebacterial, 439 eubacterial, 63 plastid, 9 mitochondrial and 1318 eukaryotic sequences. The nucleotide sequences of 5S rRNAs or 5S rDNAs are divided according to the taxonomic position of organisms. The sequences stored in the database can be viewed and retrieved using the taxonomic browser at the URL: http://rose.man.poznan.pl/5SData/5SRNA.html
The HuGeMap database stores the major genetic and physical maps of the human genome. HuGeMap is accessible on the Web at http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/Hugemap and through a CORBA server. A standard genome map data format for the interconnection of genome map databases was defined in collaboration with the EBI. The HuGeMap CORBA server provides this interconnection using the interface definition language IDL. Two graphical user interfaces were developed for the visualization of the HuGeMap data: ZoomMap (http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/zomit/ZoomMap.html) for navigation by zooming and data transformation via magic lenses, and Mappet-Show (http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/Mappet) for visualizing and comparing maps.
The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (http//:www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) has developed a software system for mass submissions to cope with a recent expansion of EST and genome data submissions. The system is composed of four parts, the www data submission, large-scale submission, submission management and storing. Using this system one can submit data on a large number of sequences or a very long sequence while checking the consistency between the annotation and sequence without much effort. DDBJ has received large scale data of Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis and Pyrococcus from Japanese researchers who made full use of the new submission system.
Currently the protein mutant database (PMD) contains over 81 000 mutants, including artificial as well as natural mutants of various proteins extracted from about 10 000 articles. We recently developed a powerful viewing and retrieving system (http://pmd.ddbj.nig.ac.jp), which is integrated with the sequence and tertiary structure databases. The system has the following features: (i) mutated sequences are displayed after being automatically generated from the information described in the entry together with the sequence data of wild-type proteins integrated. This is a convenient feature because it allows one to see the position of altered amino acids (shown in a different color) in the entire sequence of a wild-type protein; (ii) for those proteins whose 3D structures have been experimentally determined, a 3D structure is displayed to show mutation sites in a different color; (iii) a sequence homology search against PMD can be carried out with any query sequence; (iv) a summary of mutations of homologous sequences can be displayed, which shows all the mutations at a certain site of a protein, recorded throughout the PMD.
The Olfactory Receptor Database (ORDB) is a WWW-accessible database that stores data on Olfactory Receptor-like molecules (ORs) and has been open to the public since June 1996. It contains a public and a private area. The public area includes published DNA and protein sequence data for ORs, links to OR models and data on their expression, chromosomal localization and source organism, as well as (i) links to bibliography through PubMed and (ii) interactive WWW-based tools, such as BLAST homology searching. The private area functions as a service to laboratories that are actively cloning receptors. Source laboratories enter the sequences of the receptor clones they have characterized to the private database and can search for identical or near identical OR sequences in both public and private databases. If another laboratory has cloned and deposited an identical or closely matching sequence there are means for communication between the laboratories to help avoid duplication of work. ORDB is available via the WWW at http://crepe.med.yale.edu/ORDB/HTML
Ribonuclease P is responsible for the 5′-maturation of tRNA precursors. Ribonuclease P is a ribonucleoprotein, and in bacteria (and some Archaea) the RNA subunit alone is catalytically active in vitro, i.e. it is a ribozyme. The Ribonuclease P Database is a compilation of ribonuclease P sequences, sequence alignments, secondary structures, three-dimensional models and accessory information, available via the World Wide Web at the following URL: http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/RNaseP/home.html
The PRESAGE database is a collaborative resource for structural genomics. It provides a database of proteins to which researchers add annotations indicating current experimental status, structural predictions and suggestions. The database is intended to enhance communication among structural genomics researchers and aid dissemination of their results. The PRESAGE database may be accessed at http://presage.stanford.edu/
HUGE is a database for human large proteins newly identified by Kazusa cDNA project, which aims to predict protein primary structures from sequences of human large cDNAs (>4 kb). In particular, cDNA clones capable of coding for large proteins (>50 kDa) are current targets of the project. More than 700 sequences of human cDNAs (average size, 5.1 kb) have been determined to date and deposited in the public databases. Notable information implied from the cDNAs and the predicted protein sequences can be obtained through HUGE via the World Wide Web at URL http://www.kazusa.or.jp/huge
Frequencies for each of the 206 526 complete protein-coding genes (CDS's) have been compiled from taxonomical divisions of the GenBank DNA sequence database. The sum of the codon use of 7434 organisms has also been calculated. These data files can be obtained from anonymous ftp sites of DDBJ, DISC and EBI. The list of the codon usage of genes in an organism as well as the sum of the codon usage of the organism was made searchable by the name of organism through a web site http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/~nakamura/CUTG.html
The Protein Information Resource (PIR) has been maintaining a database of curated protein sequence alignments since 1991. the collection includes superfamily, family and homology domain alignments. CLUSTAL V/W is used to generate multiple sequence alignments and ALNED, an interactive alignment editor, is used to check and correct them. the database has helped in classifying sequences, in defining new homology domains, and in spreading and standardizing protein names, features and Keywords among members of a family or superfamily. The ATLAS information retrieval system can be used to browse and query the PIR-ALN alignments. the quarterly and weekly updates can be accessed via the WWW at http://www-nbrf.georgetown.edu/pir/
Since July 1995, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) has maintained the Radiation Hybrid database (RHdb; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/RHdb), a public database for radiation hybrid data. Radiation hybrid mapping is an important technique for determining high resolution maps. Recently, CORBA access has been added to RHdb. The EBI is an Outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).
COMPEL is a database on composite regulatory elements, the basic structures of combinatorial regulation. Composite regulatory elements contain two closely situated binding sites for distinct transcription factors and represent minimal functional units providing combinatorial transcriptional regulation. Both specific factor–DNA and factor–factor interactions contribute to the function of composite elements (CEs). Information about the structure of known CEs and specific gene regulation achieved through such CEs appears to be extremely useful for promoter prediction, for gene function prediction and for applied gene engineering as well. The structure of the relational model of COMPEL is determined by the concept of molecular structure and regulatory role of CEs. Based on the set of a particular CE, a program has been developed for searching potential CEs in gene regulatory regions. WWW search and browse routines were developed for COMPEL release 3.0. The COMPEL database equipped with the search and browse tools is available at http://compel.bionet.nsc.ru/ . The program for prediction of potential CEs of NFAT type is available at http://compel.bionet.nsc.ru/FunSite.html and http://transfac.gbf.de/dbsearch/funsitep/s_comp.html 
The ASTRAL compendium provides several databases and tools to aid in the analysis of protein structures, particularly through the use of their sequences. The SPACI scores included in the system summarize the overall characteristics of a protein structure. A structural alignments database indicates residue equivalencies in superimposed protein domain structures. The PDB sequence-map files provide a linkage between the amino acid sequence of the molecule studied (SEQRES records in a database entry) and the sequence of the atoms experimentally observed in the structure (ATOM records). These maps are combined with information in the SCOP database to provide sequences of protein domains. Selected subsets of the domain database, with varying degrees of similarity measured in several different ways, are also available. ASTRALmay be accessed at http://astral.stanford.edu/
The HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database is an online relational database that catalogs evolutionary and drug-related human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease sequence variation (http://hivdb.stanford.edu ). The database contains a compilation of nearly all published HIV RT and protease sequences including International Collaboration database submissions (e.g., GenBank) and sequences published in journal articles. Sequences are linked to data about the source of the sequence sample and the antiretroviral drug treatment history of the individual from whom the isolate was obtained. The database is curated and sequences are annotated with data from >230 literature references. Users can retrieve additional data and view alignments of sequence sets meeting specific criteria (e.g., treatment history, subtype, presence of a particular mutation). A gene-specific sequence analysis program, new user-defined queries and nearly 2000 additional sequences were added in 1999.
The Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/ ) is the single worldwide archive of structural data of biological macromolecules.

This edition of the database contains 1985primary structures of 5S rRNA and 5S rDNA. They include 60 archaebacterial, 470 eubacterial, 63 plastid, nine mitochondrial and 1383 eukaryotic sequences. The nucleotide sequences of the 5S rRNAs or 5S rDNAs are divided according to the taxonomic position of the source organisms.
The DBcat (http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/dbcat ) is a comprehensive catalog of biological databases, maintained and curated at Infobiogen. It contains 500 databases classified by application domains. The DBcat is a structured flat-file library, that can be searched by means of an SRS server or a dedicated Web interface. The files are available for download from Infobiogen anonymous ftp server.
The GenBank® sequence database incorporates publicly available DNA sequences of >55 000 different organisms, primarily through direct submission of sequence data from individual laboratories and large-scale sequencing projects. Most submissions are made using the BankIt (Web) or Sequin programs and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank staff upon receipt. Data exchange with the EMBL Data Library and the DNA Data Bank of Japan helps ensure comprehensive worldwide coverage. GenBank data is accessible through NCBI’s integrated retrieval system, Entrez, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping and protein structure information, plus the biomedical literature via PubMed. Sequence similarity searching is provided by the BLAST family of programs. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. NCBI also offers a wide range of WWW retrieval and analysis services based on GenBank data. The GenBank database and related resources are freely accessible via the NCBI home page at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov 
FIMM database (http://sdmc.krdl.org.sg:8080/fimm ) contains data relevant to functional molecular immun­ology, focusing on cellular immunology. It contains fully referenced data on protein antigens, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, MHC-associated peptides and relevant disease associations. FIMM has a set of search tools for extraction of information and results are presented as lists or as reports.
The Rice Genome Research Program (RGP) launched a large-scale rice genome sequencing in 1998 aimed at decoding all genetic information in rice. A new genome database called INE (INtegrated rice genome Explorer) has been developed in order to integrate all the genomic information that has been accumulated so far and to correlate these data with the genome sequence. A web interface based on Java applet provides a rapid viewing capability in the database. The first operational version of the database has been completed which includes a genetic map, a physical map using YAC (Yeast Artificial Chromosome) clones and PAC (P1-derived Artificial Chromosome) contigs. These maps are displayed graphically so that the positional relationships among the mapped markers on each chromosome can be easily resolved. INE incorporates the sequences and annotations of the PAC contig. A site on low quality information ensures that all submitted sequence data comply with the standard for accuracy. As a repository of rice genome sequence, INE will also serve as a common database of all sequence data obtained by collaborating members of the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP). The database can be accessed at http://www. dna.affrc.go.jp:82/giot/INE.html or its mirror site at http://www.staff.or.jp/giot/INE.html
Using a novel multipurpose mini-transposon, we have generated a collection of defined mutant alleles for the analysis of disruption phenotypes, protein localization, and gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To catalog this unique data set, we have developed TRIPLES, a Web-accessible database of TRansposon-Insertion Phenotypes, Localization and Expression in Saccharomyces. Encompassing over 250 000 data points, TRIPLES provides convenient access to information from nearly 7800 transposon-mutagenized yeast strains; within TRIPLES, complete data reports of each strain may be viewed in table format, or if desired, downloaded as tab-delimited text files. Each report contains external links to corresponding entries within the Saccharomyces Genome Database and International Nucleic Acid Sequence Data Library (GenBank). Unlike other yeast databases, TRIPLES also provides on-line order forms linked to each clone report; users may immediately request any desired strain free-of-charge by submitting a completed form. In addition to presenting a wealth of information for over 2300 open reading frames, TRIPLES constitutes an important medium for the distribution of useful reagents throughout the yeast scientific community. Maintained by the Yale Genome Analysis Center, TRIPLES may be accessed at http://ycmi.med.yale.edu/ygac/triples.htm 
Pfam is a large collection of protein multiple sequence alignments and profile hidden Markov models. Pfam is available on the WWW in the UK at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/ , in Sweden at http://www.cgr.ki.se/Pfam/ and in the US at http://pfam.wustl.edu/ . The latest version (4.3) of Pfam contains 1815 families. These Pfam families match 63% of proteins in SWISS-PROT 37 and TrEMBL 9. For complete genomes Pfam currently matches up to half of the proteins. Genomic DNA can be directly searched against the Pfam library using the Wise2 package.
The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS) are a diverse group of enzymes that ensure the fidelity of transfer of genetic information from DNA into protein. They catalyse the attachment of amino acids to transfer RNAs and thereby establish the rules of the genetic code by virtue of matching the nucleotide triplet of the anticodon with its cognate amino acid. Currently, 818 AARS primary structures have been reported from archaebacteria, eubacteria, mitochondria, chloro­plasts and eukaryotic cells. The database is a compil­ation of the amino acid sequences of all AARSs, known to date, which are available as separate entries or alignments of related proteins via the WWW at http://rose.man.poznan.pl/aars/index.html 
REBASE is a comprehensive database of information about restriction enzymes and related proteins. It contains published and unpublished references, recognition and cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. DNA methyltransferases, homing endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control proteins are also included. Most recently, putative DNA methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis of genomic sequences, are also listed. The data is distributed via Email, ftp (ftp.neb.com), and the Web (http://rebase.neb.com ).
Three-dimensional structures are now known for roughly half of all protein families. It is thus quite likely, in searching sequence databases, that one will encounter a homolog with known structure and be able to use this information to infer structure–function properties. The goal of Entrez’s 3D structure database is to make this information accessible and useful to molecular biologists. To this end, Entrez’s search engine provides three powerful features: (i) Links between databases; one may search by term matching in Medline®, for example, and link to 3D structures reported in these articles. (ii) Sequence and structure neighbors; one may select all sequences similar to one of interest, for example, and link to any known 3D structures. (iii) Sequence and structure visualization; identifying a homolog with known structure, one may view a combined molecular-graphic and alignment display, to infer approximate 3D structure. Entrez’s MMDB (Molecular Modeling DataBase) may be accessed at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/structure.html 
To aid studies of molecular evolution and to assist in gene prediction research, we have constructed an Exon–Intron Database (EID) in FASTA format. Currently, the database is derived from GenBank release 112, and it contains 51 289 protein-coding genes (287 209 exons) that harbor introns, along with extensive descriptions of each gene and its DNA and protein sequences, as well as splice motif information. There is 17% redundancy inherited from GenBank—a purge at the 99% identity level reduced the database to 42 460 genes (243 589 exons). We have created subdatabases of genes whose intron positions have been experimentally determined. One such database, constructed by comparing genomic and mRNA sequences, contains 11 242 genes (62 474 exons). A larger database of 22 196 genes (105 595 exons) was constructed by selecting on keywords to eliminate computer-predicted genes. By examining the two nucleotides adjacent to the intron boundary, we infer that there is a 2% rate of errors or other deviations from the standard GT…AG motif in nuclear genes. This criterion can be used to eliminate 4921 genes from the overall database. Various tools are provided to enable generation of user-specific subsets of the EID. The EID distribution can be obtained from http://mcb.harvard.edu/gilbert/EID
The Kabat Database was initially started in 1970 to determine the combining site of antibodies based on the available amino acid sequences at that time. Bence Jones proteins, mostly from human, were aligned, using the now-known Kabat numbering system, and a quantitative measure, variability, was calculated for every position. Three peaks, at positions 24–34, 50–56 and 89–97, were identified and proposed to form the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of light chains. Subsequently, antibody heavy chain amino acid sequences were also aligned using a different numbering system, since the locations of their CDRs (31–35B, 50–65 and 95–102) are different from those of the light chains. CDRL1 starts right after the first invariant Cys 23 of light chains, while CDRH1 is eight amino acid residues away from the first invariant Cys 22 of heavy chains. During the past 30 years, the Kabat database has grown to include nucleotide sequences, sequences of T cell receptors for antigens (TCR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules and other proteins of immunological interest. It has been used extensively by immunologists to derive useful structural and functional information from the primary sequences of these proteins. An overall view of the Kabat Database and its various applications are summarized here. The Kabat Database is freely available at http://immuno.bme.nwu.edu
The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Nucleotide Sequence Database (http://www.ebi.ac. uk/embl/index.html ) is maintained at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) in an international collaboration with the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and GenBank (USA). Data is exchanged amongst the collaborative databases on a daily basis. The major contributors to the EMBL database are individual authors and genome project groups. WEBIN is the preferred web-based submission system for individual submitters, whilst automatic procedures allow incorporation of sequence data from large-scale genome sequencing centres and from the European Patent Office (EPO). Database releases are produced quarterly. Network services allow free access to the most up-to-date data collection via Internet and WWW interfaces. EBI’s Sequence Retrieval System (SRS) is a network browser for databanks in molecular biology, integrating and linking the main nucleotide and protein databases plus many specialised databases. For sequence similarity searching a variety of tools (e.g., BLITZ, FASTA, BLAST) are available which allow external users to compare their own sequences against the most currently available data in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database and SWISS-PROT.
The 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs may play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression controlling mRNA localization, stability and translational efficiency. For this reason we developed UTRdb, a specialized database of 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs cleaned from redundancy. UTRdb entries are enriched with specialized information not present in the primary databases including the presence of nucleotide sequence patterns already demonstrated by experimental analysis to have some functional role. All these patterns have been collected in the UTRsite database so that it is possible to search any input sequence for the presence of annotated functional motifs. Furthermore, UTRdb entries have been annotated for the presence of repetitive elements. All internet resources implemented for retrieval and functional analysis of 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs are accessible at http://bigarea.area.ba.cnr.it:8000/EmbIT/UTRHome/ 
Version 2.1 of ASDB (Alternative Splicing Data Base) contains 1922 protein and 2486 DNA sequences. The protein entries from SWISS-PROT are joined into clusters corresponding to alternatively spliced variants of one gene. The DNA division consists of complete genes with alternative splicing mentioned or annotated in GenBank. The search engine allows one to search over SWISS-PROT and GenBank fields and then follow the links to all variants. The database can be assessed at the URL http://cbcg.nersc.gov/asdb 
Since July 1995, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) has maintained RHdb (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/RHdb ), a public database for radiation hybrid data. Radiation hybrid mapping is an important technique for determining high resolution maps. RHdb is also served by CORBA servers. The EBI is an Outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).
It is now clear that the homeobox motif is well conserved across metazoan phyla. It has been established experimentally that a subset of genes containing this motif plays key roles in the orchestration of gene expression during development. Auto- and cross-regulatory functional interactions join homeobox genes into genetic networks. We have developed a specialized database HOX-Pro in order to arrange all available data on structure, function, phylogeny and evolution of Hox genes, Hox clusters and Hox networks. Its primary location is http://www.iephb.nw.ru/hoxpro . The database is also mirrored at http://www.mssm.edu/molbio/hoxpro . The HOX-Pro database is aimed at: (i) analysis and classification of regulatory and coding regions in diverse homeobox and related genes; (ii) comparative analysis of organization of ‘Hox-based’ genetic networks in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the mouse Mus musculus; and (iii) analysis of phylo­geny and evolution of homeobox genes and clusters.
The PRINTS database houses a collection of protein family fingerprints. These are groups of motifs that together are diagnostically more potent than single motifs by virtue of the biological context afforded by matching motif neighbours. Around 1200 fingerprints have now been created and stored in the database. The September 1999 release (version 24.0) encodes ~7200 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides and so on. In addition to its continued steady growth, we report here several major changes to the resource, including the design of an automated strategy for database maintenance, and implementation of an object-relational schema for more efficient data management. The database is accessible for BLAST, fingerprint and text searches at http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/dbbrowser/PRINTS/ 
The European Large Subunit (LSU) Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) database is accessible via the rRNA WWW Server at URL http://rrna.uia.ac.be/lsu/ . It is a curated database that compiles complete or nearly complete LSU rRNA sequences in aligned form, and also incorporates secondary structure information for each sequence. Taxonomic information, literature references and other information about the sequences are also available, and can be searched via the WWW interface.
The RESID Database contains supplemental information on post-translational modifications for the standardized annotations appearing in the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database. The RESID Database includes: systematic and frequently observed alternate names, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers, atomic formulas and weights, enzyme activities, indicators for N-terminal, C-terminal or peptide chain cross-link modifications, keywords, literature citations with database cross-references, structural diagrams and molecular models. Since 1995 updates of the RESID Database have appeared as often as weekly, and full releases appear quarterly. The database is freely accessible through the PIR Web site http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/resid.html and by FTP.
XREFdb supports the investigation of protein function in the context of information available through work in multiple organisms. In addition to facilitating the association of functional data among known genes from multiple organisms, XREFdb has developed strategies that provide access to information associated with as-yet unstudied genes. The database organizes protein similarity and genetic map positional information from diverse sources in the public domain to facilitate investigator evaluation of potential functional signifi­cance. XREFdb is found at URL www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/XREFdb
BodyMap is a human and mouse gene expression database that has been maintained since 1993. It is based on site-directed 3′-ESTs collected from non-biased cDNA libraries constructed at Osaka University and contains >270 000 sequences from 60 human and 38 mouse tissues. The site-directed nature of the sequence tags allows unequivocal grouping of tags representing the same transcript and provides abundance information for each transcript in different parts of the body. Our collection of ESTs was compared periodically with other public databases for cross referencing. The histological resolution of source tissues and unique cloning strategy that minimized cloning bias enabled BodyMap to support three unique mRNA based experiments in silico. First, the recurrence information for clones in each library provides a rough estimate of the mRNA composition of each source tissue. Second, a user can search the entire data set with nucleotide sequences or keywords to assess expression patterns of particular genes. Third, and most important, BodyMap allows a user to select genes that have a desired expression pattern in humans and mice. BodyMap is accessible through the WWW at http://bodymap.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp 
SWISS-PROT is a curated protein sequence database which strives to provide a high level of annotation (such as the description of the function of a protein, its domains structure, post-translational modifications, variants, etc.), a minimal level of redundancy and high level of integration with other databases. Recent developments of the database include format and content enhancements, cross-references to additional databases, new documentation files and improvements to TrEMBL, a computer-annotated supplement to SWISS-PROT. TrEMBL consists of entries in SWISS-PROT-like format derived from the translation of all coding sequences (CDSs) in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database, except the CDSs already included in SWISS-PROT. We also describe the Human Proteomics Initiative (HPI), a major project to annotate all known human sequences according to the quality standards of SWISS-PROT. SWISS-PROT is available at: http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/ and http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/ 
RegulonDB is a database on transcription regulation and operon organization in Escherichia coli. The current version describes regulatory signals of transcription initiation, promoters, regulatory binding sites of specific regulators, ribosome binding sites and terminators, as well as information on genes clustered in operons. These specific annotations have been gathered from a constant search in the literature, as well as based on computational sequence predictions. The genomic coordinates of all these objects in the E.coli K-12 chromosome are clearly indicated. Every known object has a link to at least one MEDLINE reference. We have also added direct links to recent expression data of E.coli K-12. The version presented here has important modifications both in the structure of the database, as well as in the amount and type of information encoded in the database. RegulonDB can be accessed on the web at URL: http://www.cifn.unam.mx/Computational_Biology/regulondb/ 
Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have provided a first glimpse of the collection of transcribed sequences in a variety of organisms. However, a careful analysis of this sequence data can provide significant additional functional, structural and evolutionary information. Our analysis of the public EST sequences, available through the TIGR Gene Indices (TGI; http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tdb.html ), is an attempt to identify the genes represented by that data and to provide additional information regarding those genes. Gene Indices are constructed for selected organisms by first clustering, then assembling EST and annotated gene sequences from GenBank. This process produces a set of unique, high-fidelity virtual transcripts, or tentative consensus (TC) sequences. The TC sequences can be used to provide putative genes with functional annotation, to link the transcripts to mapping and genomic sequence data, and to provide links between orthologous and paralogous genes.
The Yeast Proteome Database (YPD™) has been for several years a resource for organized and accessible information about the proteins of Saccharomycescerevisiae. We have now extended the YPD format to create a database containing complete proteome information about the model organism Caenorhabditiselegans (WormPD™). YPD and WormPD are designed for use not only by their respective research communities but also by the broader scientific community. In both databases, information gleaned from the literature is presented in a consistent, user-friendly Protein Report format: a single Web page presenting all available knowledge about a particular protein. Each Protein Report begins with a Title Line, a concise description of the function of that protein that is continually updated as curators review new literature. Properties and functions of the protein are presented in tabular form in the upper part of the Report, and free-text annotations organized by topic are presented in the lower part. Each Protein Report ends with a comprehensive reference list whose entries are linked to their MEDLINE abstracts. YPD and WormPD are seamlessly integrated, with extensive links between the species. They are freely accessible to academic users on the WWW at http://www.proteome.com/databases/index.html , and are available by subscription to corporate users.
We at DDBJ (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp ) process and publicise the massive amounts of data submitted mainly by Japanese genome projects and sequencing teams. It is emphasised that the collaboration between data producing teams and the data bank is crucial in carrying out these processes smoothly. The amount of data submitted in 1999 is so large that it alone exceeds the total amount submitted in the preceding 10 years. To cope with this situation, we have developed tools not only for processing such massive amounts of data but also for efficiently retrieving data on demand.
SELEX_DB is a novel curated database on selected randomized DNA/RNA sequences designed for accumulation of experimental data on functional site sequences obtained by using SELEX and SELEX-like technologies from the pools of random sequences. This database also contains the programs for DNA/RNA functional site recognition within arbitrary nucleotide sequences. The first release of SELEX_DB has been installed under SRS and is available through the WWW at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/systems/selex/ 
Human genome polymorphism is expected to play a key role in defining the etiologic basis of phenotypic differences between individuals in aspects such as drug responses and common disease predisposition. Relevant functional DNA changes will probably be located in or near to transcribed sequences, and include many single nucleotide polymorphisms. To aid the future analysis of such genome variation, HGBASE (Human Genic Bi-Allelic SEquences) was constructed as a means to gather human gene-linked polymorphisms from all possible public sources, and show these as a non-redundant set of records in a standardized and user-friendly database endowed with text and sequence based search facilities. After 1 year of presence on the WWW, the HGBASE project has compiled data for over 22 000 records, and this number continues to triple every 6–12 months with data harvested or submitted from all major public genome databases and published literature from the previous decade. Extensive annotation enhancement, internal consistency checking and manual review of every record is undertaken to address potential errors and deficiencies sometimes present in the original source data. The fully polished and comprehensive database is made freely available to all at http://hgbase.cgr.ki.se
The ProtoMap site offers an exhaustive classification of all proteins in the SWISS-PROT database, into groups of related proteins. The classification is based on analysis of all pairwise similarities among protein sequences. The analysis makes essential use of transitivity to identify homologies among proteins. Within each group of the classification, every two members are either directly or transitively related. However, transitivity is applied restrictively in order to prevent unrelated proteins from clustering together. The classification is done at different levels of confidence, and yields a hierarchical organization of all proteins. The resulting classification splits the protein space into well-defined groups of proteins, which are closely correlated with natural biological families and superfamilies. Many clusters contain protein sequences that are not classified by other databases. The hierarchical organization suggested by our analysis may help in detecting finer subfamilies in families of known proteins. In addition it brings forth interesting relationships between protein families, upon which local maps for the neighborhood of protein families can be sketched. The ProtoMap web server can be accessed at http://www.protomap.cs.huji.ac.il
The Prostate Expression Database (PEDB) is an online resource designed to access and analyze gene expression information derived from the human prostate. PEDB archives >55 000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from 43 cDNA libraries in a curated relational database that provides detailed library information including tissue source, library construction methods, sequence diversity and sequence abundance. The differential expression of each EST species can be viewed across all libraries using a Virtual Expression Analysis Tool (VEAT), a graphical user interface written in Java for intra- and inter-library species comparisons. Recent enhancements to PEDB include: (i) the functional categorization of annotated EST assemblies using a classification scheme developed at The Institute for Genome Research; (ii) catalogs of expressed genes in specific prostate tissue sources designated as transcriptomes; and (iii) the addition of prostate proteome information derived from two-dimensional electrophoreses and mass spectrometry of prostate cancer cell lines. PEDB may be accessed via the WWW at http://www.mbt.washington.edu/PEDB/ 
The Olfactory Receptor Database (ORDB) is a WWW-accessible database that has been expanded from an olfactory receptor resource to a chemoreceptor resource. It stores data on six classes of G-protein-coupled sensory chemoreceptors: (i) olfactory receptor-like proteins, (ii) vomeronasal receptors, (iii) insect olfactory receptors, (iv) worm chemo­receptors, (v) taste papilla receptors and (vi) fungal pheromone receptors. A complementary database of the ligands of these receptors (OdorDB) has been constructed and is publicly available in a pilot mode. The database schema of ORDB has been changed from traditional relational to EAV/CR (Entity-Attribute-Value with Classes and Relationships), which allows the interoperability of ORDB with other related databases as well as the creation of intra­database associations among objects. This inter­operability facilitates users to follow information from odor molecule binding to its putative receptor, to the properties of the neuron expressing the receptor, to a computational model of activity of olfactory bulb neurons. In addition, tools and resources have been added allowing users to access interactive phylogenetic trees and alignments of sensory chemoreceptors. ORDB is available via the WWW at http://ycmi.med.yale.edu/senselab/ordb/ 
TRANSFAC is a database on transcription factors, their genomic binding sites and DNA-binding profiles (http://transfac.gbf.de/TRANSFAC/ ). Its content has been enhanced, in particular by information about training sequences used for the construction of nucleotide matrices as well as by data on plant sites and factors. Moreover, TRANSFAC has been extended by two new modules: PathoDB provides data on pathologically relevant mutations in regulatory regions and transcription factor genes, whereas S/MARt DB compiles features of scaffold/matrix attached regions (S/MARs) and the proteins binding to them. Additionally, the databases TRANSPATH, about signal transduction, and CYTOMER, about organs and cell types, have been extended and are increasingly integrated with the TRANSFAC data sources.
The Blocks Database WWW (http://blocks.fhcrc.org ) and Email (blocks@blocks.fhcrc.org ) servers provide tools to search DNA and protein queries against the Blocks+ Database of multiple alignments, which represent conserved protein regions. Blocks+ nearly doubles the number of protein families included in the database by adding families from the Pfam-A, ProDom and Domo databases to those from PROSITE and PRINTS. Other new features include improved Block Searcher statistics, searching with NCBI’s IMPALA program and 3D display of blocks on PDB structures.
CyanoBase provides an online resource for access to data on genomic information about the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. The database contains annotations for each protein-coding gene deduced from the entire nucleotide sequence of the genome, gene classification lists, and keyword and similarity search engines. Core portions of CyanoBase consist of annotations for each of the 3168 protein genes deduced from the entire nucleotide sequence of this genome. The contents of each gene were improved by updating with the results of similarity searches and by introducing references for analysis in bioinformatics. The database now contains repository facilities that store and provide experimental information, in addition to providing proposals for the function of each gene. This information should help to avoid unnecessary, overlapping experiments and should assist communication between scientists who wish to elucidate the function of putative genes on the cyanobacteria genome. The current URL of CyanoBase is http://www.kazusa.or.jp:8080/cyano/ 
SWISS-2DPAGE (http://www.expasy.ch/ch2d/ ) is an annotated two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electro­phoresis (2-DE) database established in 1993. The current release contains 24 reference maps from human and mouse biological samples, as well as from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and Dictyostelium discoideum origin. These reference maps have now 2824 identified spots, corresponding to 614 separate protein entries in the database, in addition to virtual entries for each SWISS-PROT sequence or any user-entered amino acids sequence. Last year improvements in the SWISS-2DPAGE database are as follows: three new maps have been created and several others have been updated; cross-references to newly built federated 2-DE databases have been added; new functions to access the data have been provided through the ExPASy proteomics server.
Rational classification of proteins encoded in sequenced genomes is critical for making the genome sequences maximally useful for functional and evolutionary studies. The database of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) is an attempt on a phylogenetic classification of the proteins encoded in 21 complete genomes of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG ). The COGs were constructed by applying the criterion of consistency of genome-specific best hits to the results of an exhaustive comparison of all protein sequences from these genomes. The database comprises 2091 COGs that include 56–83% of the gene products from each of the complete bacterial and archaeal genomes and ~35% of those from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. The COG database is accompanied by the COGNITOR program that is used to fit new proteins into the COGs and can be applied to functional and phylogenetic annotation of newly sequenced genomes.
We have developed a publicly accessible database (ALFRED, the ALlele FREquency Database) that catalogues allele frequency data for a wide range of population samples and DNA polymorphisms. This database is web-accessible through our laboratory (Kidd Lab) Web site: http://info.med.yale.edu/genetics/kkidd . ALFRED currently contains data on 60 populations and 156 genetic systems including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs), variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) and insertion–deletion polymorphisms. While data are not available for all population–DNA polymorphism combinations, over 2000 allele frequency tables have been entered. Our database is designed (i) to address our specific research requirements as well as broader scientific objectives; (ii) to allow researchers and interested educators to easily navigate and retrieve data of interest to them; and (iii) to integrate links to other related public databases such as dbSNP, GenBank and PubMed.
The Intronerator (http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/~kent/intronerator/ ) is a set of web-based tools for exploring RNA splicing and gene structure in Caenorhabditis elegans. It includes a display of cDNA alignments with the genomic sequence, a catalog of alternatively spliced genes and a database of introns. The cDNA alignments include >100 000 ESTs and almost 1000 full-length cDNAs. ESTs from embryos and mixed stage animals as well as full-length cDNAs can be compared in the alignment display with each other and with predicted genes. The alt-splicing catalog includes 844 open reading frames for which there is evidence of alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. The intron database includes 28 478 introns, and can be searched for patterns near the splice junctions.
ProClass is a protein family database that organizes non-redundant sequence entries into families defined collectively by PIR superfamilies and PROSITE patterns. By combining global similarities and functional motifs into a single classification scheme, ProClass helps to reveal domain and family relationships and classify multi-domain proteins. The database currently consists of >155 000 sequence entries retrieved from both PIR-International and SWISS-PROT databases. Approximately 92 000 or 60% of the ProClass entries are classified into ~6000 families, including a large number of new members detected by our GeneFIND family identification system. The ProClass motif collection contains ~72 000 motif sequences and >1300 multiple alignments for all PROSITE patterns, including >21 000 matches not listed in PROSITE and mostly detected from unique PIR sequences. To maximize family information retrieval, the database provides links to various protein family, domain, alignment and structural class databases. With its high classification rate and comprehensive family relationships, ProClass can be used to support full-scale genomic annotation. The database, now being implemented in an object-relational database management system, is available for online sequence search and record retrieval from our WWW server at http://pir.georgetown.edu/gfserver/ proclass.html 
As the number of complete microbial genomes publicly available is still growing, the problem of annotation quality in these very large sequences remains unsolved. Indeed, the number of annotations associated with complete genomes is usually lower than those of the shorter entries encountered in the repository collections. Moreover, classical sequence database management systems have difficulties in handling entries of such size. In this context, the Enhanced Microbial Genomes Library (EMGLib) was developed to try to alleviate these problems. This library contains all the complete genomes from prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) already sequenced and the yeast genome in GenBank format. The annotations are improved by the introduction of data on codon usage, gene orientation on the chromosome and gene families. It is possible to access EMGLib through two database systems set up on WWW servers: the PBIL server at http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/emglib/emglib.html and the MICADO server at http://locus.jouy.inra.fr/micado 
The Phytophthora Genome Initiative (PGI) is a distributed collaboration to study the genome and evolution of a particularly destructive group of plant pathogenic oomycete, with the goal of understanding the mechanisms of infection and resistance. NCGR provides informatics support for the collaboration as well as a centralized data repository. In the pilot phase of the project, several investigators prepared Phytophthora infestans and Phytophthora sojae EST and Phytophthora sojae BAC libraries and sent them to another laboratory for sequencing. Data from sequencing reactions were transferred to NCGR for analysis and curation. An analysis pipeline transforms raw data by performing simple analyses (i.e., vector removal and similarity searching) that are stored and can be retrieved by investigators using a web browser. Here we describe the database and access tools, provide an overview of the data therein and outline future plans. This resource has provided a unique opportunity for the distributed, collaborative study of a genus from which relatively little sequence data are available. Results may lead to insight into how better to control these pathogens. The homepage of PGI can be accessed at http:www.ncgr.org/pgi , with database access through the database access hyperlink.
The Histone Database (HDB) is an annotated and searchable collection of all full-length sequences and structures of histone and non-histone proteins containing the histone fold motif. These sequences are both eukaryotic and archaeal in origin. Several new histone fold-containing proteins have been identified, including Spt7p, and a few false positives have been removed from the earlier version of HDB. Database contents include compilations of post-translational modifications for each of the core and linker histones, as well as genomic information in the form of map loci for the human histone gene complement, with the genetic loci linked to Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). Conflicts between similar sequence entries from a number of source databases are also documented. Newly added to the HDB are multiple sequence alignments in which predicted functions of histone fold amino acid residues are annotated. The database is freely accessible through the WWW at http://genome.nhgri.nih.gov/histones/
The University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (http://www.labmed.umn.edu/umbbd/ ) begins its fifth year having met its initial goals. It contains ~100 pathways for microbial catabolic metabolism of primarily xenobiotic organic compounds, including information on ~650 reactions, 600 compounds and 400 enzymes, and containing ~250 microorganism entries. It includes information on most known microbial catabolic reaction types and the organic functional groups they transform. Having reached its first goals, it is ready to move beyond them. It is poised to grow in many different ways, including mirror sites; fold prediction for its sequenced enzymes; closer ties to genome and microbial strain databases; and the prediction of biodegradation pathways for compounds it does not contain.
Mitochondria, besides their central role in energy metabolism, have recently been found to be involved in a number of basic processes of cell life and to contribute to the pathogenesis of many degenerative diseases. All functions of mitochondria depend on the interaction of nuclear and organellar genomes. Mitochondrial genomes have been extensively sequenced and analysed and the data collected in several specialised databases. In order to collect information on nuclear coded mitochondrial proteins we developed MitoNuc and MitoAln, two related databases containing, respectively, detailed information on sequenced nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial proteins in Metazoa and yeast, and the multiple alignments of the relevant homologous protein coding regions. MitoNuc and MitoAln retrieval through SRS at http://bio-www.ba.cnr.it:8000/srs6/ can easily allow the extraction of sequence data, subsequences defined by specific features and nucleotide or amino acid multiple alignments.
In addition to maintaining the GenBank® nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides data analysis and retrieval and resources that operate on the data in GenBank and a variety of other biological data made available through NCBI’s Web site.

The European database of the Small Subunit (SSU) Ribosomal RNA is a curated database that strives to collect all information about the primary and secondary structure of completely or nearly-completely sequenced rRNAs. Furthermore, the database compiles additional information such as literature references and taxonomic status of the organism the sequence was derived from. The database can be consulted via the WWW at URL http://rrna.uia.ac.be/ssu/ . Through the WWW, sequences can be easily selected either one by one, by taxonomic group, or by a combination of both, and can be retrieved in different sequence and alignment formats. 
The current version of PLMItRNA has been realized to constitute a database for tRNA molecules and genes identified in the mitochondria of all green plants (Viridiplantae). It is the enlargement of a previous database originally restricted to seed plants [Ceci,L.R., Volpicella,M., Liuni,S., Volpetti,V., Licciulli,F. and Gallerani,R. (1999) Nucleic Acids Res., 27, 156–157]. PLMItRNA reports information and multialignments on 254 genes and 16 tRNA molecules detected in 25 higher plants (one bryophyta and 24 vascular plants) and seven green algae. PLMItRNA is accessible via the WWW at http://bio-WWW.ba.cnr.it:8000/srs6/ 
SENTRA, available via URL http://wit.mcs.anl.gov/WIT2/Sentra/ , is a database of proteins associated with microbial signal transduction. The database currently includes the classical two-component signal transduction pathway proteins and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, but will be expanded to also include other classes of signal transduction systems that are modulated by phosphorylation or methylation reactions. Although the majority of database entries are from prokaryotic systems, eukaroytic proteins with bacterial-like signal transduction domains are also included. Currently SENTRA contains signal transduction proteins in 34 complete and almost completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes, as well as sequences from 243 organisms available in public databases (SWISS-PROT and EMBL). The analysis was carried out within the framework of the WIT2 system, which is designed and implemented to support genetic sequence analysis and comparative analysis of sequenced genomes.
The SYSTERS (short for SYSTEmatic Re-Searching) protein sequence cluster set consists of the classification of all sequences from SWISS-PROT and PIR into disjoint protein family clusters and hierarchically into superfamily and subfamily clusters. The cluster set can be searched with a sequence using the SSMAL search tool or a traditional database search tool like BLAST or FASTA. Additionally a multiple alignment is generated for each cluster and annotated with domain information from the Pfam database of protein domain families. A taxonomic overview of the organisms covered by a cluster is given based on the NCBI taxonomy. The cluster set is available for querying and browsing at http://www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/tbi/services/cluster/systersform 
The Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP; http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu ) is a database that documents experimentally determined protein–protein interactions. This database is intended to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive and integrated tool for browsing and efficiently extracting information about protein interactions and interaction networks in biological processes. Beyond cataloging details of protein–protein interactions, the DIP is useful for understanding protein function and protein–protein relationships, studying the properties of networks of interacting proteins, benchmarking predictions of protein–protein interactions, and studying the evolution of protein–protein interactions.
Important additions have been made to the MEROPS database (http://www.bi.bbsrc.ac.uk/Merops/Merops.htm ). These include sequence alignments and cladograms for many of the families of peptidases, and these have proved very helpful in the difficult task of distinguishing the sequences of peptidases that are simply species variants of already known enzymes from those that represent novel enzymes.
AAindex is a database of amino acid indices and amino acid mutation matrices. An amino acid index is a set of 20 numerical values representing various physico­-chemical and biochemical properties of amino acids. An amino acid mutation matrix is generally 20 × 20 numerical values representing similarity of amino acids. AAindex consists of two sections: AAindex1 for the collection of published amino acid indices and AAindex2 for the collection of published amino acid mutation matrices. Each entry of either AAindex1 or AAindex2 consists of the definition, the reference information, a list of related entries in terms of the correlation coefficient and the actual data. The database may be accessed through the DBGET/LinkDB system at GenomeNet (http://www.genome.ad.jp/aaindex/ ) or may be downloaded by anonymous FTP (ftp://ftp.genome.ad.jp/db/genomenet/aaindex/ ).
SMART (a Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) allows the identification and annotation of genetically mobile domains and the analysis of domain architectures (http://SMART.embl-heidelberg.de ). More than 400 domain families found in signalling, extra­cellular and chromatin-associated proteins are detectable. These domains are extensively annotated with respect to phyletic distributions, functional class, tertiary structures and functionally important residues. Each domain found in a non-redundant protein database as well as search parameters and taxonomic information are stored in a relational database system. User interfaces to this database allow searches for proteins containing specific combinations of domains in defined taxa.
The IMB Jena Image Library of Biological Macro­molecules (http://www.imb-jena.de/IMAGE.html ) is aimed at a better dissemination of information on three-dimensional biopolymer structures with an emphasis on visualization and analysis. It provides access to all structure entries deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Nucleic Acid Database (NDB). By combining automatic and manual processing it is possible to keep pace with the rapidly growing number of known biopolymer structures and to provide, for selected entries, information not available from automatic procedures. Each entry page contains basic information on the structure, various visualization and analysis tools as well as links to other databases. The visualization techniques adopted include static mono/stereo raster or vector graphics representations, virtual reality modeling (VRML), RasMol/Chime scripts and Java applets. A helix and bending analysis tool provides consistent information on about 750 DNA and RNA duplex structures. Access to metal-containing PDB entries is possible via the Periodic Table of Elements. Finally, general information on amino acids, cis-peptide bonds, structural elements in proteins, base pairs, nucleic acid model conformations and experimental methods for biopolymer structure determination is provided.
The Molecular Biology Database Collection represents an effort geared at making molecular biology database resources more accessible to biologists. This online resource, available at http://www.oup.co.uk/nar/Volume_28/Issue_01/html/gkd115_gml.html, is intended to serve as a searchable, up-to-date, centralized jumping-off point to individual Web sites. An emphasis has also been placed on including databases where new value is added to the underlying data by virtue of curation, new data connections, or other innovative approaches.
ModBase is a queryable database of annotated comparative protein structure models. The models are derived by ModPipe, an automated modeling pipeline relying on the programs PSI-BLAST and Modeller. The database currently contains 3D models for substantial portions of approximately 17 000 proteins from 10 complete genomes, including those of Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, as well as all the available sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana and Homo sapiens. The database also includes fold assignments and alignments on which the models were based. In addition, special care is taken to assess the quality of the models. ModBase is accessible through a web interface at http://guitar.rockefeller.edu/modbase/
This is an online database in order to facilitate research on viroid, viroid-like RNAs and human hepatitis delta virus by presenting a large number of sequences and related data in a comprehensive and user-friendly format (e.g., position of their self-catalytic domains, open reading frame, prediction of the most stable secondary structures, etc.). This online database is available on the WWW at http://www.callisto.si.usherb.ca/~jpperra 
The Database of Arabidopsis thaliana Annotation (DAtA) was created to enable easy access to and analysis of all the Arabidopsis genome project annotation. The database was constructed using the completed A.thaliana genomic sequence data currently in GenBank. An automated annotation process was used to predict coding sequences for GenBank records that do not include annotation. DAtA also contains protein motifs and protein similarities derived from searches of the proteins in DAtA with motif databases and the non-redundant protein database. The database is routinely updated to include new GenBank submissions for Arabidopsis genomic sequences and new Blast and protein motif search results. A web interface to DAtA allows coding sequences to be searched by name, comment, blast similarity or motif field. In addition, browse options present lists of either all the protein names or identified motifs present in the sequenced A.thaliana genome. The database can be accessed at http://baggage.stanford.edu/group/arabprotein/
Transterm facilitates studies of messenger RNAs and translational control signals. Each messenger RNA (mRNA) from GenBank is extracted and broken into its functional components, its coding sequence, initiation context, termination context, flanking sequence representing its 5′ UTR (untranslated region), 3′ UTR and translational signals. In addition, numerical parameters characterising each coding region in Transterm, including codon and GC bias, are available. For each species in Transterm, the initiation and termination regions are aligned by their start or stop codons and presented as base frequency matrices and tables of the information content of the bases in the alignments. Users can obtain summaries of characteristics of the mRNAs for species of their choice and search for translational signals both in the Transterm database and in their own sequence. The current release contains data from over 10 000 species, including the complete genomes of 20 prokaryotes and three eukaryotes. Both flat-file and relational database forms of Transterm are accessible via the WWW at http://biochem.otago. ac.nz/Transterm/ 
MITOP (http://www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/proj/medgen/ mitop/ ) is a comprehensive database for genetic and functional information on both nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins and their genes. The five species files—Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, Neurospora crassa and Homo sapiens—include annotated data derived from a variety of online resources and the literature. A wide spectrum of search facilities is given in the overlapping sections ‘Gene catalogues’, ‘Protein catalogues’, ‘Homologies’, ‘Pathways and metabolism’ and ‘Human disease catalogue’ including extensive references and hyperlinks to other databases. Central features are the results of various homology searches, which should facilitate the investigations into interspecies relationships. Precomputed FASTA searches using all the MITOP yeast protein entries and a list of the best human EST hits with graphical cluster alignments related to the yeast reference sequence are presented. The orthologue tables with cross-listings to all the protein entries for each species in MITOP have been expanded by adding the genomes of Rickettsia prowazeckii and Escherichia coli. To find new mitochondrial proteins the complete yeast genome has been analyzed using the MITOPROT program which identifies mitochondrial targeting sequences. The ‘Human disease catalogue’ contains tables with a total of 110 human diseases related to mitochondrial protein abnormalities, sorted by clinical criteria and age of onset. MITOP should contribute to the systematic genetic characterization of the mitochondrial proteome in relation to human disease.
The Gene Expression Database (GXD) is a community resource of gene expression information for the laboratory mouse. The database is designed as an open-ended system that can integrate different types of expression data. New expression data are made available on a daily basis. Thus, GXD provides increasingly complete information about what transcripts and proteins are produced by what genes; where, when and in what amounts these gene products are expressed; and how their expression varies in different mouse strains and mutants. GXD is integrated with the Mouse Genome Database (MGD). Continuously refined interconnections with sequence databases and with databases from other species place the gene expression information in the larger biological and analytical context. GXD is accessible through the Mouse Genome Informatics Web site at http://www. informatics.jax.org/ or directly at http://www.informatics. jax.org/menus/expression_menu.shtml 
The Genome Sequence DataBase (GSDB) is a database of publicly available nucleotide sequences and their associated biological and bibliographic information. Several notable changes have occurred in the past year: GSDB stopped accepting data submissions from researchers; ownership of data submitted to GSDB was transferred to GenBank; sequence analysis capabilities were expanded to include Smith–Waterman and Frame Search; and Sequence Viewer became available to Mac users. The content of GSDB remains up-to-date because publicly available data is acquired from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration databases (IC) on a nightly basis. This allows GSDB to continue providing researchers with the ability to analyze, query and retrieve nucleotide sequences in the database. GSDB and its related tools are freely accessible from the URL: http://www.ncgr.org
The frequencies of each of the 257 468 complete protein coding sequences (CDSs) have been compiled from the taxonomical divisions of the GenBank DNA sequence database. The sum of the codons used by 8792 organisms has also been calculated. The data files can be obtained from the anonymous ftp sites of DDBJ, Kazusa and EBI. A list of the codon usage of genes and the sum of the codons used by each organism can be obtained through the web site http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/ . The present study also reports recent developments on the WWW site. The new web interface provides data in the CodonFrequency-compatible format as well as in the traditional table format. The use of the database is facilitated by keyword based search analysis and the availability of codon usage tables for selected genes from each species. These new tools will provide users with the ability to further analyze for variations in codon usage among different genomes.
KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information. The genomic information is stored in the GENES database, which is a collection of gene catalogs for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ ).
LIGAND is a composite database comprising three sections: ENZYME for the information of enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions, COMPOUND for the information of metabolites and other chemical compounds, and REACTION for the collection of substrate–product relations. The current release includes 3390 enzymes, 5645 compounds and 5207 reactions. The database is indispensable for the reconstruction of metabolic pathways in the completely sequenced organisms. The LIGAND database can be accessed through the WWW (http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget/ligand.html ) or may be downloaded by anonymous FTP (ftp://kegg.genome.ad.jp/molecules/ligand/ ).
In last few years much data has accumulated on various non-translatable RNA transcripts that are synthesised in different cells. They are lacking in protein coding capacity and it seems that they work mainly or exclusively at the RNA level. All known non-coding RNA transcripts are collected in the database: http://www.man.poznan.pl/5SData/ncRNA/index.html 
Axeldb is a database storing and integrating gene expression patterns and DNA sequences identified in a large-scale in situ hybridization study in Xenopus laevis embryos. The data are organised in a format appropriate for comprehensive analysis, and enable comparison of images of expression pattern for any given set of genes. Information on literature, cDNA clones and their availability, nucleotide sequences, expression pattern and accompanying pictures are available. Current developments are aimed toward the interconnection with other databases and the integration of data from the literature. Axeldb is implemented using an ACEDB database system, and available through the web at  http://www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/abt0135/axeldb.htm 
A non-redundant database of nuclear, protein-encoding, genomic DNA sequences highlighting nuclear pre-mRNA introns was constructed using information contained in the SWISS-PROT and GenBank sequence databases. This Intron DataBase (IDB) contains information about (i) introns (including nucleotide sequence, location, phase, length, GC content and consensus-sequence rule violations), (ii) exons (including nucleo­tide sequence, length and GC content), (iii) protein coding regions (including amino acid sequence and length), and (iv) descriptive information about the source gene and organism (including gene designations and species taxonomy). The Intron Evolution DataBase (IEDB) provides a statistical analysis of the exon and intron sequences catalogued in IDB as well as data concerning intron penetration (relative number of coding regions with introns), density (number of introns per kb of total coding sequence DNA), distribution, and consensus sequences for each species present in IDB. This supplement is provided to furnish insights into the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of introns. Both databases are extensively cross-referenced to the SWISS-PROT and GenBank databases. IDB currently contains information on over 63 000 genes and 154 000 introns; IEDB summarizes information on over 2800 species. IDB and IEDB will be updated twice a year and are available via the internet (http://nutmeg.bio.indiana.edu/intron/index.html ).
The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) is an annotated non-redundant collection of eukaryotic POL II promoters for which the transcription start site has been determined experimentally. Access to promoter sequences is provided by pointers to positions in nucleotide sequence entries. The annotation part of an entry includes a description of the initiation site mapping data, exhaustive cross-references to the EMBL nucleotide sequence database, SWISS-PROT, TRANSFAC and other databases, as well as bibliographic references. EPD is structured in a way that facilitates dynamic extraction of biologically meaningful promoter subsets for comparative sequence analysis. WWW-based interfaces have been developed that enable the user to view EPD entries in different formats, to select and extract promoter sequences according to a variety of criteria, and to navigate to related databases exploiting different cross-references. The EPD web site also features yearly updated base frequency matrices for major eukaryotic promoter elements. EPD can be accessed at http://www.epd.isb-sib.ch 
Atomic resolution RNA structures are being published at an increasing rate. It is common to find a modest number of non-canonical base pairs in these structures in addition to the usual Watson–Crick pairs. This database summarizes the occurrence of these rare base pairs in accordance with standard nomenclature. The database, http://prion.bchs.uh.edu/ , contains infor-mation such as sequence context, sugar pucker conformation, anti/syn base conformations, chemical shift, pKa values, melting temperature and free energy. Of the 29 anticipated pairs with two or more hydrogen bonds, 20 have been encountered to date. In addition, four unexpected pairs with two hydrogen bonds have been reported bringing the total to 24. Single hydrogen bond versions of five of the expected geometries have been encountered among the single hydrogen bond interactions. In addition, 18 different types of base triplets have been encountered, each of which involves three to six hydrogen bonds. The vast majority of the rare base pairs are antiparallel with the bases in the anti configuration relative to the ribose. The most common are the GU wobble, the Sheared GA pair, the Reverse Hoogsteen pair and the GA imino pair.
ProDom contains all protein domain families automatically generated from the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL sequence databases (http://www.toulouse. inra.fr/prodom.html ). ProDom-CG results from a similar domain analysis as applied to completed genomes (http://www.toulouse.inra.fr/prodomCG.html ). Recent improvements to the ProDom database and its server include: scaling up to include sequences from TrEMBL, addition of Pfam-A entries to the set of expert validated families, assignment of stable accession numbers, consistency indicators for domain families, domain arrangements of sub-families and links to Pfam-A.
The Yeast Intron DataBase (YIDB) contains currently available information about all introns encoded in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Introns are divided according to their mechanism of excision: group I and group II introns, pre-mRNA introns, tRNA introns and the HAC1 intron. Information about the host genome, the type of RNA in which they are inserted and their primary structure are provided together with references. For nuclear pre-mRNA introns, transcription frequencies, as determined by microarray experiments, have also been included. This updated database is accessible at: http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/ExternalInfo/seraphin/yidb.html 
The WIT (What Is There) (http://wit.mcs.anl.gov/WIT2/ ) system has been designed to support comparative analysis of sequenced genomes and to generate metabolic reconstructions based on chromosomal sequences and metabolic modules from the EMP/MPW family of databases. This system contains data derived from about 40 completed or nearly completed genomes. Sequence homologies, various ORF-clustering algorithms, relative gene positions on the chromosome and placement of gene products in metabolic pathways (metabolic reconstruction) can be used for the assignment of gene functions and for development of overviews of genomes within WIT. The integration of a large number of phylogenetically diverse genomes in WIT facilitates the understanding of the physiology of different organisms.
The tmRNA database (tmRDB) is maintained at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler, Texas, and is accessible on the WWW at URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/tmRDB/tmRDB.html . A tmRDB mirror site is located on the campus of Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, reachable at the URL http://www.ag.auburn.edu/mirror/tmRDB/ . Since April 1997, the tmRDB has provided sequences of tmRNA (previously called 10Sa RNA), a molecule present in most bacteria and some organelles. This release adds 17 new sequences for a total of 60 tmRNAs. Sequences and corresponding tmRNA-encoded tag peptides are tabulated in alphabetical and phylo­genetic order. The updated tmRNA alignment improves the secondary structures of known tmRNAs on the level of individual basepairs. tmRDB also provides an introduction to tmRNA function in trans-translation (with links to relevant literature), a limited number of tmRNA secondary structure diagrams, and numerous three-dimensional models generated interactively with the program ERNA-3D.
In response to a need for a general catalog of genome variation to address the large-scale sampling designs required by association studies, gene mapping and evolutionary biology, the National Cancer for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has established the dbSNP database. Submissions to dbSNP will be integrated with other sources of information at NCBI such as GenBank, PubMed, LocusLink and the Human Genome Project data. The complete contents of dbSNP are available to the public at website: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP . Submitted SNPs can also be downloaded via anonymous FTP at ftp://ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/snp/ 
PseudoBase is a database containing structural, functional and sequence data related to RNA pseudo­knots. It can be reached at http://wwwbio.Leiden Univ.nl/~Batenburg/PKB.html . This page will direct the user to a retrieval page from where a particular pseudoknot can be chosen, or to a submission page which enables the user to add pseudoknot information to the database or to an informative page that elaborates on the various aspects of the database. For each pseudoknot, 12 items are stored, e.g. the nucleotides of the region that contains the pseudoknot, the stem positions of the pseudoknot, the EMBL accession number of the sequence that contains this pseudoknot and the support that can be given regarding the reliability of the pseudoknot. Access is via a small number of steps, using 16 different categories. The development process was done by applying the evolutionary methodology for software development rather than by applying the methodology of the classical waterfall model or the more modern spiral model.
InBase, the Intein Database (http://www.neb.com/neb/ inteins.html ), is a comprehensive on-line resource that includes the Intein Registry. Inteins are protein splicing elements that mediate a self-catalytic protein splicing reaction. InBase presents general information as well as detailed data for each intein, including tabu-lated comparisons and a comprehensive biblio­graphy.
The UK Crop Plant Bioinformatics Network (UK CropNet) was established in 1996 in order to harness the extensive work in genome mapping in crop plants in the UK. Since this date we have published five databases from our central UK CropNet WWW site (http://synteny.nott.ac.uk/ ) with a further three to follow shortly. Our resource facilitates the identification and manipulation of agronomically important genes by laying a foundation for comparative analysis among crop plants and model species. In addition, we have developed a number of software tools that facilitate the visualisation and analysis of our data. Many of our tools are made freely available for use with both crop plant data and with data from other species.
The AMmtDB database (http://bio-www.ba.cnr.it:8000/srs6/ ) has been updated by collecting the multi-aligned sequences of Chordata mitochondrial genes coding for proteins and tRNAs. The genes coding for proteins are multi-aligned based on the translated sequences and both the nucleotide and amino acid multi-alignments are provided. AMmtDB data selected through SRS can be viewed and managed using GeneDoc or other programs for the management of multi-aligned data depending on the user’s operative system. The multiple alignments have been produced with CLUSTALW and PILEUP programs and then carefully optimized manually.
The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) stores and organizes information about the nearly 6200 genes in the yeast genome. The information is organized around the ‘locus page’ and directs users to the detailed information they seek. SGD is endeavoring to integrate the existing information about yeast genes with the large volume of data generated by functional analyses that are beginning to appear in the literature and on web sites. New features will include searches of systematic analyses and Gene Summary Paragraphs that succinctly review the literature for each gene. In addition to current information, such as gene product and phenotype descriptions, the new locus page will also describe a gene product’s cellular process, function and localization using a controlled vocabulary developed in collaboration with two other model organism databases. We describe these developments in SGD through the newly reorganized locus page. The SGD is accessible via the WWW at http://genome-www. stanford. edu/Saccharomyces/

The present release contains >5500 entries, an ~67% increase over the previous version. In addition, we have included information about reversibility of data, details about buffer and ion concentrations and the surrounding residues in space for all mutants. A WWW interface enables users to search data based on various conditions with different sorting options for outputs. Further, ProTherm has links with other structural and literature databases, and the mutation sites and surrounding residues are automatically mapped on the structures and can be directly viewed through 3DinSight developed in our laboratory. The ProTherm database is freely available through the WWW at http://www.rtc.riken.go.jp/protherm.html 
The Mouse Tumor Biology Database (MTB) is a Web-based resource that provides access to information on tumor frequency and latency, genetics and pathology in genetically defined mice (transgenics, targeted mutations and inbred strains). MTB is designed to serve as an information resource for cancer genetics researchers who use the laboratory mouse as a model system for understanding human disease processes. Data in MTB are obtained from the primary scientific literature and direct submissions by the research community. MTB is accessible from the Mouse Genome Informatics Web site (http://www.informatics.jax.org ). User support is available for MTB via Email at mgi-help@informatics.jax.org
The Protein Information Resource (PIR) produces the largest, most comprehensive, annotated protein sequence database in the public domain, the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database, in collaboration with the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) and the Japan International Protein Sequence Database (JIPID). The expanded PIR WWW site allows sequence similarity and text searching of the Protein Sequence Database and auxiliary databases. Several new web-based search engines combine searches of sequence similarity and database annotation to facilitate the analysis and functional identification of proteins. New capabilities for searching the PIR sequence databases include annotation-sorted search, domain search, combined global and domain search, and interactive text searches. The PIR-International databases and search tools are accessible on the PIR WWW site at http://pir.georgetown.edu and at the MIPS WWW site at http://www.mips.biochem.mpg.de . The PIR-International Protein Sequence Database and other files are also available by FTP.
The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP-II), previously described by Maidak et al., continued during the past year to add new rRNA sequences to the aligned data and to improve the analysis commands. Release 7.1 (September 17, 1999) included more than 10 700 small subunit rRNA sequences. More than 850 type strain sequences were identified and added to the prokaryotic alignment, bringing the total number of type sequences to 3324 representing 2460 different species. Availability of an RDP-II mirror site in Japan is also near completion. RDP-II provides aligned and annotated rRNA sequences, derived phylogenetic trees and taxonomic hierarchies, and analysis services through its WWW server (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/ ). Analysis services include rRNA probe checking, approx­i­mate phylogenetic placement of user sequences, screening user sequences for possible chimeric rRNA sequences, automated alignment, production of similarity matrices and services to plan and analyze terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) experiments.
The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) is a comprehensive public database of mouse genomic, genetic and phenotypic information (http://www.informatics.jax.org ). This community database provides information about genes, serves as a mapping resource of the mouse genome, details mammalian orthologs, integrates experimental data, represents standardized mouse nomenclature for genes and alleles, incorporates links to other genomic resources such as sequence data, and includes a variety of additional information about the laboratory mouse. MGD scientists and annotators work cooperatively with the research community to provide an integrated, consensus view of the mouse genome while also providing experimental data including data conflicting with the consensus representation. Recent improvements focus on the representation of phenotypic information and the enhancement of gene and allele descriptions.
A database of mutations in human disease-causing genes has been constructed and named as Keio Mutation Database (KMDB). This KMDB utilizes a database software called MutationView which was designed to compile various mutation data and to provide graphical presentation of data analysis. Currently, the KMDB accommodates mutation data of 38 different genes for 35 different diseases which are involved in eye, heart, ear and brain. These KMDBs are accessible through http://mutview.dmb. med.keio.ac.jp with advanced internet browsers.
Zea mays DataBase (ZmDB) is a repository and analysis tool for sequence, expression and phenotype data of the major crop plant maize. The data accessible in ZmDB are mostly generated in a large collaborative project of maize gene discovery, sequencing and phenotypic analysis using a transposon tagging strategy and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing. ESTs constitute most of the current content. Database search tools, convenient links to external databases, and novel sequence analysis programs for spliced alignment are provided and together serve as an efficient protocol for gene discovery by sequence inspection. ZmDB can be accessed at http://zmdb. iastate.edu . ZmDB also provides web-based ordering of materials generated in the project, including EST and genomic DNA clones, seeds of mutant plants and microarrays of amplified EST and genomic DNA sequences.

MitBASE is an integrated and comprehensive database of mitochondrial DNA data which collects, under a single interface, databases for Plant, Vertebrate, Invertebrate, Human, Protist and Fungal mtDNA and a Pilot database on nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MitBASE reports all available information from different organisms and from intraspecies variants and mutants. Data have been drawn from the primary databases and from the literature; value adding information has been structured, e.g., editing information on protist mtDNA genomes, pathological information for human mtDNA variants, etc. The different databases, some of which are structured using commercial packages (Microsoft Access, File Maker Pro) while others use a flat-file format, have been integrated under ORACLE. Ad hoc retrieval systems have been devised for some of the above listed databases keeping into account their peculiarities. The database is resident at the EBI and is available at the following site: http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Research/Mitbase/mitbase.pl . The impact of this project is intended for both basic and applied research. The study of mitochondrial genetic diseases and mitochondrial DNA intraspecies diversity are key topics in several biotechnological fields. The database has been funded within the EU Biotechnology programme.
Transcription Regulatory Regions Database (TRRD) has been developed for accumulation of experimental information on the structure–function features of regulatory regions of eukaryotic genes. Each entry in TRRD corresponds to a particular gene and contains a description of structure–function features of its regulatory regions (transcription factor binding sites, promoters, enhancers, silencers, etc.) and gene expression regulation patterns. The current release, TRRD 4.2.5, comprises the description of 760 genes, 3403 expression patterns, and >4600 regulatory elements including 3604 transcription factor binding sites, 600 promoters and 152 enhancers. This information was obtained through annotation of 2537 scientific publications. TRRD 4.2.5 is available through the WWW at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/dbases/trrd4/ 
We report the latest release (version 1.6) of the CATH protein domains database (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath ). This is a hierarchical classification of 18 577 domains into evolutionary families and structural groupings. We have identified 1028 homo­logous superfamilies in which the proteins have both structural, and sequence or functional similarity. These can be further clustered into 672 fold groups and 35 distinct architectures. Recent developments of the database include the generation of 3D templates for recognising structural relatives in each fold group, which has led to significant improvements in the speed and accuracy of updating the database and also means that less manual validation is required. We also report the establishment of the CATH-PFDB (Protein Family Database), which associates 1D sequences with the 3D homologous superfamilies. Sequences showing identifiable homology to entries in CATH have been extracted from GenBank using PSI-BLAST. A CATH-PSIBLAST server has been established, which allows you to scan a new sequence against the database. The CATH Dictionary of Homologous Superfamilies (DHS), which contains validated multiple structural alignments annotated with consensus functional information for evolutionary protein superfamilies, has been updated to include annotations associated with sequence relatives identified in GenBank. The DHS is a powerful tool for considering the variation of functional properties within a given CATH superfamily and in deciding what functional properties may be reliably inherited by a newly identified relative.
EcoCyc is an organism-specific Pathway/Genome Database that describes the metabolic and signal-transduction pathways of Escherichia coli, its enzymes, and—a new addition—its transport proteins.

MAGEST is a database for newly identified maternal cDNAs of the ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, which aims to examine the population of the mRNAs. We have collected 3′ and 5′ tag sequences of mRNAs and their expression data from whole-mount in situ hybridi­zation in early embryos. To date, we have determined more than 2000 tag-sequences of H.roretzi cDNAs and input them into public databases. The tag sequences and the expression data as well as additional information can be obtained through MAGEST via the WWW at http://www.genome.ad.jp/magest/
ooTFD (object-oriented Transcription Factors Database) is an object-oriented successor to TFD. This database is aimed at capturing information regarding the polypeptide interactions which comprise and define the properties of transcription factors. ooTFD contains information about transcription factor binding sites, as well as composite relationships within transcription factors, which frequently occur as multisubunit proteins that form a complex interface to cellular processes outside the transcription machinery through protein–protein interactions. In the past year, a few additions and changes were made to this database and associated tools, which are accessible through the IFTI-MIRAGE web site at http://www.ifti.org/ 
The Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS-GSF), Martinsried, near Munich, Germany, continues its longstanding tradition to develop and maintain high quality curated genome databases. In addition, efforts have been intensified to cover the wealth of complete genome sequences in a systematic, comprehensive form. Bioinformatics, supporting national as well as European sequencing and functional analysis projects, has resulted in several up-to-date genome-oriented databases. This report describes growing databases reflecting the progress of sequencing the Arabidopsis thaliana (MATDB) and Neurospora crassa genomes (MNCDB), the yeast genome database (MYGD) extended by functional analysis data, the database of annotated human EST-clusters (HIB) and the database of the complete cDNA sequences from the DHGP (German Human Genome Project). It also contains information on the up-to-date database of complete genomes (PEDANT), the classification of protein sequences (ProtFam) and the collection of protein sequence data within the framework of the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database. These databases can be accessed through the MIPS WWW server (http://www. mips.biochem.mpg.de ).
The EcoGene database provides a set of gene and protein sequences derived from the genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12. EcoGene is a source of re-annotated sequences for the SWISS-PROT and Colibri databases. EcoGene is used for genetic and physical map compilations in collaboration with the Coli Genetic Stock Center. The EcoGene12 release includes 4293 genes. EcoGene12 differs from the GenBank annotation of the complete genome sequence in several ways, including (i) the revision of 706 predicted or confirmed gene start sites, (ii) the correction or hypothetical reconstruction of 61 frame-shifts caused by either sequence error or mutation, (iii) the reconstruction of 14 protein sequences interrupted by the insertion of IS elements, and (iv) pre-dictions that 92 genes are partially deleted gene fragments. A literature survey identified 717 proteins whose N-terminal amino acids have been verified by sequencing. 12 446 cross-references to 6835 literature citations and abstracts are provided. EcoGene is accessible at a new website: http://bmb.med.miami. edu/EcoGene/EcoWeb . Users can search and retrieve individual EcoGene GenePages or they can download large datasets for incorporation into database management systems, facilitating various genome-scale computational and functional analyses.
KinMutBase (http://www.uta.fi/imt/bioinfo/KinMutBase/ ) is a registry of mutations in human protein kinases related to disorders. Kinases are essential cellular signaling molecules, in which mutations can lead to diseases, including immunodeficiencies, cancers and endocrine disorders. The first release of KinMutBase contained information for protein tyrosine kinases. The current release includes also serine/threonine protein kinases, as well as an update of the tyrosine kinases. There are 251 entries altogether, representing 337 families and 621 patients. Mutations appear both in conserved hallmark residues of the kinases as well as in non-homologous sites. The KinMutBase WWW pages provide plenty of information, namely mutation statistics and display, clickable sequences with mutations and changes to restriction enzyme patterns.
The Exon/Intron (ExInt) database incorporates information on the exon/intron structure of eukaryotic genes. Features in the database include: intron nucleotide sequence, amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein, position of the introns at the amino acid level and intron phase. From ExInt, we have also generated four additional databases each with ExInt entries containing predicted introns, introns experimentally defined, organelle introns or nuclear introns. ExInt is accessible through a retrieval system with pointers to GenBank. The database can be searched by keywords, locus name, NID, accession number or length of the protein. ExInt is freely accessible at http://intron.bic.nus.edu.sg/exint/ exint.html 
The Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database provides a detailed and comprehensive description of the relationships of known protein structures. The classification is on hierarchical levels: the first two levels, family and superfamily, describe near and distant evolutionary relationships; the third, fold, describes geometrical relationships. The distinction between evolutionary relationships and those that arise from the physics and chemistry of proteins is a feature that is unique to this database so far. The sequences of proteins in SCOP provide the basis of the ASTRAL sequence libraries that can be used as a source of data to calibrate sequence search algorithms and for the generation of statistics on, or selections of, protein structures. Links can be made from SCOP to PDB-ISL: a library containing sequences homologous to proteins of known structure. Sequences of proteins of unknown structure can be matched to distantly related proteins of known structure by using pairwise sequence comparison methods to find homologues in PDB-ISL. The database and its associated files are freely accessible from a number of WWW sites mirrored from URL http://scop.mrc-lmb. cam.ac.uk/scop/ 
The Human BAC Ends database includes all non-redundant human BAC end sequences (BESs) generated by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), the University of Washington (UW) and California Institute of Technology (CalTech). It incorporates the available BAC mapping data from different genome centers and the annotation results of each end sequence for the contents of repeats, ESTs and STS markers. For each BAC end the database integrates the sequence, the phred quality scores, the map and the annotation, and provides links to sites of the library information, the reports of GenBank, dbGSS and GDB, and other relevant data. The database is freely accessible via the web and supports sequence or clone searches and anonymous FTP. The relevant sites and resources are described at http://www. tigr.org/tdb/humgen/bac_end_search/bac_end_intro.html 
The tmRNA Website collects all available tmRNA sequences into a single public resource, along with alignments and a guide to searching for new sequences. Over the last year, several sequences have been updated or newly found by monitoring ongoing genome sequencing projects; tmRNA sequence data from 70 species are now available. New features include: color-coding of sequences to mark suggested base-paired regions, a list of the literature concerning tmRNA, careful crediting of tmRNA sequence identifications, and a split browser window. Updates are very frequent. The tmRNA Website has a new URL: http:www.indiana.edu/~tmrna 
The ENZYME database is a repository of information related to the nomenclature of enzymes. In recent years it has became an indispensable resource for the development of metabolic databases. The current version contains information on 3705 enzymes. It is available through the ExPASy WWW server (http://www. expasy.ch/enzyme/ ).
ACTIVITY is a database on DNA/RNA site sequences with known activity magnitudes, measurement systems, sequence-activity relationships under fixed experimental conditions and procedures to adapt these relationships from one measurement system to another. This database deposits information on DNA/RNA affinities to proteins and cell nuclear extracts, cutting efficiencies, gene transcription activity, mRNA translation efficiencies, mutability and other biological activities of natural sites occurring within promoters, mRNA leaders, and other regulatory regions in pro- and eukaryotic genomes, their mutant forms and synthetic analogues. Since activity magnitudes are heavily system-dependent, the current version of ACTIVITY is supplemented by three novel sub-databases: (i) SYSTEM, measurement systems; (ii) KNOWLEDGE, sequence-activity relationships under fixed experimental conditions; and (iii) CROSS_TEST, procedures adapting a relationship from one measurement system to another. These databases are useful in molecular biology, pharmacogenetics, metabolic engineering, drug design and biotechnology. The databases can be queried using SRS and are available through the Web, http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/systems/Activity/.
The IMGT/HLA Database (www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/hla/) specialises in sequences of polymorphic genes of the HLA system, the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The HLA complex is located within the 6p21.3 region on the short arm of human chromosome 6 and contains more than 220 genes of diverse function. Many of the genes encode proteins of the immune system and these include the 21 highly polymorphic HLA genes, which influence the outcome of clinical transplantation and confer susceptibility to a wide range of non-infectious diseases. The database contains sequences for all HLA alleles officially recognised by the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System and provides users with online tools and facilities for their retrieval and analysis. These include allele reports, alignment tools and detailed descriptions of the source cells. The online IMGT/HLA submission tool allows both new and confirmatory sequences to be submitted directly to the WHO Nomenclature Committee. The latest version (release 1.7.0 July 2000) contains 1220 HLA alleles derived from over 2700 component sequences from the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases. The HLA database provides a model which will be extended to provide specialist databases for polymorphic MHC genes of other species.
The Ribosomal RNA Operon Copy Number Database (rrndb) is an Internet-accessible database containing annotated information on rRNA operon copy number among prokaryotes. Gene redundancy is uncommon in prokaryotic genomes, yet the rRNA genes can vary from one to as many as 15 copies. Despite the widespread use of 16S rRNA gene sequences for identification of prokaryotes, information on the number and sequence of individual rRNA genes in a genome is not readily accessible. In an attempt to understand the evolutionary implications of rRNA operon redundancy, we have created a phylogenetically arranged report on rRNA gene copy number for a diverse collection of prokaryotic microorganisms. Each entry (organism) in the rrndb contains detailed information linked directly to external websites including the Ribosomal Database Project, GenBank, PubMed and several culture collections. Data contained in the rrndb will be valuable to researchers investigating microbial ecology and evolution using 16S rRNA gene sequences. The rrndb web site is directly accessible on the WWW at http://rrndb.cme.msu.edu.
A novel database, under the acronym RISSC (Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Sequence Collection), has been created. It compiles more than 1600 entries of edited DNA sequence data from the 16S–23S ribosomal spacers present in most prokaryotes and organelles (e.g. mitochondria and chloroplasts) and is accessible through the Internet (http://ulises.umh.es/RISSC), where systematic searches for specific words can be conducted, as well as BLAST-type sequence searches. Additionally, a characteristic feature of this region, the presence/absence and nature of tRNA genes within the spacer, is included in all the entries, even when not previously indicated in the original database. All these combined features could provide a useful documen­tation tool for studies on evolution, identification, typing and strain characterization, among others.
A new thermodynamic database for normal and modified nucleic acids has been developed. This Thermodynamic Database for Nucleic Acids (NTDB) includes sequence, structure and thermodynamic information as well as experimental methods and conditions. In this release, there are 1851 sequences containing both normal and modified nucleic acids. A user-friendly web-based interface has been developed to allow data searching under different conditions. Useful thermodynamic tools for the study of nucleic acids have been collected and linked for easy usage. NTDB is available at http://ntdb.chem.cuhk.edu.hk.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) are at the center of the question of the origin of life. They constitute a family of enzymes integrating the two levels of cellular organization: nucleic acids and proteins. AARSs arose early in evolution and are believed to be a group of ancient proteins. They are responsible for attaching amino acid residues to their cognate tRNA molecules, which is the first step in the protein synthesis. The role they play in a living cell is essential for the precise deciphering of the genetic code. The analysis of AARSs evolutionary history was not possible for a long time due to a lack of a sufficiently large number of their amino acid sequences. The emerging picture of synthetases’ evolution is a result of recent achievements in genomics [Woese,C., Olsen,G.J., Ibba,M. and Söll,D. (2000) Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev., 64, 202–236]. In this paper we present a short introduction to the AARSs database. The updated database contains 1047 AARS primary structures from archaebacteria, eubacteria, mitochondria, chloroplasts and eukaryotic cells. It is the compilation of amino acid sequences of all AARSs known to date, which are available as separate entries via the WWW at http://biobases.ibch.poznan.pl/aars/ .
MetaFam is a comprehensive relational database of protein family information. This web-accessible resource integrates data from several primary sequence and secondary protein family databases. By pooling together the information from these disparate sources, MetaFam is able to provide the most complete protein family sets available. Users are able to explore the interrelationships among these primary and secondary databases using a powerful graphical visualization tool, MetaFamView. Additionally, users can identify corresponding sequence entries among the sequence databases, obtain a quick summary of corresponding families (and their sequence members) among the family databases, and even attempt to classify their own unassigned sequences. Hypertext links to the appropriate source databases are provided at every level of navigation. Global family database statistics and information are also provided. Public access to the data is available at http://metafam.ahc.umn.edu/.
One challenge presented by large-scale genome sequencing efforts is effective display of uniform information to the scientific community. The Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR) contains robust annotation of all complete microbial genomes and allows for a wide variety of data retrievals. The bacterial information has been placed on the Web at http://www.tigr.org/CMR for retrieval using standard web browsing technology. Retrievals can be based on protein properties such as molecular weight or hydrophobicity, GC-content, functional role assignments and taxonomy. The CMR also has special web-based tools to allow data mining using pre-run homology searches, whole genome dot-plots, batch downloading and traversal across genomes using a variety of datatypes.
The European Large Subunit Ribosomal RNA Database compiles all complete or nearly complete large subunit ribosomal RNA sequences available from public sequence databases. These are provided in aligned format and the secondary structure, as derived by comparative sequence analysis, is included. Additional information about the sequences such as literature references and taxonomic information is also included. The database is available from our WWW server at http://rrna.uia.ac.be/lsu/.
BAliBASE is specifically designed to serve as an evaluation resource to address all the problems encountered when aligning complete sequences. The database contains high quality, manually constructed multiple sequence alignments together with detailed annotations. The alignments are all based on three-dimensional structural superpositions, with the exception of the transmembrane sequences. The first release provided sets of reference alignments dealing with the problems of high variability, unequal repartition and large N/C-terminal extensions and internal insertions. Here we describe version 2.0 of the database, which incorporates three new reference sets of alignments containing structural repeats, trans­membrane sequences and circular permutations to evaluate the accuracy of detection/prediction and alignment of these complex sequences. BAliBASE can be viewed at the web site http://www-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/BioInfo/BAliBASE2/index.html or can be downloaded from ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/BAliBASE2/.
The Mendel database contains names for plant-wide families of sequenced plant genes. The names have either been approved by the Commission on Plant Gene Nomenclature (CPGN), an organization of the International Society for Plant Molecular Biology (ISPMB), or are identified as provisional or temporary names. Mendel also identifies the corresponding genes in individual species of plants. Mendel can be searched through the mirror sites at Cornell (http://genome.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/WebAce/webace?db=mendel) and Stanford (http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Mendel/). In addition, parts of Mendel can be downloaded from the CPGN Web site (http://mbclserver.rutgers.edu/CPGN/).
The CluSTr (Clusters of SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL proteins) database offers an automatic classification of SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL proteins into groups of related proteins. The clustering is based on analysis of all pairwise comparisons between protein sequences. Analysis has been carried out for different levels of protein similarity, yielding a hierarchical organisation of clusters. The database provides links to InterPro, which integrates information on protein families, domains and functional sites from PROSITE, PRINTS, Pfam and ProDom. Links to the InterPro graphical interface allow users to see at a glance whether proteins from the cluster share particular functional sites. CluSTr also provides cross-references to HSSP and PDB. The database is available for querying and browsing at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustr.
While genome sequencing projects are advancing rapidly, EST sequencing and analysis remains a primary research tool for the identification and categorization of gene sequences in a wide variety of species and an important resource for annotation of genomic sequence. The TIGR Gene Indices (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi.shtml) are a collection of species-specific databases that use a highly refined protocol to analyze EST sequences in an attempt to identify the genes represented by that data and to provide additional information regarding those genes. Gene Indices are constructed by first clustering, then assembling EST and annotated gene sequences from GenBank for the targeted species. This process produces a set of unique, high-fidelity virtual transcripts, or Tentative Consensus (TC) sequences. The TC sequences can be used to provide putative genes with functional annotation, to link the transcripts to mapping and genomic sequence data, to provide links between orthologous and paralogous genes and as a resource for comparative sequence analysis.
RegulonDB is a database on mechanisms of transcription regulation and operon organization in Escherichia coli K-12. The current version has considerably increased numbers of regulatory elements such as promoters, binding sites and terminators. The complete repertoire of known and predicted DNA-binding transcriptional regulators can be considered to be included in this version. The database now distinguishes different allosteric conformations of regulatory proteins indicating the one active in binding and regulating the different promoters. A new set of operon predictions has been incorporated. The relational design has been modified accordingly. Furthermore, a major improvement is a graphic display enabling browsing of the database with a Java-based graphic user interface with three zoom-levels connected to properties of each chromo­somal element. The purpose of these modifications is to make RegulonDB a useful tool and control set for tran­scriptome experiments. RegulonDB can be accessed on the web at the URL: http://www.cifn.unam.mx/Computational_Biology/regulondb/
Methylation of cytosine in the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring is a major modification of the DNA in most organisms. In eukaryotes, the distribution and number of 5-methylcytosines (5mC) along the DNA is heritable but can also change with the developmental state of the cell and as a response to modifications of the environment. While DNA methylation probably has a number of functions, scientific interest has recently focused on the gene silencing effect methylation can have in eukaryotic cells. In particular, the discovery of changes in the methylation level during cancer development has increased the interest in this field. In the past, a vast amount of data has been generated with different levels of resolution ranging from 5mC content of total DNA to the methylation status of single nucleotides. We present here a database for DNA methylation data that attempts to unify these results in a common resource. The database is accessible via WWW (http://www.methdb.de). It stores information about the origin of the investigated sample and the experimental procedure, and contains the DNA methylation data. Query masks allow for searching for 5mC content, species, tissue, gene, sex, phenotype, sequence ID and DNA type. The output lists all available information including the relative gene expression level. DNA methylation patterns and methylation profiles are shown both as a graphical representation and as G/A/T/C/5mC-sequences or tables with sequence positions and methylation levels, respectively.
IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics database, freely available at http://imgt.cines.fr:8104, was created in 1989 at the Université Montpellier II, CNRS, Mont­pellier, France, and is a high quality integrated information system specialising in immunoglobulins, T cell receptors and major histocompatibility complex molecules of human and other vertebrates. IMGT provides researchers and clinicians with a common access to all nucleotide, protein, genetic and structural immunogenetics data. This information is of high value for medical and veterinary research, biotechnology related to antibody and T cell receptor engineering, genome diversity and evolution studies of the immune response.
The iProClass database is an integrated resource that provides comprehensive family relationships and structural and functional features of proteins, with rich links to various databases. It is extended from ProClass, a protein family database that integrates PIR superfamilies and PROSITE motifs. The iProClass currently consists of more than 200 000 non-redundant PIR and SWISS-PROT proteins organized with more than 28 000 superfamilies, 2600 domains, 1300 motifs, 280 post-translational modification sites and links to more than 30 databases of protein families, structures, functions, genes, genomes, literature and taxonomy. Protein and family summary reports provide rich annotations, including membership information with length, taxonomy and keyword statistics, full family relationships, comprehensive enzyme and PDB cross-references and graphical feature display. The database facilitates classification-driven annotation for protein sequence databases and complete genomes, and supports structural and functional genomic research. The iProClass is implemented in Oracle 8i object-relational system and available for sequence search and report retrieval at http://pir.georgetown.edu/iproclass/ .
The database, called HyPaLib (for Hybrid Pattern Library), contains annotated structural elements characteristic for certain classes of structural and/or functional RNAs. These elements are described in a language specifically designed for this purpose. The language allows convenient specification of hybrid patterns, i.e. motifs consisting of sequence features and structural elements together with sequence similarity and thermodynamic constraints. We are currently developing software tools that allow a user to search sequence databases for any pattern in HyPaLib, thus providing functionality which is similar to PROSITE, but dedicated to the more complex patterns in RNA sequences. HyPaLib is available at http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/HyPa/.
The adenylate uridylate-rich elements (AREs) mediate the rapid turnover of mRNAs encoding proteins that regulate cellular growth and body response to exogenous agents such as microbes, inflammatory and environmental stimuli. However, the full repertoire of ARE-containing mRNAs is unknown. Here, we explore the distribution of AREs in human mRNA sequences. Computational derivation of a 13-bp ARE pattern was performed using multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitations (MEME) and consensus analyses. This pattern was statistically validated for the specificity towards the 3′-untranslated region and not coding region. The computationally derived ARE pattern is the basis of a database which contains non-redundant full-length ARE-mRNAs. The ARE-mRNA database (ARED; http://rc.kfshrc.edu.sa/ared) reveals that ARE-mRNAs encode a wide repertoire of functionally diverse proteins that belong to different biological processes and are important in several disease states. Cluster analysis was performed using the ARE sequences to demonstrate potential relationships between the type and number of ARE motifs, and the functional characteristics of the proteins.
The SWISS-PROT group at EBI has developed the Proteome Analysis Database utilising existing resources and providing comparative analysis of the predicted protein coding sequences of the complete genomes of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteome/). The two main projects used, InterPro and CluSTr, give a new perspective on families, domains and sites and cover 31–67% (InterPro statistics) of the proteins from each of the complete genomes. CluSTr covers the three complete eukaryotic genomes and the incomplete human genome data. The Proteome Analysis Database is accompanied by a program that has been designed to carry out InterPro proteome comparisons for any one proteome against any other one or more of the proteomes in the database.

ZFIN incorporates links to other genomic resources that provide sequence and ortholog data. Zebrafish nomenclature guidelines and an automated registration mechanism for new names are provided. Extensive usability testing has resulted in an easy to learn and use forms interface with complex searching capabilities.
The Medicago Genome Initiative (MGI) is a database of EST sequences of the model legume Medicago truncatula. The database is available to the public and has resulted from a collaborative research effort between the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation and the National Center for Genome Resources to investigate the genome of M.truncatula. MGI is part of the greater integrated Medicago functional genomics program at the Noble Foundation (http://www.noble.org ), which is taking a global approach in studying the genetic and biochemical events associated with the growth, development and environmental interactions of this model legume. Our approach will include: large-scale EST sequencing, gene expression profiling, the generation of M.truncatula activation-tagged and promoter trap insertion mutants, high-throughput metabolic profiling, and proteome studies. These multidisciplinary information pools will be interfaced with one another to provide scientists with an integrated, holistic set of tools to address fundamental questions pertaining to legume biology. The public interface to the MGI database can be accessed at http://www.ncgr.org/research/mgi.
The Protein Information Resource, in collaboration with the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) and the Japan International Protein Information Database (JIPID), produces the most comprehensive and expertly annotated protein sequence database in the public domain, the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database. To provide timely and high quality annotation and promote database interoperability, the PIR-International employs rule-based and classification-driven procedures based on controlled vocabulary and standard nomenclature and includes status tags to distinguish experimentally determined from predicted protein features. The database contains about 200 000 non-redundant protein sequences, which are classified into families and superfamilies and their domains and motifs identified. Entries are extensively cross-referenced to other sequence, classification, genome, structure and activity databases. The PIR web site features search engines that use sequence similarity and database annotation to facilitate the analysis and functional identification of proteins. The PIR-Inter­national databases and search tools are accessible on the PIR web site at http://pir.georgetown.edu/ and at the MIPS web site at http://www.mips.biochem.mpg.de. The PIR-International Protein Sequence Database and other files are also available by FTP.
Arabidopsis thaliana, a small annual plant belonging to the mustard family, is the subject of study by an estimated 7000 researchers around the world. In addition to the large body of genetic, physiological and biochemical data gathered for this plant, it will be the first higher plant genome to be completely sequenced, with completion expected at the end of the year 2000. The sequencing effort has been coordinated by an international collaboration, the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI). The rationale for intensive investigation of Arabidopsis is that it is an excellent model for higher plants. In order to maximize use of the knowledge gained about this plant, there is a need for a comprehensive database and information retrieval and analysis system that will provide user-friendly access to Arabidopsis information. This paper describes the initial steps we have taken toward realizing these goals in a project called The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (www.arabidopsis.org).
The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) is the community database resource for the laboratory mouse, a key model organism for interpreting the human genome and for understanding human biology and disease (http://www.informatics.jax.org). MGD provides standard nomenclature and consensus map positions for mouse genes and genetic markers; it provides a curated set of mammalian homology records, user-defined chromosomal maps, experimental data sets and the definitive mouse ‘gene to sequence’ reference set for the research community. The integration and standardization of these data sets facilitates the transition between mouse DNA sequence, gene and phenotype annotations. A recent focus on allele and phenotype representations enhances the ability of MGD to organize and present data for exploring the relationship between genotype and phenotype. This link between the genome and the biology of the mouse is especially important as phenotype information grows from large mutagenesis projects and genotype information grows from large-scale sequencing projects.
GlycoSuiteDB is a relational database that curates information from the scientific literature on glyco­protein derived glycan structures, their biological sources, the references in which the glycan was described and the methods used to determine the glycan structure. To date, the database includes most published O-linked oligosaccharides from the last 50 years and most N-linked oligosaccharides that were published in the 1990s. For each structure, information is available concerning the glycan type, linkage and anomeric configuration, mass and composition. Detailed information is also provided on native and recombinant sources, including tissue and/or cell type, cell line, strain and disease state. Where known, the proteins to which the glycan structures are attached are reported, and cross-references to the SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL protein sequence databases are given if applicable. The GlycoSuiteDB annotations include literature references which are linked to PubMed, and detailed information on the methods used to determine each glycan structure are noted to help the user assess the quality of the structural assignment. GlycoSuiteDB has a user-friendly web interface which allows the researcher to query the database using mono­isotopic or average mass, monosaccharide composition, glycosylation linkages (e.g. N- or O-linked), reducing terminal sugar, attached protein, taxonomy, tissue or cell type and GlycoSuiteDB accession number. Advanced queries using combinations of these parameters are also possible. GlycoSuiteDB can be accessed on the web at http://www.glycosuite.com.
The BioKnowledge Library is a relational database and web site (http://www.proteome.com) composed of protein-specific information collected from the scientific literature. Each Protein Report on the web site summarizes and displays published information about a single protein, including its biochemical function, role in the cell and in the whole organism, localization, mutant phenotype and genetic interactions, regulation, domains and motifs, interactions with other proteins and other relevant data. This report describes four species-specific volumes of the BioKnowledge Library, concerned with the model organisms Saccharo­myces cerevisiae (YPD), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (PombePD) and Caenorhabditis elegans (WormPD), and with the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (CalPD™). Protein Reports of each species are unified in format, easily searchable and extensively cross-referenced between species. The relevance of these comprehensively curated resources to analysis of proteins in other species is discussed, and is illustrated by a survey of model organism proteins that have similarity to human proteins involved in disease.
PromEC is an updated compilation of Escherichia coli mRNA promoter sequences. It includes documentation on the location of experimentally identified mRNA transcriptional start sites on the E.coli chromosome, as well as the actual sequences in the promoter region. The database was updated as of July 2000 and includes 472 entries. PromEC is accessible at http://bioinfo.md.huji.ac.il/marg/promec
The database of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs), which represents an attempt on a phylogenetic classification of the proteins encoded in complete genomes, currently consists of 2791 COGs including 45 350 proteins from 30 genomes of bacteria, archaea and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG). In addition, a supplement to the COGs is available, in which proteins encoded in the genomes of two multicellular eukaryotes, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and shared with bacteria and/or archaea were included. The new features added to the COG database include information pages with structural and functional details on each COG and literature references, improvements of the COGNITOR program that is used to fit new proteins into the COGs, and classification of genomes and COGs constructed by using principal component analysis.
High throughput genome (HTG) and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences are currently the most abundant nucleotide sequence classes in the public database. The large volume, high degree of fragmentation and lack of gene structure annotations prevent efficient and effective searches of HTG and EST data for protein sequence homologies by standard search methods. Here, we briefly describe three newly developed resources that should make discovery of interesting genes in these sequence classes easier in the future, especially to biologists not having access to a powerful local bioinformatics environment. trEST and trGEN are regularly regenerated databases of hypothetical protein sequences predicted from EST and HTG sequences, respectively. Hits is a web-based data retrieval and analysis system providing access to precomputed matches between protein sequences (including sequences from trEST and trGEN) and patterns and profiles from Prosite and Pfam. The three resources can be accessed via the Hits home page (http://hits.isb-sib.ch).
VIDA is a new virus database that organizes open reading frames (ORFs) from partial and complete genomic sequences from animal viruses. Currently VIDA includes all sequences from GenBank for Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae. The ORFs are organized into homologous protein families, which are identified on the basis of sequence similarity relationships. Conserved sequence regions of potential functional importance are identified and can be retrieved as sequence alignments. We use a controlled taxonomical and functional classification for all the proteins and protein families in the database. When available, protein structures that are related to the families have also been included. The database is available for online search and sequence information retrieval at http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/virus_database/VIDA.html.
In response to a need for a general catalog of genome variation to address the large-scale sampling designs required by association studies, gene mapping and evolutionary biology, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has established the dbSNP database [S.T.Sherry, M.Ward and K.Sirotkin (1999) Genome Res., 9, 677–679]. Submissions to dbSNP will be integrated with other sources of information at NCBI such as GenBank, PubMed, LocusLink and the Human Genome Project data. The complete contents of dbSNP are available to the public at website: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP. The complete contents of dbSNP can also be downloaded in multiple formats via anonymous FTP at ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/.
The Stanford Microarray Database (SMD) stores raw and normalized data from microarray experiments, and provides web interfaces for researchers to retrieve, analyze and visualize their data. The two immediate goals for SMD are to serve as a storage site for microarray data from ongoing research at Stanford University, and to facilitate the public dissemination of that data once published, or released by the researcher. Of paramount importance is the connection of microarray data with the biological data that pertains to the DNA deposited on the microarray (genes, clones etc.). SMD makes use of many public resources to connect expression information to the relevant biology, including SGD [Ball,C.A., Dolinski,K., Dwight,S.S., Harris,M.A., Issel-Tarver,L., Kasarskis,A., Scafe,C.R., Sherlock,G., Binkley,G., Jin,H. et al. (2000) Nucleic Acids Res., 28, 77–80], YPD and WormPD [Costanzo,M.C., Hogan,J.D., Cusick,M.E., Davis,B.P., Fancher,A.M., Hodges,P.E., Kondu,P., Lengieza,C., Lew-Smith,J.E., Lingner,C. et al. (2000) Nucleic Acids Res., 28, 73–76], Unigene [Wheeler,D.L., Chappey,C., Lash,A.E., Leipe,D.D., Madden,T.L., Schuler,G.D., Tatusova,T.A. and Rapp,B.A. (2000) Nucleic Acids Res., 28, 10–14], dbEST [Boguski,M.S., Lowe,T.M. and Tolstoshev,C.M. (1993) Nature Genet., 4, 332–333] and SWISS-PROT [Bairoch,A. and Apweiler,R. (2000) Nucleic Acids Res., 28, 45–48] and can be accessed at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/microarray.
Ligand-Gated Ion Channels (LGIC) are polymeric transmembrane proteins involved in the fast response to numerous neurotransmitters. All these receptors are formed by homologous subunits and the last two decades revealed an unexpected wealth of genes coding for these subunits. The Ligand-Gated Ion Channel database (LGICdb) has been developed to handle this increasing amount of data. The database aims to provide only one entry for each gene, containing annotated nucleic acid and protein sequences. The repository is carefully structured and the entries can be retrieved by various criteria. In addition to the sequences, the LGICdb provides multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic analyses and atomic coordinates when available. The database is accessible via the World Wide Web (http://www.pasteur.fr/recherche/banques/LGIC/LGIC.html), where it is continuously updated. The version 16 (September 2000) available for download contained 333 entries covering 34 species.
GenMapDB (http://genomics.med.upenn.edu/genmapdb) is a repository of human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones mapped by our laboratory to sequence-tagged site markers. Currently, GenMapDB contains over 3000 mapped clones that span 19 chromosomes, chromosomes 2, 4, 5, 9–22, X and Y. This database provides positional information about human BAC clones from the RPCI-11 human male BAC library. It also contains restriction fragment analysis data and end sequences of the clones. GenMapDB is freely available to the public. The main purpose of GenMapDB is to organize the mapping data and to allow the research community to search for mapped BAC clones that can be used in gene mapping studies and chromosomal mutation analysis projects.
Upon the completion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic sequence in 1996 [Goffeau,A. et al. (1997) Nature, 387, 5], several creative and ambitious projects have been initiated to explore the functions of gene products or gene expression on a genome-wide scale. To help researchers take advantage of these projects, the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) has created two new tools, Function Junction and Expression Connection. Together, the tools form a central resource for querying multiple large-scale analysis projects for data about individual genes. Function Junction provides information from diverse projects that shed light on the role a gene product plays in the cell, while Expression Connection delivers information produced by the ever-increasing number of microarray projects. WWW access to SGD is available at genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/.
The Dali Domain Dictionary (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/domain) is a numerical taxonomy of all known structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The taxonomy is derived fully automatically from measurements of structural, functional and sequence similarities. Here, we report the extension of the classification to match the traditional four hierarchical levels corresponding to: (i) supersecondary structural motifs (attractors in fold space), (ii) the topology of globular domains (fold types), (iii) remote homologues (functional families) and (iv) homologues with sequence identity above 25% (sequence families). The computational definitions of attractors and functional families are new. In September 2000, the Dali classification contained 10 531 PDB entries comprising 17 101 chains, which were partitioned into five attractor regions, 1375 fold types, 2582 functional families and 3724 domain sequence families. Sequence families were further associated with 99 582 unique homologous sequences in the HSSP database, which increases the number of effectively known structures several-fold. The resulting database contains the description of protein domain architecture, the definition of structural neighbours around each known structure, the definition of structurally conserved cores and a comprehensive library of explicit multiple alignments of distantly related protein families.
rSNP_Guide is a novel curated database system for analysis of transcription factor (TF) binding to target sequences in regulatory gene regions altered by mutations. It accumulates experimental data on naturally occurring site variants in regulatory gene regions and site-directed mutations. This database system also contains the web tools for SNP analysis, i.e., active applet applying weight matrices to predict the regulatory site candidates altered by a mutation. The current version of the rSNP_Guide is supplemented by six sub-databases: (i) rSNP_DB, on DNA–protein interaction caused by mutation; (ii) SYSTEM, on experimental systems; (iii) rSNP_BIB, on citations to original publications; (iv) SAMPLES, on experimentally identified sequences of known regulatory sites; (v) MATRIX, on weight matrices of known TF sites; (vi) rSNP_Report, on characteristic examples of successful rSNP_Tools implementation. These databases are useful for the analysis of natural SNPs and site-directed mutations. The databases are available through the Web, http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/systems/rsnp/.
The Identification and Classification of Bacteria (ICB) database (http:/www.mbio.co.jp/icb) contains currently available information about the DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) gene in bacteria. The database is designed to provide the scientific community with a reference point for using gyrB as an evolutionary and taxonomic marker. Nucleic and amino acid sequence data are currently available for over 850 strains, along with alignments at several different taxonomic levels and an exhaustive review of primer selection and background information.
GOBASE (http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/gobase/) is a network-accessible biological database, which is unique in bringing together diverse biological data on organelles with taxonomically broad coverage, and in furnishing data that have been exhaustively verified and completed by experts. So far, we have focused on mitochondrial data: GOBASE contains all published nucleotide and protein sequences encoded by mitochondrial genomes, selected RNA secondary structures of mitochondria-encoded molecules, genetic maps of completely sequenced genomes, taxonomic information for all species whose sequences are present in the database and organismal descriptions of key protistan eukaryotes. All of these data have been integrated and organized in a formal database structure to allow sophisticated biological queries using terms that are inherent in biological concepts. Most importantly, data have been validated, completed, corrected and standardized, a prerequisiteof meaningful analysis. In addition, where critical data are lacking, such as genetic maps and RNA secondary structures, they are generated by the GOBASE team and collaborators, and added to the database. The database is implemented in a relational database management system, but features an object-oriented view of the biological data through a Web/Genera-generated World Wide Web interface. Finally, we have developed software for database curation (i.e. data updates, validation and correction), which will be described in some detail in this paper.
Familial structural rearrangements of chromosomes represent a factor of malformation risk that could vary over a large range, making genetic counseling difficult. However, they also represent a powerful tool for increasing knowledge of the genome, particularly by studying breakpoints and viable imbalances of the genome. We have developed a collaborative database that now includes data on more than 4100 families, from which we have developed a web site called HC Forum® (http://HCForum.imag.fr). It offers geneticists assistance in diagnosis and in genetic counseling by assessing the malformation risk with statistical models. For researchers, interactive interfaces exhibit the distribution of chromosomal breakpoints and of the genome regions observed at birth in trisomy or in monosomy. Dedicated tools including an interactive pedigree allow electronic submission of data, which will be anonymously shown in a forum for discussions. After validation, data are definitively registered in the database with the email of the sender, allowing direct location of biological material. Thus HC Forum® constitutes a link between diagnosis laboratories and genome research centers, and after 1 year, more than 700 users from about 40 different countries already exist.
Signal recognition particle (SRP) is a stable cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complex that serves to translocate secretory proteins across membranes during translation. The SRP Database (SRPDB) provides compilations of SRP components, ordered alphabetically and phylogenetically. Alignments emphasize phylogenetically-supported base pairs in SRP RNA and conserved residues in the proteins. Data are provided in various formats including a column arrangement for improved access and simplified computational usability. Included are motifs for identification of new sequences, SRP RNA secondary structure diagrams, 3-D models and links to high-resolution structures. This release includes 11 new SRP RNA sequences (total of 129), two protein SRP9 sequences (total of seven), two protein SRP14 sequences (total of 10), two protein SRP19 sequences (total of 16), 10 new SRP54 (ffh) sequences (total of 66), two protein SRP68 sequences (total of seven) and two protein SRP72 sequences (total of nine). Seven sequences of the SRP receptor α-subunit and its FtsY homolog (total of 51) are new. Also considered are β-subunit of SRP receptor, Flhf, Hbsu, CaM kinase II and cpSRP43. Access to SRPDB is at http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html and the European mirror http://www.medkem.gu.se/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html
The Conserved Key Amino Acid Positions DataBase (CKAAPs DB) provides access to an analysis of structurally similar proteins with dissimilar sequences where key residues within a common fold are identified. The derivation and significance of CKAAPs starting from pairwise structure alignments is described fully in Reddy et al. [Reddy,B.V.B., Li,W.W., Shindyalov,I.N. and Bourne,P.E. (2000) Proteins, in press]. The CKAAPs identified from this theoretical analysis are provided to experimentalists and theoreticians for potential use in protein engineering and modeling. It has been suggested that CKAAPs may be crucial features for protein folding, structural stability and function. Over 170 substructures, as defined by the Combinatorial Extension (CE) database, which are found in approximately 3000 representative polypeptide chains have been analyzed and are available in the CKAAPs DB. CKAAPs DB also provides CKAAPs of the representative set of proteins derived from the CE and FSSP databases. Thus the database contains over 5000 representative poly­peptide chains, covering all known structures in the PDB. A web interface to a relational database permits fast retrieval of structure-sequence alignments, CKAAPs and associated statistics. Users may query by PDB ID, protein name, function and Enzyme Classification number. Users may also submit protein alignments of their own to obtain CKAAPs. An interface to display CKAAPs on each structure from a web browser is also being implemented. CKAAPs DB is maintained by the San Diego Supercomputer Center and accessible at the URL http://ckaaps.sdsc.edu.
The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP-II), previously described by Maidak et al. [Nucleic Acids Res. (2000), 28, 173–174], continued during the past year to add new rRNA sequences to the aligned data and to improve the analysis commands. Release 8.0 (June 1, 2000) consisted of 16 277 aligned prokaryotic small subunit (SSU) rRNA sequences while the number of eukaryotic and mitochondrial SSU rRNA sequences in aligned form remained at 2055 and 1503, respectively. The number of prokaryotic SSU rRNA sequences more than doubled from the previous release 14 months earlier, and ~75% are longer than 899 bp. An RDP-II mirror site in Japan is now available (http://wdcm.nig.ac.jp/RDP/html/index.html). RDP-II provides aligned and annotated rRNA sequences, derived phylogenetic trees and taxonomic hierarchies, and analysis services through its WWW server (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). Analysis services include rRNA probe checking, approximate phylogenetic placement of user sequences, screening user sequences for possible chimeric rRNA sequences, automated alignment, production of similarity matrices and services to plan and analyze terminal restriction fragment polymorphism experiments. The RDP-II email address for questions and comments has been changed from curator@cme.msu.edu to rdpstaff@msu.edu.
SBASE 8.0 is the eighth release of the SBASE library of protein domain sequences that contains 294 898 annotated structural, functional, ligand-binding and topogenic segments of proteins, cross-referenced to most major sequence databases and sequence pattern collections. The entries are clustered into over 2005 statistically validated domain groups (SBASE-A) and 595 non-validated groups (SBASE-B), provided with several WWW-based search and browsing facilities for online use. A domain-search facility was developed, based on non-parametric pattern recognition methods, including artificial neural networks. SBASE 8.0 is freely available by anonymous ‘ftp’ file transfer from ftp.icgeb.trieste.it. Automated searching of SBASE can be carried out with the WWW servers http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/sbase/ and http://sbase.abc.hu/sbase/.
Since July 1995, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) has maintained RHdb (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/RHdb), a public database for radiation hybrid data. Radiation hybrid mapping is an important technique for determining high resolution maps. RHdb is also served by CORBA servers. The EBI is an Outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).
The objective of database AsMamDB is to facilitate the systematic study of alternatively spliced genes of mammals. Version 1.0 of AsMamDB contains 1563 alternatively spliced genes of human, mouse and rat, each associated with a cluster of nucleotide sequences. The main information provided by AsMamDB includes gene alternative splicing patterns, gene structures, locations in chromosomes, products of genes and tissues where they express. Alternative splicing patterns are represented by multiple alignments of various gene transcripts and by graphs of their topological structures. Gene structures are illustrated by exon, intron and various regulatory elements distributions. There are 4204 DNAs, 3977 mRNAs, 8989 CDSs and 126 931 ESTs in the current database. More than 130 000 GenBank entries are covered and 4443 MEDLINE records are linked. DNA, mRNA, exon, intron and relevant regulatory element sequences are provided in FASTA format. More information can be obtained by using the web-based multiple alignment tool Asalign and various category lists. AsMamDB can be accessed at http://166.111.30.65/ASMAMDB.html .
PDBsum is a web-based database providing a largely pictorial summary of the key information on each macromolecular structure deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It includes images of the structure, annotated plots of each protein chain’s secondary structure, detailed structural analyses generated by the PROMOTIF program, summary PROCHECK results and schematic diagrams of protein–ligand and protein–DNA interactions. RasMol scripts highlight key aspects of the structure, such as the protein’s domains, PROSITE patterns and protein–ligand interactions, for interactive viewing in 3D. Numerous links take the user to related sites. PDBsum is updated whenever any new structures are released by the PDB and is freely accessible via http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/pdbsum.
The non-coding RNAs database (http://biobases.ibch.poznan.pl/ncRNA/) contains currently available data on RNAs, which do not have long open reading frames and act as riboregulators. Non-coding RNAs are involved in the specific recognition of cellular nucleic acid targets through complementary base pairing to control cell growth and differentiation. Some of them are connected with several well known developmental and neuro­behavioral disorders. We have divided them into four groups. This paper is a short introduction to the database and presents its latest, updated edition.
PALI (release 1.2) contains three-dimensional (3-D) structure-dependent sequence alignments as well as structure-based phylogenetic trees of homologous protein domains in various families. The data set of homologous protein structures has been derived by consulting the SCOP database (release 1.50) and the data set comprises 604 families of homologous proteins involving 2739 protein domain structures with each family made up of at least two members. Each member in a family has been structurally aligned with every other member in the same family (pairwise alignment) and all the members in the family are also aligned using simultaneous super­position (multiple alignment). The structural alignments are performed largely automatically, with manual interventions especially in the cases of distantly related proteins, using the program STAMP (version 4.2). Every family is also associated with two dendrograms, calculated using PHYLIP (version 3.5), one based on a structural dissimilarity metric defined for every pairwise alignment and the other based on similarity of topologically equivalent residues. These dendrograms enable easy comparison of sequence and structure-based relationships among the members in a family. Structure-based alignments with the details of structural and sequence similarities, superposed coordinate sets and dendrograms can be accessed conveniently using a web interface. The database can be queried for protein pairs with sequence or structural similarities falling within a specified range. Thus PALI forms a useful resource to help in analysing the relationship between sequence and structure variation at a given level of sequence similarity. PALI also contains over 653 ‘orphans’ (single member families). Using the web interface involving PSI_BLAST and PHYLIP it is possible to associate the sequence of a new protein with one of the families in PALI and generate a phylogenetic tree combining the query sequence and proteins of known 3-D structure. The database with the web interfaced search and dendrogram generation tools can be accessed at http://pauling.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/~pali .
STACK is a tool for detection and visualisation of expressed transcript variation in the context of developmental and pathological states. The datasystem organises and reconstructs human transcripts from available public data in the context of expression state. The expression state of a transcript can include developmental state, pathological association, site of expression and isoform of expressed transcript. STACK consensus transcripts are reconstructed from clusters that capture and reflect the growing evidence of transcript diversity. The comprehensive capture of transcript variants is achieved by the use of a novel clustering approach that is tolerant of sub-sequence diversity and does not rely on pairwise alignment. This is in contrast with other gene indexing projects. STACK is generated at least four times a year and represents the exhaustive processing of all publicly available human EST data extracted from GenBank. This processed information can be explored through 15 tissue-specific categories, a disease-related category and a whole-body index and is accessible via WWW at http://www.sanbi.ac.za/Dbases.html. STACK represents a broadly applicable resource, as it is the only reconstructed transcript database for which the tools for its generation are also broadly available (http://www.sanbi.ac.za/CODES).
The database of imprinted genes and parent-of-origin effects in animals (http://www.otago.ac.nz/IGC ) is a collation of genes and phenotypes for which parent-of-origin effects have been reported. The database currently includes over 220 entries, which describe over 40 imprinted genes in human, mouse and other animals. In addition a wide variety of other parent-of-origin effects, such as transmission of human disease phenotypes, transmission of QTLs, uniparental disomies and interspecies crosses are recorded. Data are accessed through a search engine and references are hyperlinked to PubMed.
The Gene Expression Database (GXD) is a community resource of gene expression information for the laboratory mouse. By combining the different types of expression data, GXD aims to provide increasingly complete information about the expression profiles of genes in different mouse strains and mutants, thus enabling valuable insights into the molecular networks that underlie normal development and disease. GXD is integrated with the Mouse Genome Database (MGD). Extensive interconnections with sequence databases and with databases from other species, and the development and use of shared controlled vocabularies extend GXD’s utility for the analysis of gene expression information. GXD is accessible through the Mouse Genome Informatics web site at http://www.informatics.jax.org/ or directly at http://www.informatics.jax.org/menus/expression_menu.shtml .
The Molecular Biology Database Collection is an online resource listing key databases of value to the biological community. This Collection is intended to bring fellow scientists’ attention to high-quality databases that are available throughout the world, rather than just be a lengthy listing of all available databases. As such, this up-to-date listing is intended to serve as the initial point from which to find specialized databases that may be of use in biological research. The databases included in this Collection provide new value to the underlying data by virtue of curation, new data connections or other innovative approaches. Short, searchable summaries of each of the databases included in the Collection are available through the Nucleic Acids Research Web site, at http://www.nar.oupjournals.org.
The emotif database is a collection of more than 170 000 highly specific and sensitive protein sequence motifs representing conserved biochemical properties and biological functions. These protein motifs are derived from 7697 sequence alignments in the BLOCKS+ database (released on June 23, 2000) and all 8244 protein sequence alignments in the PRINTS database (version 27.0) using the emotif-maker algorithm developed by Nevill-Manning et al. (Nevill-Manning,C.G., Wu,T.D. and Brutlag,D.L. (1998) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 95, 5865–5871; Nevill-Manning,C.G., Sethi,K.S., Wu,T.D. and Brutlag,D.L. (1997) ISMB-97, 5, 202–209). Since the amino acids and the groups of amino acids in these sequence motifs represent critical positions conserved in evolution, search algorithms employing the emotif patterns can identify and classify more widely divergent sequences than methods based on global sequence similarity. The emotif protein pattern database is available at http://motif.stanford.edu/emotif/.
A database (SpliceDB) of known mammalian splice site sequences has been developed. We extracted 43 337 splice pairs from mammalian divisions of the gene-centered Infogene database, including sites from incomplete or alternatively spliced genes. Known EST sequences supported 22 815 of them. After discarding sequences with putative errors and ambiguous location of splice junctions the verified dataset includes 22 489 entries. Of these, 98.71% contain canonical GT–AG junctions (22 199 entries) and 0.56% have non-canonical GC–AG splice site pairs. The remainder (0.73%) occurs in a lot of small groups (with a maximum size of 0.05%). We especially studied non-canonical splice sites, which comprise 3.73% of GenBank annotated splice pairs. EST alignments allowed us to verify only the exonic part of splice sites. To check the conservative dinucleotides we compared sequences of human non-canonical splice sites with sequences from the high throughput genome sequencing project (HTG). Out of 171 human non-canonical and EST-supported splice pairs, 156 (91.23%) had a clear match in the human HTG. They can be classified after sequence analysis as: 79 GC–AG pairs (of which one was an error that corrected to GC–AG), 61 errors corrected to GT–AG canonical pairs, six AT–AC pairs (of which two were errors corrected to AT–AC), one case was produced from a non-existent intron, seven cases were found in HTG that were deposited to GenBank and finally there were only two other cases left of supported non-canonical splice pairs. The information about verified splice site sequences for canonical and non-canonical sites is presented in SpliceDB with the supporting evidence. We also built weight matrices for the major splice groups, which can be incorporated into gene prediction programs. SpliceDB is available at the computational genomic Web server of the Sanger Centre: http://genomic.sanger.ac.uk/spldb/SpliceDB.html and at http://www.softberry.com/spldb/SpliceDB.html.
TIGRFAMs is a collection of protein families featuring curated multiple sequence alignments, hidden Markov models and associated information designed to support the automated functional identification of proteins by sequence homology. We introduce the term ‘equivalog’ to describe members of a set of homologous proteins that are conserved with respect to function since their last common ancestor. Related proteins are grouped into equivalog families where possible, and otherwise into protein families with other hierarchically defined homology types. TIGRFAMs currently contains over 800 protein families, available for searching or downloading at www.tigr.org/TIGRFAMs. Classification by equivalog family, where achievable, complements classification by orthology, superfamily, domain or motif. It provides the information best suited for automatic assignment of specific functions to proteins from large-scale genome sequencing projects.
The Helix Research Institute (HRI) in Japan is releasing 4356 HUman Novel Transcripts and related information in the newly established HUNT database. The institute is a joint research project principally funded by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the clones were sequenced in the governmental New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) Human cDNA Sequencing Project. The HUNT database contains an extensive amount of annotation from advanced analysis and represents an essential bioinformatics contribution towards understanding of the gene function. The HRI human cDNA clones were obtained from full-length enriched cDNA libraries constructed with the oligo-capping method and have resulted in novel full-length cDNA sequences. A large fraction has little similarity to any proteins of known function and to obtain clues about possible function we have developed original analysis procedures. Any putative function deduced here can be validated or refuted by complementary analysis results. The user can also extract information from specific categories like PROSITE patterns, PFAM domains, PSORT localization, transmembrane helices and clones with GENIUS structure assignments. The HUNT database can be accessed at http://www.hri.co.jp/HUNT.
The Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) is the single worldwide archive of structural data of biological macromolecules. This paper describes the data uniformity project that is underway to address the inconsistency in PDB data.
WormBase (http://www.wormbase.org) is a web-based resource for the Caenorhabditis elegans genome and its biology. It builds upon the existing ACeDB database of the C.elegans genome by providing data curation services, a significantly expanded range of subject areas and a user-friendly front end.
The PlantsP database is a curated database that combines information derived from sequences with experimental functional genomics information. PlantsP focuses on plant protein kinases and protein phosphatases. The database will specifically provide a resource for information on a collection of T-DNA insertion mutants (knockouts) in each protein kinase and phosphatase in Arabidopsis thaliana. PlantsP also provides a curated view of each protein that includes a comprehensive annotation of functionally related sequence motifs, sequence family definitions, alignments and phylogenetic trees, and descriptive information drawn directly from the literature. PlantsP is available at http://PlantsP.sdsc.edu.
The HIV Reverse Transcriptase and Protease Sequence Database is an on-line relational database that catalogs evolutionary and drug-related sequence variation in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease enzymes, the molecular targets of anti-HIV therapy (http://hivdb.stanford.edu). The database contains a compilation of nearly all published HIV RT and protease sequences, including submissions from International Collaboration databases and sequences published in journal articles. Sequences are linked to data about the source of the sequence sample and the antiretroviral drug treatment history of the individual from whom the isolate was obtained. During the past year 3500 sequences have been added and the data model has been expanded to include drug susceptibility data on sequenced isolates. Database content has also been integrated with didactic text and the output of two sequence analysis programs.
With the completion of the determination of its entire genome sequence, one of the next major targets of Bacillus subtilis genomics is to clarify the whole gene regulatory network. To this end, the results of systematic experiments should be compared with the rich source of individual experimental results accumulated so far. Thus, we constructed a database of the upstream regulatory information of B.subtilis (DBTBS). The current version was constructed by surveying 291 references and contains information on 90 binding factors and 403 promoters. For each promoter, all of its known cis-elements are listed according to their positions, while these cis-elements are aligned to illustrate their consensus sequence for each transcription factor. All probable transcription factors coded in the genome were classified with the Pfam motifs. Using this database, we compared the character of B.subtilis promoters with that of Escherichia coli promoters. Our database is accessible at http://elmo.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/dbtbs/.
The Mouse Tumor Biology (MTB) Database serves as a curated, integrated resource for information about tumor genetics and pathology in genetically defined strains of mice (i.e., inbred, transgenic and targeted mutation strains). Sources of information for the database include the published scientific literature and direct data submissions by the scientific community. Researchers access MTB using Web-based query forms and can use the database to answer such questions as ‘What tumors have been reported in transgenic mice created on a C57BL/6J background?’, ‘What tumors in mice are associated with mutations in the Trp53 gene?’ and ‘What pathology images are available for tumors of the mammary gland regardless of genetic background?’. MTB has been available on the Web since 1998 from the Mouse Genome Informatics web site (http://www.informatics.jax.org). We have recently implemented a number of enhancements to MTB including new query options, redesigned query forms and results pages for pathology and genetic data, and the addition of an electronic data submission and annotation tool for pathology data.
The ARKdb genome databases provide comprehensive public repositories for genome mapping data from farmed species and other animals (http://www.thearkdb.org) providing a resource similar in function to that offered by GDB or MGD for human or mouse genome mapping data, respectively. Because we have attempted to build a generic mapping database, the system has wide utility, particularly for those species for which development of a specific resource would be prohibitive. The ARKdb genome database model has been implemented for 10 species to date. These are pig, chicken, sheep, cattle, horse, deer, tilapia, cat, turkey and salmon. Access to the ARKdb databases is effected via the World Wide Web using the ARKdb browser and Anubis map viewer. The information stored includes details of loci, maps, experimental methods and the source references. Links to other information sources such as PubMed and EMBL/GenBank are provided. Responsibility for data entry and curation is shared amongst scientists active in genome research in the species of interest. Mirror sites in the United States are maintained in addition to the central genome server at Roslin.
The Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP; http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu) is a database that documents experimentally determined protein–protein interactions. Since January 2000 the number of protein–protein interactions in DIP has nearly tripled to 3472 and the number of proteins to 2659. New interactive tools have been developed to aid in the visualization, navigation and study of networks of protein interactions.
The TRANSFAC database on transcription factors and their DNA-binding sites and profiles (http://www.gene-regulation.de/) has been quantitatively extended and supplemented by a number of modules. These modules give information about pathologically relevant mutations in regulatory regions and transcription factor genes (PathoDB), scaffold/matrix attached regions (S/MARt DB), signal transduction (TRANSPATH) and gene expression sources (CYTOMER). Altogether, these distinct database modules constitute the TRANSFAC system. They are accompanied by a number of program routines for identifying potential transcription factor binding sites or for localizing individual components in the regulatory network of a cell.
The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/) is maintained at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) in an international collaboration with the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and GenBank at the NCBI (USA). Data is exchanged amongst the collaborating databases on a daily basis. The major contributors to the EMBL database are individual authors and genome project groups. Webin is the preferred web-based submission system for individual submitters, whilst automatic procedures allow incorporation of sequence data from large-scale genome sequencing centres and from the European Patent Office (EPO). Database releases are produced quarterly. Network services allow free access to the most up-to-date data collection via ftp, email and World Wide Web interfaces. EBI’s Sequence Retrieval System (SRS), a network browser for databanks in molecular biology, integrates and links the main nucleotide and protein databases plus many specialized databases. For sequence similarity searching a variety of tools (e.g. Blitz, Fasta, BLAST) are available which allow external users to compare their own sequences against the latest data in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database and SWISS-PROT.
The Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND; http://binddb.org) is a database designed to store full descriptions of interactions, molecular complexes and pathways. Development of the BIND 2.0 data model has led to the incorporation of virtually all components of molecular mechanisms including interactions between any two molecules composed of proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. Chemical reactions, photochemical activation and conformational changes can also be described. Everything from small molecule biochemistry to signal transduction is abstracted in such a way that graph theory methods may be applied for data mining. The database can be used to study networks of interactions, to map pathways across taxonomic branches and to generate information for kinetic simulations. BIND anticipates the coming large influx of interaction information from high-throughput proteomics efforts including detailed information about post-translational modifications from mass spectrometry. Version 2.0 of the BIND data model is discussed as well as implementation, content and the open nature of the BIND project. The BIND data specification is available as ASN.1 and XML DTD.
The amount of genomic and proteomic data that is entered each day into databases and the experimental literature is outstripping the ability of experimental scientists to keep pace. While generic databases derived from automated curation efforts are useful, most biological scientists tend to focus on a class or family of molecules and their biological impact. Consequently, there is a need for molecular class-specific or other specialized databases. Such databases collect and organize data around a single topic or class of molecules. If curated well, such systems are extremely useful as they allow experimental scientists to obtain a large portion of the available data most relevant to their needs from a single source. We are involved in the development of two such databases with substantial pharmacological relevance. These are the GPCRDB and NucleaRDB information systems, which collect and disseminate data related to G protein-coupled receptors and intra-nuclear hormone receptors, respectively. The GPCRDB was a pilot project aimed at building a generic molecular class-specific database capable of dealing with highly heterogeneous data. A first version of the GPCRDB project has been completed and it is routinely used by thousands of scientists. The NucleaRDB was started recently as an application of the concept for the generalization of this technology. The GPCRDB is available via the WWW at http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/ and the NucleaRDB at http://www.receptors.org/NR/.
In order to support the structural genomic initiatives, both by rapidly classifying newly determined structures and by suggesting suitable targets for structure determination, we have recently developed several new protocols for classifying structures in the CATH domain database (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath). These aim to increase the speed of classification of new structures using fast algorithms for structure comparison (GRATH) and to improve the sensitivity in recognising distant structural relatives by incorporating sequence information from relatives in the genomes (DomainFinder). In order to ensure the integrity of the database given the expected increase in data, the CATH Protein Family Database (CATH-PFDB), which currently includes 25 320 structural domains and a further 160 000 sequence relatives has now been installed in a relational ORACLE database. This was essential for developing more rigorous validation procedures and for allowing efficient querying of the database, particularly for genome analysis. The associated Dictionary of Homologous Superfamilies [Bray,J.E., Todd,A.E., Pearl,F.M.G., Thornton,J.M. and Orengo,C.A. (2000) Protein Eng., 13, 153–165], which provides multiple structural alignments and functional information to assist in assigning new relatives, has also been expanded recently and now includes information for 903 homo­logous superfamilies. In order to improve coverage of known structures, preliminary classification levels are now provided for new structures at interim stages in the classification protocol. Since a large proportion of new structures can be rapidly classified using profile-based sequence analysis [e.g. PSI-BLAST: Altschul,S.F., Madden,T.L., Schaffer,A.A., Zhang,J., Zhang,Z., Miller,W. and Lipman,D.J. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res., 25, 3389–3402], this provides preliminary classification for easily recognisable homologues, which in the latest release of CATH (version 1.7) represented nearly three-quarters of the non-identical structures.
Signature databases are vital tools for identifying distant relationships in novel sequences and hence for inferring protein function. InterPro is an integrated documentation resource for protein families, domains and functional sites, which amalgamates the efforts of the PROSITE, PRINTS, Pfam and ProDom database projects. Each InterPro entry includes a functional description, annotation, literature references and links back to the relevant member database(s). Release 2.0 of InterPro (October 2000) contains over 3000 entries, representing families, domains, repeats and sites of post-translational modification encoded by a total of 6804 different regular expressions, profiles, fingerprints and Hidden Markov Models. Each InterPro entry lists all the matches against SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL (more than 1 000 000 hits from 462 500 proteins in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL). The database is accessible for text- and sequence-based searches at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/. Questions can be emailed to interhelp@ebi.ac.uk.
The KMDB/MutationView is a graphical database of mutations in human disease-causing genes and its current version consists of nine category-based sub-databases including diseases of eye, heart, ear, brain, cancer, syndrome, autoimmunity, muscle and blood. The KMDB/MutationView stores mutation data of 97 genes involved in 87 different disease and is accessible through http://mutview.dmb.med.keio.ac.jp.
PDB-REPRDB is a database of representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The previous version of PDB-REPRDB provided 48 representative sets, whose similarity criteria were predetermined, on the WWW. The current version is designed so that the user may obtain a quick selection of representative chains from PDB. The selection of representative chains can be dynamically configured according to the user’s requirement. The WWW interface provides a large degree of freedom in setting parameters, such as cut-off scores of sequence and structural similarity. One can obtain a representative list and classification data of protein chains from the system. The current database includes 20 457 protein chains from PDB entries (August 6, 2000). The system for PDB-REPRDB is available at the Parallel Protein Information Analysis system (PAPIA) WWW server (http://www.rwcp.or.jp/papia/).
The PLMItRNA database for mitochondrial tRNA molecules and genes in Viridiplantae (green plants) [Volpetti,V., Gallerani,R., DeBenedetto,C., Liuni,S., Licciulli,F. and Ceci,L.R. (2000) Nucleic Acids Res., 28, 159–162] has been enlarged to include algae. The database now contains 436 genes and 16 tRNA entries relative to 25 higher plants, eight green algae, four red algae (Rhodophytae) and two Stramenopiles. The PLMItRNA database is accessible via the WWW at http://bio-www.ba.cnr.it:8000/PLMItRNA.
The tmRNA database (tmRDB) is maintained at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler, Texas, and accessible on the World Wide Web at the URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/tmRDB/tmRDB.html. Mirror sites are located at Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama (http://www.ag.auburn.edu/mirror/tmRDB/) and the Institute of Biological Sciences, Aarhus, Denmark (http://www.bioinf.au.dk/tmRDB/). The tmRDB provides information and citation links about tmRNA, a molecule that combines functions of tRNA and mRNA in trans-translation. tmRNA is likely to be present in all bacteria and has been found in algae chloroplasts, the cyanelle of Cyanophora paradoxa and the mitochondrion of the flagellate Reclinomonas americana. This release adds 26 new sequences and corresponding predicted tmRNA-encoded tag peptides for a total of 86 tmRNAs, ordered alphabetically and phylogenetically. Secondary structures and three-dimensional models in PDB format for representative molecules are being made available. tmRNA alignments prove individual base pairs and are generated manually assisted by computational tools. The alignments with their corresponding structural annotation can be obtained in various formats, including a new column format designed to improve and simplify computational usability of the data.
GOLD is a comprehensive resource for accessing information related to completed and ongoing genome projects world-wide. The database currently provides information on 350 genome projects, of which 48 have been completely sequenced and their analysis published. GOLD was created in 1997 and since April 2000 it has been licensed to Integrated Genomics. The database is freely available through the URL: http://igweb.integratedgenomics.com/GOLD/.
The Oral Cancer Gene Database (OrCGDB; http://www.tumor-gene.org/Oral/oral.html) was developed to provide the biomedical community with easy access to the latest information on the genes involved in oral cancer. The information is stored in a relational database and accessed through a WWW interface. The OrCGDB is organized by gene name, which is linked to information describing properties of the gene. This information is stored as a collection of findings (‘facts’) that are entered by the database curator in a semi-structured format from information in primary publications using a WWW interface. These facts include causes of oncogenic activation, chromosomal localization of the gene, mutations associated with the gene, the biochemical identity and activity of the gene product, synonyms for the gene name and a variety of clinical information. Each fact is associated with a MEDLINE citation. The user can search the OrCGDB by gene name or by entering a textword. The OrCGDB is part of a larger WWW-based tumor gene database and represents a new approach to catalog and display the research literature.
The database reported here is derived using the Combinatorial Extension (CE) algorithm which compares pairs of protein polypeptide chains and provides a list of structurally similar proteins along with their structure alignments. Using CE, structure–structure alignments can provide insights into biological function. When a protein of known function is shown to be structurally similar to a protein of unknown function, a relationship might be inferred; a relationship not necessarily detectable from sequence comparison alone. Establishing structure–structure relationships in this way is of great importance as we enter an era of structural genomics where there is a likelihood of an increasing number of structures with unknown functions being determined. Thus the CE database is an example of a useful tool in the annotation of protein structures of unknown function. Comparisons can be performed on the complete PDB or on a structurally representative subset of proteins. The source protein(s) can be from the PDB (updated monthly) or uploaded by the user. CE provides sequence alignments resulting from structural alignments and Cartesian coordinates for the aligned structures, which may be analyzed using the supplied Compare3D Java applet, or downloaded for further local analysis. Searches can be run from the CE web site, http://cl.sdsc.edu/ce.html, or the database and software downloaded from the site for local use.
BodyMap is a human and mouse gene expression database that is based on site-directed 3′-expressed sequence tags generated at Osaka University. To date, it contains more than 300 000 tag sequences from 64 human and 39 mouse tissues. For the recent release, the precise anatomical expression patterns for more than half of the human gene entries were generated by introduced amplified fragment length polymorphism (iAFLP), which is a PCR-based high-throughput expression profiling method. The iAFLP data incorporated into BodyMap describe the relative contents of more than 12 000 transcripts across 30 tissue RNAs. In addition, a newly developed gene ranking system helps users obtain lists of genes that have desired expression patterns according to their significance. BodyMap supports complete transfer of unique data sets and provides analysis that is accessible through the WWW at http://bodymap.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.
The RESID Database is a comprehensive collection of annotations and structures for protein post-translational modifications including N-terminal, C-terminal and peptide chain cross-link modifications. The RESID Database includes systematic and frequently observed alternate names, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers, atomic formulas and weights, enzyme activities, taxonomic range, keywords, literature citations with database cross-references, structural diagrams and molecular models. The NRL-3D Sequence–Structure Database is derived from the three-dimensional structure of proteins deposited with the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank. The NRL-3D Database includes standardized and frequently observed alternate names, sources, keywords, literature citations, experimental conditions and searchable sequences from model coordinates. These databases are freely accessible through the National Cancer Institute–Frederick Advanced Biomedical Computing Center at these web sites: http://www.ncifcrf.gov/RESID, http://www.ncifcrf.gov/NRL-3D ; or at these National Biomedical Research Foundation Protein Information Resource web sites: http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/resid.html, http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/nrl3d.html
Thousands of genes have been painstakingly identified and characterized a few genes at a time. Many thousands more are being predicted by large scale cDNA and genomic sequencing projects, with levels of evidence ranging from supporting mRNA sequence and comparative genomics to computing ab initio models. This, coupled with the burgeoning scientific literature, makes it critical to have a comprehensive directory for genes and reference sequences for key genomes. The NCBI provides two resources, LocusLink and RefSeq, to meet these needs. LocusLink organizes information around genes to generate a central hub for accessing gene-specific information for fruit fly, human, mouse, rat and zebrafish. RefSeq provides reference sequence standards for genomes, transcripts and proteins; human, mouse and rat mRNA RefSeqs, and their corresponding proteins, are discussed here. Together, RefSeq and LocusLink provide a non-redundant view of genes and other loci to support research on genes and gene families, variation, gene expression and genome annotation. Additional information about LocusLink and RefSeq is available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has compiled and maintained a Short Tandem Repeat DNA Internet Database (http://www.cstl.nist.gov/biotech/strbase/) since 1997 commonly referred to as STRBase. This database is an information resource for the forensic DNA typing community with details on commonly used short tandem repeat (STR) DNA markers. STRBase consolidates and organizes the abundant literature on this subject to facilitate on-going efforts in DNA typing. Observed alleles and annotated sequence for each STR locus are described along with a review of STR analysis technologies. Additionally, commercially available STR multiplex kits are described, published polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sequences are reported, and validation studies conducted by a number of forensic laboratories are listed. To supplement the technical information, addresses for scientists and hyperlinks to organizations working in this area are available, along with the comprehensive reference list of over 1300 publications on STRs used for DNA typing purposes.
Although a vast amount of life sciences data is generated in the form of images, most scientists still store images on extremely diverse and often incompatible storage media, without any type of metadata structure, and thus with no standard facility with which to conduct searches or analyses. Here we present a solution to unlock the value of scientific images. The Global Image Database (GID) is a web-based (http://www.gwer.ch/qv/gid/gid.htm ) structured central repository for scientific annotated images. The GID was designed to manage images from a wide spectrum of imaging domains ranging from microscopy to automated screening. The annotations in the GID define the source experiment of the images by describing who the authors of the experiment are, when the images were created, the biological origin of the experimental sample and how the sample was processed for visualization. A collection of experimental imaging protocols provides details of the sample preparation, and labeling, or visualization procedures. In addition, the entries in the GID reference these imaging protocols with the probe sequences or antibody names used in labeling experiments. The GID annotations are searchable by field or globally. The query results are first shown as image thumbnail previews, enabling quick browsing prior to original-sized annotated image retrieval. The development of the GID continues, aiming at facilitating the management and exchange of image data in the scientific community, and at creating new query tools for mining image data.
FULL-malaria is a database for a full-length-enriched cDNA library from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (http://133.11.149.55/). Because of its medical importance, this organism is the first target for genome sequencing of a eukaryotic pathogen; the sequences of two of its 14 chromosomes have already been determined. However, for the full exploitation of this rapidly accumulating information, correct identification of the genes and study of their expression are essential. Using the oligo-capping method, we have produced a full-length-enriched cDNA library from erythrocytic stage parasites and performed one-pass reading. The database consists of nucleotide sequences of 2490 random clones that include 390 (16%) known malaria genes according to BLASTN analysis of the nr-nt database in GenBank; these represent 98 genes, and the clones for 48 of these genes contain the complete protein-coding sequence (49%). On the other hand, comparisons with the complete chromosome 2 sequence revealed that 35 of 210 predicted genes are expressed, and in addition led to detection of three new gene candidates that were not previously known. In total, 19 of these 38 clones (50%) were full-length. From these obser­vations, it is expected that the database contains ∼1000 genes, including 500 full-length clones. It should be an invaluable resource for the development of vaccines and novel drugs.
The Plasmodium falciparum Genome Database (http://PlasmoDB.org) integrates sequence information, automated analyses and annotation data emerging from the P.falciparum genome sequencing consortium. To date, raw sequence coverage is available for >90% of the genome, and two chromosomes have been finished and annotated. Data in PlasmoDB are organized by chromosome (1–14), and can be accessed using a variety of tools for graphical and text-based browsing or downloaded in various file formats. The GUS (Genomics Unified Schema) implementation of PlasmoDB provides a multi-species genomic relational database, incorporating data from human and mouse, as well as P.falciparum. The relational schema uses a highly structured format to accommodate diverse data sets related to genomic sequence and gene expression. Tools have been designed to facilitate complex biological queries, including many that are specific to Plasmodium parasites and malaria as a disease. Additional projects seek to integrate genomic information with the rich data sets now becoming available for RNA transcription, protein expression, metabolic pathways, genetic and physical mapping, antigenic and population diversity, and phylogenetic relationships with other apicomplexan parasites. The overall goal of PlasmoDB is to facilitate Internet- and CD-ROM-based access to both finished and unfinished sequence information by the global malaria research community.
The RECODE database is a compilation of ‘programmed’ translational recoding events taken from the scientific literature and personal communications. The database deals with programmed ribosomal frameshifting, codon redefinition and translational bypass occurring in a variety of organisms. The entries for each event include the sequences of the corresponding genes, their encoded proteins for both the normal and alternate decoding, the types of the recoding events involved, trans-factors and cis-elements that influence recoding. The database is freely available at http://recode.genetics.utah.edu/.
There is no control over the information provided with sequences when they are deposited in the sequence databases. Consequently mistakes can seed the incorrect annotation of other sequences. Grouping genes into families and applying controlled annotation overcomes the problems of incorrect annotation associated with individual sequences. Two databases (http://www.mendel.ac.uk) were created to apply controlled annotation to plant genes and plant ESTs: Mendel-GFDb is a database of plant protein (gene) families based on gapped-BLAST analysis of all sequences in the SWISS-PROT family of databases. Sequences are aligned (ClustalW) and identical and similar residues shaded. The families are visually curated to ensure that one or more criteria, for example overall relatedness and/or domain similarity relate all sequences within a family. Sequence families are assigned a ‘Gene Family Number’ and a unified description is developed which best describes the family and its members. If authority exists the gene family is assigned a ‘Gene Family Name’. This information is placed in Mendel-GFDb. Mendel-ESTS is primarily a database of plant ESTs, which have been compared to Mendel-GFDb, completely sequenced genomes and domain databases. This approach associated ESTs with individual sequences and the controlled annotation of gene families and protein domains; the information being placed in Mendel-ESTS. The controlled annotation applied to genes and ESTs provides a basis from which a plant transcription database can be developed.
The Homeodomain Resource is an annotated collection of non-redundant protein sequences, three-dimensional structures and genomic information for the homeodomain protein family. Release 3.0 contains 795 full-length homeodomain-containing sequences, 32 experimentally-derived structures and 143 homeo­box loci implicated in human genetic disorders. Entries are fully hyperlinked to facilitate easy retrieval of the original records from source databases. A simple search engine with a graphical user interface is provided to query the component databases and assemble customized data sets. A new feature for this release is the addition of DNA recognition sites for all human homeodomain proteins described in the literature. The Homeodomain Resource is freely available through the World Wide Web at http://genome.nhgri.nih.gov/homeodomain.
The Human Genome Project has generated extensive map and sequence data for a large number of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones. In order to maximize the efficient use of the data and to minimize the redundant work for the research community, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) comprehensive BAC resource (cBACr) (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/BacResource/BAC_resource_intro.html) was built as an expansion of the TIGR human BAC ends database. This resource collects, integrates and reports the information on library, maps, sequence, annotation and functions for each human and mouse BAC. The current database contains 635 016 human BACs and 265 617 mouse BACs that were characterized by various approaches, among which 22 705 human clones and 1000 mouse clones have sequence and annotation data.
REBASE contains comprehensive information about restriction enzymes, DNA methylases and related proteins such as nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control proteins. It contains published and unpublished references, recognition and cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, methy­lation sensitivity, crystal data and sequence data. Homing endonucleases are also included. Most recently, extensive information about the methy­lation sensitivity of restriction enzymes has been added and a new feature contains complete analyses of the putative restriction systems in the sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes. The data is distributed via email, ftp (ftp.neb.com) and the Web (http://rebase.neb.com).
In addition to maintaining the GenBank® nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides data analysis and retrieval resources that operate on the data in GenBank and a variety of other biological data made available through NCBI’s Web site.

Data analysis resources include BLAST, Electronic PCR, OrfFinder, RefSeq, UniGene, HomoloGene, Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP), Human Genome Sequencing, Human MapViewer, GeneMap’99, Human–Mouse Homology Map, Cancer Chromosome Aberration Project (CCAP), Entrez Genomes, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database, Retroviral Genotyping Tools, Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP), SAGEmap, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Online Mendelian Inheri­tance in Man (OMIM), the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB) and the Conserved Domain Database (CDD). Augmenting many of the Web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets. All of the resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
PseudoBase is a database containing structural, functional and sequence data related to RNA pseudo­knots. It can be reached at http://wwwbio.LeidenUniv.nl/∼Batenburg/PKB.html. For each pseudoknot, thirteen items are stored, for example the relevant sequence, the stem positions of the pseudoknot, the EMBL accession number of the sequence and the support that can be given regarding the reliability of the pseudo­knot. Since the last publication, information on sizes of the stems and the loops in the pseudoknots has been added. Also added are alternative entries that produce surveys of where the pseudoknots are, sorted according to stem size or loop size.
ALFRED (the ALelle FREquency Database) is designed to store and disseminate frequencies of alleles at human polymorphic sites for multiple populations, primarily for the population genetics and molecular anthropology communities. Currently ALFRED has information on over 180 polymorphic sites for more than 70 populations. Since our initial release of the database we have focussed on increasing the quantity and quality of data, making reciprocal links between ALFRED and other related databases, and providing useful tools to make the data more comprehensible to the end user. ALFRED is accessible from the Kidd Lab home page (http://info.med.yale.edu/genetics/kkidd/) or from ALFRED directly (http://alfred.med.yale.edu/alfred/index.asp).
The University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (UM-BBD, http://umbbd.ahc.umn.edu/) provides curated information on microbial catabolic enzymes and their organization into metabolic pathways. Currently, it contains information on over 400 enzymes. In the last year the enzyme page was enhanced to contain more internal and external links; it also displays the different metabolic pathways in which each enzyme participates. In collaboration with the Nomenclature Commission of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 35 UM-BBD enzymes were assigned complete EC codes during 2000. Bacterial oxygenases are heavily represented in the UM-BBD; they are known to have broad substrate specificity. A compilation of known reactions of naphthalene and toluene dioxygenases were recently added to the UM-BBD; 73 and 108 were listed respectively. In 2000 the UM-BBD is mirrored by two prestigious groups: the European Bioinformatics Institute and KEGG (the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). Collaborations with other groups are being developed. The increased emphasis on UM-BBD enzymes is important for predicting novel metabolic pathways that might exist in nature or could be engineered. It also is important for current efforts in microbial genome annotation.
The Kabat Database was initially started in 1970 to determine the combining site of antibodies based on the available amino acid sequences. The precise delineation of complementarity determining regions (CDR) of both light and heavy chains provides the first example of how properly aligned sequences can be used to derive structural and functional information of biological macromolecules. This knowledge has subsequently been applied to the construction of artificial antibodies with prescribed specificities, and to many other studies. The Kabat database now includes nucleotide sequences, sequences of T cell receptors for antigens (TCR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, and other proteins of immunological interest. While new sequences are continually added into this database, we have undertaken the task of developing more analytical methods to study the information content of this collection of aligned sequences. New examples of analysis will be illustrated on a yearly basis. The Kabat Database and its applications are freely available at http://immuno.bme.nwu.edu.
TRIPLES is a web-accessible database of TRansposon-Insertion Phenotypes, Localization and Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—a relational database housing nearly half a million data points generated from an ongoing study using large-scale transposon mutagenesis to characterize gene function in yeast. At present, TRIPLES contains three principal data sets (i.e. phenotypic data, protein localization data and expression data) for over 3500 annotated yeast genes as well as several hundred non-annotated open reading frames. In addition, the TRIPLES web site provides online order forms linked to each data set so that users may request any strain or reagent generated from this project free of charge. In response to user requests, the TRIPLES web site has undergone several recent modifications. Our localization data have been supplemented with approximately 500 fluorescent micrographs depicting actual staining patterns observed upon indirect immunofluorescence analysis of indicated epitope-tagged proteins. These localization data, as well as all other data sets within TRIPLES, are now available in full as tab-delimited text. To accommodate increased reagent requests, all orders are now cataloged in a separate database, and users are notified immediately of order receipt and shipment. Also, TRIPLES is one of five sites incorporated into the new functional analysis tool Function Junction provided by the Saccharomyces Genome Database. TRIPLES may be accessed from the Yale Genome Analysis Center (YGAC) homepage at http://ygac.med.yale.edu.
The Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP: http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu) is a database that documents experimentally determined protein–protein interactions. It provides the scientific community with an integrated set of tools for browsing and extracting information about protein interaction networks. As of September 2001, the DIP catalogs ∼11 000 unique interactions among 5900 proteins from >80 organisms; the vast majority from yeast, Helicobacter pylori and human. Tools have been developed that allow users to analyze, visualize and integrate their own experimental data with the information about protein–protein interactions available in the DIP database.
READ, the RIKEN Expression Array Database, is a database of expression profile data from the RIKEN mouse cDNA microarray. It stores the microarray experimental data and information, and provides Web interfaces for researchers to use to retrieve, analyze and display their data. The goals for READ are to serve as a storage site for microarray data from ongoing research in the RIKEN mouse encyclopedia project and to provide useful links and tools to decipher biologically important information. The gene information is based mainly on the fully annotated FANTOM database. READ can be accessed at http://read.gsc.riken.go.jp/. READ also provides a search tool [READ integrates gene expression neighbor (RINGENE)] for genes with similarities in expression profiling.
The Olfactory Receptor Database (ORDB; http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/ordb) is a central repository of olfactory receptor (OR) and olfactory receptor-like gene and protein sequences. To deal with the very large OR gene family, we have constructed an algorithm that automatically downloads sequences from web sources such as GenBank and SWISS-PROT into the database. The algorithm uses hypertext markup language (HTML) parsing techniques that extract information relevant to ORDB. The information is then correlated with the metadata in the ORDB knowledge base to encode the unstructured text extracted into the structured format compliant with the database architecture, entity attribute value with classes and relationship (EAV/CR), which supports the SenseLab project as a whole. Three population methods: batch, automatic and semi-automatic population are discussed. The data is imported into the database using extensible markup language (XML).
The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) project was initiated in response to the growing demand for a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data. GEO provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission, storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.
tmRNA (also known as 10Sa RNA or SsrA) plays a central role in an unusual mode of translation, whereby a stalled ribosome switches from a problematic mRNA to a short reading frame within tmRNA during translation of a single polypeptide chain. Research on the mechanism, structure and biology of tmRNA is served by the tmRNA Website, a collection of sequences for tmRNA and the encoded proteolysis-inducing peptide tags, alignments, careful documentation and other information; the URL is http://www.indiana.edu/~tmrna. Four pseudoknots are usually present in each tmRNA, so the database is rich with information on pseudoknot variability. Since last year it has doubled (227 tmRNA sequences as of September 2001), a sequence alignment for the tmRNA cofactor SmpB has been included, and genomic data for Clostridium botulinum has revealed a group I (subgroup IA3) intron interrupting the tmRNA T-loop.
The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) resources, ranging from genetic and physical maps to genome-wide analysis tools, reflect the scientific progress in identifying genes and their functions over the last decade. As emphasis shifts from identification of the genes to identification of the role of their gene products in the cell, SGD seeks to provide its users with annotations that will allow relationships to be made between gene products, both within Saccharomyces cerevisiae and across species. To this end, SGD is annotating genes to the Gene Ontology (GO), a structured representation of biological knowledge that can be shared across species. The GO consists of three separate ontologies describing molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The goal is to use published information to associate each characterized S.cerevisiae gene product with one or more GO terms from each of the three ontologies. To be useful, this must be done in a manner that allows accurate associations based on experimental evidence, modifications to GO when necessary, and careful documentation of the annotations through evidence codes for given citations. Reaching this goal is an ongoing process at SGD. For information on the current progress of GO annotations at SGD and other participating databases, as well as a description of each of the three ontologies, please visit the GO Consortium page at http://www.geneontology.org. SGD gene associations to GO can be found by visiting our site at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/.
The 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (5′- and 3′-UTRs) of eukaryotic mRNAs are known to play a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression modulating nucleo-cytoplasmic mRNA transport, translation efficiency, subcellular localization and stability. UTRdb is a specialized database of 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs cleaned from redundancy. UTRdb entries are enriched with specialized information not present in the primary databases including the presence of nucleotide sequence patterns already demonstrated by experimental analysis to have some functional role. All these patterns have been collected in the UTRsite database so that it is possible to search any input sequence for the presence of annotated functional motifs. Furthermore, UTRdb entries have been annotated for the presence of repetitive elements. All Internet resources we implemented for retrieval and functional analysis of 5′- and 3′-UTRs of eukaryotic mRNAs are accessible at http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/BIG/UTRHome/.
Members of a superfamily of proteins could result from divergent evolution of homologues with insignificant similarity in the amino acid sequences. A superfamily relationship is detected commonly after the three-dimensional structures of the proteins are determined using X-ray analysis or NMR. The SUPFAM database described here relates two homologous protein families in a multiple sequence alignment database of either known or unknown structure. The present release (1.1), which is the first version of the SUPFAM database, has been derived by analysing Pfam, which is one of the commonly used databases of multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins. The first step in establishing SUPFAM is to relate Pfam families with the families in PALI, which is an alignment database of homologous proteins of known structure that is derived largely from SCOP. The second step involves relating Pfam families which could not be associated reliably with a protein superfamily of known structure. The profile matching procedure, IMPALA, has been used in these steps. The first step resulted in identification of 1280 Pfam families (out of 2697, i.e. 47%) which are related, either by close homologous connection to a SCOP family or by distant relationship to a SCOP family, potentially forming new superfamily connections. Using the profiles of 1417 Pfam families with apparently no structural information, an all-against-all comparison involving a sequence-profile match using IMPALA resulted in clustering of 67 homologous protein families of Pfam into 28 potential new superfamilies. Expansion of groups of related proteins of yet unknown structural information, as proposed in SUPFAM, should help in identifying ‘priority proteins’ for structure determination in structural genomics initiatives to expand the coverage of structural information in the protein sequence space. For example, we could assign 858 distinct Pfam domains in 2203 of the gene products in the genome of Mycobacterium tubercolosis. Fifty-one of these Pfam families of unknown structure could be clustered into 17 potentially new superfamilies forming good targets for structural genomics. SUPFAM database can be accessed at http://pauling.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/~supfam.
The Pharmacogenetics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB; http://www.pharmgkb.org/) contains genomic, phenotype and clinical information collected from ongoing pharmacogenetic studies. Tools to browse, query, download, submit, edit and process the information are available to registered research network members. A subset of the tools is publicly available. PharmGKB currently contains over 150 genes under study, 14 Coriell populations and a large ontology of pharmacogenetics concepts. The pharmacogenetic concepts and the experimental data are interconnected by a set of relations to form a knowledge base of information for pharmacogenetic researchers. The information in PharmGKB, and its associated tools for processing that information, are tailored for leading-edge pharmacogenetics research. The PharmGKB project was initiated in April 2000 and the first version of the knowledge base went online in February 2001.
In addition to maintaining the GenBank nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides data analysis and retrieval resources that operate on the data in GenBank and a variety of other biological data made available through NCBI’s web site. NCBI data retrieval resources include Entrez, PubMed, LocusLink and the Taxonomy Browser. Data analysis resources include BLAST, Electronic PCR, OrfFinder, RefSeq, UniGene, HomoloGene, Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP), Human Genome Sequencing, Human MapViewer, Human¡VMouse Homology Map, Cancer Chromosome Aberration Project (CCAP), Entrez Genomes, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database, Retroviral Genotyping Tools, SAGEmap, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB) and the Conserved Domain Database (CDD). Augmenting many of the web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets. All of the resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
The AraC-XylS database contains information about a family of positive transcriptional regulators broadly distributed in bacteria. This specific database focuses on protein sequences and on the biological and functional features of each of the proteins that belong to this family. Each entry provides information on the protein itself, the annotated protein sequence and, when the crystal is available, a comprehensive representation of its three-dimensional structure. The organization of the database is based on an exhaustive analysis of the scientific literature. The data are interconnected and linked with other databases. Multiple alignments of the members of the family, an extensive collection of references and a tutorial about the family provide additional information. The AraC-XylS database is accessible on the World Wide Web at http://www.AraC-XylS.org.
The AMmtDB database (http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/mitochondriome) has been updated by collecting the multi-aligned sequences of Chordata and Invertebrata mitochondrial genes coding for proteins and tRNAs. Links to the multi-aligned mtDNA intraspecies variants, collected in VarMmtDB at the Mitochondriome web site, have been introduced. The genes coding for proteins are multi-aligned based on the translated sequences and both the nucleotide and amino acid multi-alignments are provided. AMmtDB data selected through SRS can be viewed and managed using GeneDoc or other programs for the management of multi-aligned data depending on the user’s operative system. The multiple alignments have been produced with CLUSTALW and PILEUP programs and then carefully optimized manually.
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM™) is a comprehensive, authoritative and timely knowledgebase of human genes and genetic disorders compiled to support research and education in human genomics and the practice of clinical genetics. Started by Dr Victor A. McKusick as the definitive reference Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim) is now distributed electronically by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), where it is integrated with the Entrez suite of databases. Derived from the biomedical literature, OMIM is written and edited at Johns Hopkins University with input from scientists and physicians around the world. Each OMIM entry has a full-text summary of a genetically determined phenotype and/or gene and has numerous links to other genetic databases such as DNA and protein sequence, PubMed references, general and locus-specific mutation databases, approved gene nomenclature, and the highly detailed mapviewer, as well as patient support groups and many others. OMIM is an easy and straightforward portal to the burgeoning information in human genetics.
Arabidopsisthaliana is the first plant for which the complete genome has been sequenced and published. Annotation of complex eukaryotic genomes requires more than the assignment of genetic elements to the sequence. Besides completing the list of genes, we need to discover their cellular roles, their regulation and their interactions in order to understand the workings of the whole plant. The MIPS Arabidopsisthaliana Database (MAtDB; http://mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db) started out as a repository for genome sequence data in the European Scientists Sequencing Arabidopsis (ESSA) project and the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative. Our aim is to transform MAtDB into an integrated biological knowledge resource by integrating diverse data, tools, query and visualization capabilities and by creating a comprehensive resource for Arabidopsis as a reference model for other species, including crop plants.
CSDBase (http://www.chemie.uni-marburg.de/~csdbase/) is an interactive Internet-embedded research platform providing detailed information on proteins containing the cold shock domain (CSD). It consists of two separated database cores, one dedicated to CSD protein information, and one to provide a powerful resource to relevant literature with emphasis on the bacterial cold shock response. In addition to detailed protein information and useful cross links to other web sites, CSDBase contains computer-generated CSD structure models for most CSD-containing protein sequences available at NCBI non-redundant protein database at the time of CSDBase establishment. These models were calculated on the basis of known crystal and/or NMR structures using SWISS-MODEL and can be downloaded as PDB structure coordinate files for viewing and for manipulation with other software tools. CSDBase will be regularly updated and is organized in a compact form providing user friendly interfaces to both database cores which allow for easy data retrieval.
Thousands of new vertebrate genes have been discovered and genetic systems are needed to address their functions at the cellular level. The chicken B cell line DT40 allows efficient gene disruptions due to its high homologous recombination activity. However, cloning the gene of interest is often cumbersome, since relatively few chicken cDNA sequences are present in the public databases. In addition, the accumulation of multiple mutations within the same cell clone is limited by the consumption of one drug-resistance marker for each transfection. Here, we present the DT40 web site (http://genetics.hpi.uni-hamburg.de/dt40.html), which includes a comprehensive database of chicken bursal ESTs to identify disruption candidate genes and recyclable marker cassettes based on the loxP system. These freely available resources greatly facilitate the analysis of genes and genetic networks.
MAGEST is a database for maternal gene expression information for an ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi. The ascidian has become an animal model in developmental biological research because it shows a simple developmental process, and belongs to one of the chordate groups. Various data are deposited into the MAGEST database, e.g. the 3′- and 5′-tag sequences from the fertilized egg cDNA library, the results of similarity searches against GenBank and the expression data from whole mount in situ hybridization. Over the last 2 years, the data retrieval systems have been improved in several aspects, and the tag sequence entries have increased to over 20 000 clones. Additionally, we constructed a database, translated MAGEST, for the amino acid fragment sequences predicted from the EST data sets. Using this information comprehensively, we should obtain new information on gene functions. The MAGEST database is accessible via the Internet at http://www.genome.ad.jp/magest/.
The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) is an annotated, non-redundant collection of eukaryotic Pol II promoters, for which the transcription start site has been determined experimentally. Access to promoter sequences is provided by pointers to positions in nucleotide sequence entries. The annotation part of an entry includes a description of the initiation site mapping data, exhaustive cross-references to the EMBL nucleotide sequence database, SWISS-PROT, TRANSFAC and other databases, as well as bibliographic references. EPD is structured in a way that facilitates dynamic extraction of biologically meaningful promoter subsets for comparative sequence analysis. World Wide Web-based interfaces have been developed which enable the user to view EPD entries in different formats, to select and extract promoter sequences according to a variety of criteria, and to navigate to related databases exploiting different cross-references. The EPD web site also features yearly updated base frequency matrices for major eukaryotic promoter elements. EPD can be accessed at http://www.epd.isb-sib.ch.
JSNP is a repository of Japanese Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data, begun in 2000 and developed through the Prime Minister’s Millennium Project. The aim of this undertaking is to identify and collate up to 150 000 SNPs from the Japanese population, located in genes or in adjacent regions that might influence the coding sequence of the genes. The project has been carried out by a collaboration between the Human Genome Center (HGC) in the Institute of Medical Science (IMS) at the University of Tokyo and the Japan Science and Technology Corporation (JST). JSNP serves as both a storage site for the Japanese SNPs obtained from the ongoing project and as a facility for public dissemination to allow researchers access to high quality SNP data. A primary motivation of the project is the construction of a basic data set to identify relationships between polymorphisms and common diseases or the reaction to drugs. As such, emphasis has been placed on the identification of SNPs that lie in candidate regions which may affect phenotype but which would not necessarily directly cause disease. Unrestricted access to JSNP and any associated files is available at http://snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.
PlasmoDB (http://PlasmoDB.org) is the official database of the Plasmodium falciparum genome sequencing consortium. This resource incorporates finished and draft genome sequence data and annotation emerging from Plasmodium sequencing projects. PlasmoDB currently houses information from five parasite species and provides tools for cross-species comparisons. Sequence information is also integrated with other genomic-scale data emerging from the Plasmodium research community, including gene expression analysis from EST, SAGE and microarray projects. The relational schemas used to build PlasmoDB [Genomics Unified Schema (GUS) and RNA Abundance Database (RAD)] employ a highly structured format to accommodate the diverse data types generated by sequence and expression projects. A variety of tools allow researchers to formulate complex, biologically based queries of the database. A version of the database is also available on CD-ROM (Plasmodium GenePlot), facilitating access to the data in situations where Internet access is difficult (e.g. by malaria researchers working in the field). The goal of PlasmoDB is to enhance utilization of the vast quantities of data emerging from genome-scale projects by the global malaria research community.
FIMM database (http://sdmc.krdl.org.sg:8080/fimm) contains data relevant to functional molecular immunology, focusing on cellular immunology. It contains fully referenced data on protein antigens, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, MHC-associated peptides and relevant disease associations. FIMM has a set of search tools for extraction of information and results are presented as lists or as reports.
The MEROPS database (http://www.merops.ac.uk) has been redesigned to accommodate increased amounts of information still in pages of moderate size that load rapidly. The information on each PepCard, FamCard or ClanCard has been divided between several sub-pages that can be reached by use of navigation buttons in a frame at the top of the screen. Several important additions have also been made to the database. Amongst these are CGI searches that allow the user to find a peptidase by name, its MEROPS identifier or its human or mouse chromosome location. The user may also list all published tertiary structures for a peptidase clan or family, and search for peptidase specificity data by entering either a peptidase name, substrate or bond cleaved. The PepCards, FamCards and ClanCards now have literature pages listing about 10 000 key papers in total, mostly with links to MEDLINE. Many PepCards now include a protein sequence alignment and data table for matching human, mouse or rat expressed sequence tags. FamCards and ClanCards contain Structure pages showing diagrammatic representations of known secondary structures of member peptidases or family type examples, respectively. Many novel peptidases have been added to the database after being discovered in complete genomes, libraries of expressed sequence tags or data from high-throughput genomic sequencing, and we describe the methods by which these were found.
The Metalloprotein Database and Browser (MDB; http://metallo.scripps.edu) at The Scripps Research Institute is a web-accessible resource for metalloprotein research. It offers the scientific community quantitative information on geometrical parameters of metal-binding sites in protein structures available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The MDB also offers analytical tools for the examination of trends or patterns in the indexed metal-binding sites. A user can perform interactive searches, metal-site structure visualization (via a Java applet), and analysis of the quantitative data by accessing the MDB through a web browser without requiring an external application or platform-dependent plugin. The MDB also has a non-interactive interface with which other web sites and network-aware applications can seamlessly incorporate data or statistical analysis results from metal-binding sites. The information contained in the MDB is periodically updated with automated algorithms that find and index metal sites from new protein structures released by the PDB.
The ever increasing rate at which whole genome sequences are becoming accessible to the scientific community has created an urgent need for tools enabling comparison of chromosomes of different species. We have applied biometric methods to available chromosome sequences and posted the results on our Comparative Genometrics (CG) web site. By genometrics, a term coined by Elston and Wilson [Genet. Epidemiol. (1990), 7, 17–19], we understand a biometric analysis of chromosomes. During the initial phase, our web site displays, for all completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes, three genometric analyses: the DNA walk [Lobry (1999) Microbiology Today, 26, 164–165] and two complementary representations, i.e. the cumulative GC- and TA-skew analyses, capable of identifying, at the level of whole genomes, features inherent to chromosome organization and functioning. It appears that the latter features are taxon-specific. Although primarily focused on prokaryotic chromosomes, the CG web site contains genometric information on paradigm plasmids, phages, viruses and eukaryotic organelles. Relevant data and methods can be readily used by the scientific community for further analyses as well as for tutorial purposes. Our data posted at the CG web site are freely available on the World Wide Web at http://www.unil.ch/comparativegenometrics.
PASS2 is a nearly automated version of CAMPASS and contains sequence alignments of proteins grouped at the level of superfamilies. This database has been created to fall in correspondence with SCOP database (1.53 release) and currently consists of 110 multi-member superfamilies and 613 superfamilies corresponding to single members. In multi-member superfamilies, protein chains with no more than 25% sequence identity have been considered for the alignment and hence the database aims to address sequence alignments which represent 26 219 protein domains under the SCOP 1.53 release. Structure-based sequence alignments have been obtained by COMPARER and the initial equivalences are provided automatically from a MALIGN alignment and subsequently augmented using STAMP4.0. The final sequence alignments have been annotated for the structural features using JOY4.0. Several interesting links are provided to other related databases and genome sequence relatives. Availability of reliable sequence alignments of distantly related proteins, despite poor sequence identity and single-member superfamilies, permit better sampling of structures in libraries for fold recognition of new sequences and for the understanding of protein structure–function relationships of individual superfamilies. The database can be queried by keywords and also by sequence search, interfaced by PSI-BLAST methods. Structure-annotated sequence alignments and several structural accessory files can be retrieved for all the superfamilies including the user-input sequence. The database can be accessed from http://www.ncbs.res.in/%7Efaculty/mini/campass/pass.html.
Gramene (http://www.gramene.org) is a comparative genome mapping database for grasses and a community resource for rice. Rice, in addition to being an economically important crop, is also a model monocot for understanding other agronomically important grass genomes. Gramene replaces the existing AceDB database ‘RiceGenes’ with a relational database based on Oracle. Gramene provides curated and integrative information about maps, sequence, genes, genetic markers, mutants, QTLs, controlled vocabularies and publications. Its aims are to use the rice genetic, physical and sequence maps as fundamental organizing units, to provide a common denominator for moving from one crop grass to another and is to serve as a portal for interconnecting with other web-based crop grass resources. This paper describes the initial steps we have taken towards realizing these goals.
The ribosomal differentiation of medical micro-organisms (RIDOM) web server, first described by Harmsen et al. [Harmsden,D., Rothganger,J., Singer,C., Albert,J. and Frosch,M. (1999) Lancet, 353, 291], is an evolving electronic resource designed to provide micro-organism differentiation services for medical identification needs. The diagnostic procedure begins with a specimen partial small subunit ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) sequence. Resulting from a similarity search, a species or genus name for the specimen in question will be returned. Where the first results are ambiguous or do not define to species level, hints for further molecular, i.e. internal transcribed spacer, and conventional phenotypic differentiation will be offered (‘sequential and polyphasic approach’). Additionally, each entry in RIDOM contains detailed medical and taxonomic information linked, context-sensitive, to external World Wide Web services. Nearly all sequences are newly determined and the sequence chromatograms are available for intersubjective quality control. Similarity searches are now also possible by direct submission of trace files (ABI or SCF format). Based on the PHRED/PHRAP software, error probability measures are attached to each predicted nucleotide base and visualised with a new ‘Trace Editor’. The RIDOM web site is directly accessible on the World Wide Web at http://www.ridom.de/. The email address for questions and comments is webmaster@ridom.de.
The Yeast Protein Localization database (YPL.db) contains information about the localization patterns of yeast proteins resulting from microscopic analyses. The data and parameters of the experiments to obtain the localization information, together with images from confocal or video microscopy, are stored in a relational database, building an archive of, and the documentation for, all experiments. The database can be queried based on gene name, protein localization, growth conditions and a number of additional parameters. All experiment parameters are selectable from predefined lists to ensure database integrity and conformity across different investigators. The database provides a structure reference resource to allow for better characterization of unknown or ambiguous localization patterns. Links to MIPS, YPD and SGD databases are provided to allow fast access to further information not contained in the localization database itself. YPL.db is available at http://ypl.tugraz.at.
Nuclear hormone receptors are an abundant class of ligand activated transcriptional regulators, found in varying numbers in all animals. Based on our experience of managing the official nomenclature of nuclear receptors, we have developed NUREBASE, a database containing protein and DNA sequences, reviewed protein alignments and phylogenies, taxonomy and annotations for all nuclear receptors. The reviewed NUREBASE is completed by NUREBASE_DAILY, automatically updated every 24 h. Both databases are organized under a client/server architecture, with a client written in Java which runs on any platform. This client, named FamFetch, integrates a graphical interface allowing selection of families, and manipulation of phylogenies and alignments. NUREBASE sequence data is also accessible through a World Wide Web server, allowing complex queries. All information on accessing and installing NUREBASE may be found at http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LBMC/laudet/nurebase.html.
Since the advent of the draft human genome sequence there has been growing interest in transcriptome analysis based on genomic data. The Gene Resource Locator (GRL) assembles gene maps that include information on gene-expression patterns, cis-elements in regulatory regions and alternatively spliced transcripts. The database was constructed using customized software, and currently contains 2.2 million alignments (exon–intron structures). The alignments have been annotated and integrated into a system that encompasses approximately 90 000 EST loci sharing common exons, 8091 alternatively spliced transcript groups, 10 801 expression-profile groups, 8066 candidate regulatory regions in full-length cDNAs, and 1 million SNP loci. We have used Flash technology to build a dynamic web viewer that facilitates browsing through the millions of alignments. All of the information is available through the World Wide Web at the Gene Resource Locator web site (http://grl.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp).
We have integrated the protein families from SYSTERS and the expressed sequence tag (EST) clusters from our database GeneNest with SpliceNest, a new database mapping EST contigs into genomic DNA. The SYSTERS protein sequence cluster set provides an automatically generated classification of all sequences of the SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL and PIR databases into disjoint protein family and superfamily clusters. GeneNest is a database and software package for producing and visualizing gene indices from ESTs and mRNAs. Currently, the database comprises gene indices of human, mouse, Arabidopsis thaliana and zebrafish. SpliceNest is a web-based graphical tool to explore gene structure, including alternative splicing, based on a mapping of the EST consensus sequences from GeneNest to the complete human genome. The integration of SYSTERS, GeneNest and SpliceNest into one framework now permits an overall exploration of the whole sequence space covering protein, mRNA and EST sequences, as well as genomic DNA. The databases are available for querying and browsing at http://cmb.molgen.mpg.de.
The Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/) database project provides a bioinformatics framework to organise biology around the sequences of large genomes. It is a comprehensive source of stable automatic annotation of the human genome sequence, with confirmed gene predictions that have been integrated with external data sources, and is available as either an interactive web site or as flat files. It is also an open source software engineering project to develop a portable system able to handle very large genomes and associated requirements from sequence analysis to data storage and visualisation. The Ensembl site is one of the leading sources of human genome sequence annotation and provided much of the analysis for publication by the international human genome project of the draft genome. The Ensembl system is being installed around the world in both companies and academic sites on machines ranging from supercomputers to laptops.
Pfam is a large collection of protein multiple sequence alignments and profile hidden Markov models. Pfam is available on the World Wide Web in the UK at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/, in Sweden at http://www.cgb.ki.se/Pfam/, in France at http://pfam.jouy.inra.fr/ and in the US at http://pfam.wustl.edu/. The latest version (6.6) of Pfam contains 3071 families, which match 69% of proteins in SWISS-PROT 39 and TrEMBL 14. Structural data, where available, have been utilised to ensure that Pfam families correspond with structural domains, and to improve domain-based annotation. Predictions of non-domain regions are now also included. In addition to secondary structure, Pfam multiple sequence alignments now contain active site residue mark-up. New search tools, including taxonomy search and domain query, greatly add to the functionality and usability of the Pfam resource.
Although many human genes have been associated with genetic diseases, knowing which mutations result in disease phenotypes often does not explain the etiology of a specific disease. Drosophilamelanogaster provides a powerful system in which to use genetic and molecular approaches to investigate human genetic diseases. Homophila is an intergenomic resource linking the human and fly genomes in order to stimulate functional genomic investigations in Drosophila that address questions about genetic disease in humans. Homophila provides a comprehensive linkage between the disease genes compiled in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and the complete Drosophila genomic sequence. Homophila is a relational database that allows searching based on human disease descriptions, OMIM number, human or fly gene names, and sequence similarity, and can be accessed at http://homophila.sdsc.edu.
PlantCARE is a database of plant cis-acting regulatory elements, enhancers and repressors. Regulatory elements are represented by positional matrices, consensus sequencesand individual sites on particular promoter sequences. Links to the EMBL, TRANSFAC and MEDLINE databases are provided when available. Data about the transcription sites are extracted mainly from the literature, supplemented with an increasing number of in silico predicted data. Apart from a general description for specific transcription factor sites, levels of confidence for the experimental evidence, functional information and the position on the promoter are given as well. New features have been implemented to search for plant cis-acting regulatory elements in a query sequence. Furthermore, links are now provided to a new clustering and motif search method to investigate clusters of co-expressed genes. New regulatory elements can be sent automatically and will be added to the database after curation. The PlantCARE relational database is available via the World Wide Web at http://sphinx.rug.ac.be:8080/PlantCARE/.
The ASTRAL compendium provides several databases and tools to aid in the analysis of protein structures, particularly through the use of their sequences. It is partially derived from the SCOP database of protein domains, and it includes sequences for each domain as well as other resources useful for studying these sequences and domain structures. Several major improvements have been made to the ASTRAL compendium since its initial release 2 years ago. The number of protein domain sequences included has doubled from 15 190 to 30 867, and additional databases have been added. The Rapid Access Format (RAF) database contains manually curated mappings linking the biological amino acid sequences described in the SEQRES records of PDB entries to the amino acid sequences structurally observed (provided in the ATOM records) in a format designed for rapid access by automated tools. This information is used to derive sequences for protein domains in the SCOP database. In cases where a SCOP domain spans several protein chains, all of which can be traced back to a single genetic source, a ‘genetic domain’ sequence is created by concatenating the sequences of each chain in the order found in the original gene sequence. Both the original-style library of SCOP sequences and a new library including genetic domain sequences are available. Selected representative subsets of each of these libraries, based on multiple criteria and degrees of similarity, are also included. ASTRAL may be accessed at http://astral.stanford.edu/.
S/MARt DB, the S/MAR transaction database, is a relational database covering scaffold/matrix attached regions (S/MARs) and nuclear matrix proteins that are involved in the chromosomal attachment to the nuclear scaffold. The data are mainly extracted from original publications, but a World Wide Web interface for direct submissions is also available. S/MARt DB is closely linked to the TRANSFAC database on transcription factors and their binding sites. It is freely accessible through the World Wide Web (http://transfac.gbf.de/SMARtDB/) for non-profit research.
HGVbase (Human Genome Variation database; http://hgvbase.cgb.ki.se, formerly known as HGBASE) is an academic effort to provide a high quality and non-redundant database of available genomic variation data of all types, mostly comprising single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Records include neutral polymorphisms as well as disease-related mutations. Online search tools facilitate data interrogation by sequence similarity and keyword queries, and searching by genome coordinates is now being implemented. Downloads are freely available in XML, Fasta, SRS, SQL and tagged-text file formats. Each entry is presented in the context of its surrounding sequence and many records are related to neighboring human genes and affected features therein. Population allele frequencies are included wherever available. Thorough semi-automated data checking ensures internal consistency and addresses common errors in the source information. To keep pace with recent growth in the field, we have developed tools for fully automated annotation. All variants have been uniquely mapped to the draft genome sequence and are referenced to positions in EMBL/GenBank files. Data utility is enhanced by provision of genotyping assays and functional predictions. Recent data structure extensions allow the capture of haplotype and genotype information, and a new initiative (along with BiSC and HUGO-MDI) aims to create a central repository for the broad collection of clinical mutations and associated disease phenotypes of interest.
euGenes is a genome information system and database that provides a common summary of eukaryote genes and genomes, at http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/eugenes/. Seven popular genomes are included: human, mouse, fruitfly, Caenorhabditis elegans worm, Saccharomyces yeast, Arabidopsis mustard weed and zebrafish, with more planned. This information, automatically extracted and updated from several source databases, offers features not readily available through other genome databases to bioscientists looking for gene relationships across organisms. The database describes 150 000 known, predicted and orphan genes, using consistent gene names along with their homologies and associations with a standard vocabulary of molecular functions, cell locations and biological processes. Usable whole-genome maps including features, chromosome locations and molecular data integration are available, as are options to retrieve sequences from these genomes. Search and retrieval methods for these data are easy to use and efficient, allowing one to ask combined questions of sequence features, protein functions and other gene attributes, and fetch results in reports, computable tabular outputs or bulk database forms. These summarized data are useful for integration in other projects, such as gene expression databases. euGenes provides an extensible, flexible genome information system for many organisms.
PALS db is a collection of Putative Alternative Splicing information from 19 936 human UniGene clusters and 16 615 mouse UniGene clusters. Alternative splicing (AS) sites were predicted by using the longest messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence in each UniGene cluster as the reference sequence. This sequence was aligned with related sequences in UniGene and dbEST to reveal the AS. This information was presented with six features: (i) literature aliases were used to improve the result of a gene name search; (ii) the quality of a prediction can be easily judged from the color-coded similarity and the scaled length of an alignment; (iii) we have clustered those EST sequences that support the same AS site together to enhance the users’ confidence on a prediction; (iv) the users can also set up the alignment criteria interactively to recover false negatives; (v) tissue distribution can be displayed by placing the mouse cursor over an alignment; (vi) gene features will be analyzed at foreign sites by submitting the selected mRNA or its encoded protein as a query. Using these features, the users cannot only discover putative AS sites in silico, but also make new observations by combining AS information with tissue distributions or with gene features. PALS db is available at http://palsdb.ym.edu.tw/.
Genew, the Human Gene Nomenclature Database, is the only resource that provides data for all human genes which have approved symbols. It is managed by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) as a confidential database, containing over 16 000 records, 80% of which are represented on the Web by searchable text files. The data in Genew are highly curated by HGNC editors and gene records can be searched on the Web by symbol or name to directly retrieve information on gene symbol, gene name, cytogenetic location, OMIM number and PubMed ID. Data are integrated with other human gene databases, e.g. GDB, LocusLink and SWISS-PROT, and approved gene symbols are carefully co-ordinated with the Mouse Genome Database (MGD). Approved gene symbols are available for querying and browsing at http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nomenclature/searchgenes.pl.
MetaCyc is a metabolic-pathway database that describes 445 pathways and 1115 enzymes occurring in 158 organisms. MetaCyc is a review-level database in that a given entry in MetaCyc often integrates information from multiple literature sources. The pathways in MetaCyc were determined experimentally, and are labeled with the species in which they are known to occur based on literature references examined to date. MetaCyc contains extensive commentary and literature citations. Applications of MetaCyc include pathway analysis of genomes, metabolic engineering and biochemistry education. MetaCyc is queried using the Pathway Tools graphical user interface, which provides a wide variety of query operations and visualization tools. MetaCyc is available via the World Wide Web at http://ecocyc.org/ecocyc/metacyc.html, and is available for local installation as a binary program for the PC and the Sun workstation, and as a set of flatfiles. Contact metacyc-info@ai.sri.com for information on obtaining a local copy of MetaCyc.
The Exon/Intron Database (ExInt) stores information of all GenBank eukaryotic entries containing an annotated intron sequence. Data are available through a retrieval system, as flat-files and as a MySQL dump file. In this report we discuss several implementations added to ExInt, which is accessible at http://intron.bic.nus.edu.sg/exint/newexint/exint.html.
Transcription Regulatory Regions Database (TRRD) is an informational resource containing an integrated description of the gene transcription regulation. An entry of the database corresponds to a gene and contains the data on localization and functions of the transcription regulatory regions as well as gene expression patterns. TRRD contains only experimental data that are inputted into the database through annotating scientific publication. TRRD release 6.0 comprises the information on 1167 genes, 5537 transcription factor binding sites, 1714 regulatory regions, 14 locus control regions and 5335 expression patterns obtained through annotating 3898 scientific papers. This information is arranged in seven databases: TRRDGENES (general gene description), TRRDLCR (locus control regions); TRRDUNITS (regulatory regions: promoters, enhancers, silencers, etc.), TRRDSITES (transcription factor binding sites), TRRDFACTORS (transcription factors), TRRDEXP (expression patterns) and TRRDBIB (experimental publications). Sequence Retrieval System (SRS) is used as a basic tool for navigating and searching TRRD and integrating it with external informational and software resources. The visualization tool, TRRD Viewer, provides the information representation in a form of maps of gene regulatory regions. The option allowing nucleotide sequences to be searched for according to their homology using BLAST is also included. TRRD is available at http://www.bionet.nsc.ru/trrd/.
The Celera Discovery System™ (CDS) is a web-accessible research workbench for mining genomic and related biological information.

The system and academic pricing information are available at http://cds.celera.com.
ASPD is a new curated database that incorporates data on full-length proteins, protein domains and peptides that were obtained through in vitro directed evolution processes (mainly by means of phage display). At present, the ASPD database contains data on 195 selection experiments, which were described in 112 original papers. For each experiment, the following information is given: (i) description of the target for binding, (ii) description of the protein or peptide which serves as the template for library construction and description of the native protein which binds the target, (iii) links to the major proteomic databases (SWISS-PROT, PDB, PROSITE and ENZYME), (iv) keywords referring to the biological significance of the experiment, (v) aligned sequences of proteins or peptides retrieved through in vitro evolution and relevant native or constructed sequences, (vi) the number of rounds of selection/amplification and (vii) the number of occurrences of clones with each sequence. The literature data include a full reference, a link to the MEDLINE database and the name of the corresponding author with his email address. ASPD has a user-friendly interface which allows for simple queries using the names of proteins and ligands, as well as keywords describing the biological role of the interaction studied, and also for queries based on authors’ names. It is also possible to access the database by means of the SRS system, allowing complex queries. There is a BLAST search tool against the ASPD for looking directly for homologous sequences. Research tools of the ASPD allow the analysis of pairwise correlations in the sequences of proteins and peptides selected against one target. The URL for the ASPD database is http://www.sgi.sscc.ru/mgs/gnw/aspd/.
The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) is the community database resource for the laboratory mouse, a key model organism for interpreting the human genome and for understanding human biology and disease (http://www.informatics.jax.org). MGD strives to provide a highly curated, highly integrated information resource that not only includes the consensus view of current knowledge about the mouse, but also provides comparative genomic information particularly for human and rat genomes. MGD includes extensive information about mouse genes, supporting all gene attribute assertions with experimental data, statements of evidence and citation. Detailed information about alleles and mouse mutants includes genotype, molecular variant and phenotype descriptions. Extensive collaboration with other data providers such as NCBI, RIKEN and SWISS-PROT provides standardization of gene:sequence associations and robust interconnections between large information systems based on shared sequence curation. Recent integration of large datasets of mouse full-length cDNAs and radiation-hybrid mapped ESTs, the continued development and use of extensive structured vocabularies and the expansion of the representation of phenotypes highlight this year’s developments.
Although the information of cDNAs is indispensable for analyzing gene function, most of the cDNA sequences stored in current databases are imperfect in the sense that they lack the precise information of 5′ end termini. To overcome this difficulty, we have developed the oligo-capping method to obtain full-length cDNAs, the information of which has been partly deposited in public databases. In this study, we further constructed human cDNA libraries enriched in clones containing the cap structure to systematically explore the 5′ end structure of expressed genes. Of approximately 217 402 5′ end sequences obtained, 111 382 have been matched to cDNA sequences of known genes (7889 genes) and are presented in our new database, DataBase of Transcriptional Start Sites (DBTSS; http://elmo.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/dbtss/). Sequence comparison between our entries and those of a reference sequence database, RefSeq, revealed that 4683 (34%) of RefSeq sequences should be extended towards the 5′ ends. We also mapped each sequence on the human draft genome sequence to identify its transcriptional start site, which provides us with more detailed information on distribution patterns of transcriptional start sites and adjacent regulatory regions.
HOWDY is an integrated database system for accessing and analyzing human genomic information (http://www-alis.tokyo.jst.go.jp/HOWDY/). HOWDY stores information about relationships between genetic objects and the data extracted from a number of databases. HOWDY consists of an Internet accessible user interface that allows thorough searching of the human genomic databases using the gene symbols and their aliases. It also permits flexible editing of the sequence data. The database can be searched using simple words and the search can be restricted to a specific cytogenetic location. Linear maps displaying markers and genes on contig sequences are available, from which an object can be chosen. Any search starting point identifies all the information matching the query. HOWDY provides a convenient search environment of human genomic data for scientists unsure which database is most appropriate for their search.
Large-scale genome projects generate an unprecedented number of protein sequences, most of them are experimentally uncharacterized. Predicting the 3D structures of sequences provides important clues as to their functions. We constructed the Genomes TO Protein structures and functions (GTOP) database, containing protein fold predictions of a huge number of sequences. Predictions are mainly carried out with the homology search program PSI-BLAST, currently the most popular among high-sensitivity profile search methods. GTOP also includes the results of other analyses, e.g. homology and motif search, detection of transmembrane helices and repetitive sequences. We have completed analyzing the sequences of 41 organisms, with the number of proteins exceeding 120 000 in total. GTOP uses a graphical viewer to present the analytical results of each ORF in one page in a ‘color-bar’ format. The assigned 3D structures are presented by Chime plug-in or RasMol. The binding sites of ligands are also included, providing functional information. The GTOP server is available at http://spock.genes.nig.ac.jp/~genome/gtop.html.
The Protein Information Resource (PIR) serves as an integrated public resource of functional annotation of protein data to support genomic/proteomic research and scientific discovery. The PIR, in collaboration with the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) and the Japan International Protein Information Database (JIPID), produces the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database (PSD), the major annotated protein sequence database in the public domain, containing about 250 000 proteins. To improve protein annotation and the coverage of experimentally validated data, a bibliography submission system is developed for scientists to submit, categorize and retrieve literature information. Comprehensive protein information is available from iProClass, which includes family classification at the superfamily, domain and motif levels, structural and functional features of proteins, as well as cross-references to over 40 biological databases. To provide timely and comprehensive protein data with source attribution, we have introduced a non-redundant reference protein database, PIR-NREF. The database consists of about 800 000 proteins collected from PIR-PSD, SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, GenPept, RefSeq and PDB, with composite protein names and literature data. To promote database interoperability, we provide XML data distribution and open database schema, and adopt common ontologies. The PIR web site (http://pir.georgetown.edu/) features data mining and sequence analysis tools for information retrieval and functional identification of proteins based on both sequence and annotation information. The PIR databases and other files are also available by FTP (ftp://nbrfa.georgetown.edu/pir_databases).
Angiogenesis is the formation of new capillaries sprouting from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenesis occurs in a variety of normal physiological and pathological conditions and is regulated by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory angiogenic factors. The control of this balance may fail and result in the formation of a pathologic capillary network during the development of many diseases. Therefore, we developed the angiogenesis database (AngioDB), which can provide a signaling network of angiogenesis-related biomolecules in human. Each record of AngioDB consisted of 12 fields and was developed by using a relational database management system. For the retrieval of data, Active Server Page (ASP) technology was integrated in this system. Users can access the database by a query or imagemap browsing program. The retrieving system also provides a list of angiogenesis-related molecules classified by three categories, and the database has an external link to NCBI databases. AngioDB is available via the Internet at http://angiodb.snu.ac.kr/.
SubtiList is the reference database dedicated to the genome of Bacillus subtilis 168, the paradigm of Gram-positive endospore-forming bacteria. Developed in the framework of the B.subtilis genome project, SubtiList provides a curated dataset of DNA and protein sequences, combined with the relevant annotations and functional assignments. Information about gene functions and products is continuously updated by linking relevant bibliographic references. Recently, sequence corrections arising from both systematic verifications and submissions by individual scientists were included in the reference genome sequence. SubtiList is based on a generic relational data schema and a World Wide Web interface developed for the handling of bacterial genomes, called GenoList. The World Wide Web interface was designed to allow users to easily browse through genome data and retrieve information according to common biological queries. SubtiList also provides more elaborate tools, such as pattern searching, which are tightly connected to the overall browsing system. SubtiList is accessible at http://genolist.pasteur.fr/SubtiList/. Similar bacterial databases are accessible at http://genolist.pasteur.fr/.
Mitochondria, besides their central role in energy metabolism, have recently been found to be involved in a number of basic processes of cell life and to contribute to the pathogenesis of many degenerative diseases. All functions of mitochondria depend on the interaction of nuclear and organelle genomes. Mitochondrial genomes have been extensively sequenced and analysed and data have been collected in several specialised databases. In order to collect information on nuclear coded mitochondrial proteins we developed MitoNuc, a database containing detailed information on sequenced nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial proteins in Metazoa. The MitoNuc database can be retrieved through SRS and is available via the web site http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/mitochondriome where other mitochondrial databases developed by our group, the complete list of the sequenced mitochondrial genomes, links to other mitochondrial sites and related information, are available. The MitoAln database, related to MitoNuc in the previous release, reporting the multiple alignments of the relevant homologous protein coding regions, is no longer supported in the present release. In order to keep the links among entries in MitoNuc from homologous proteins, a new field in the database has been defined: the cluster identifier, an alpha numeric code used to identify each cluster of homologous proteins. A comment field derived from the corresponding SWISS-PROT entry has been introduced; this reports clinical data related to dysfunction of the protein. The logic scheme of MitoNuc database has been implemented in the ORACLE DBMS. This will allow the end-users to retrieve data through a friendly interface that will be soon implemented.
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is the primary database resource of the Japanese GenomeNet service (http://www.genome.ad.jp/) for understanding higher order functional meanings and utilities of the cell or the organism from its genome information. KEGG consists of the PATHWAY database for the computerized knowledge on molecular interaction networks such as pathways and complexes, the GENES database for the information about genes and proteins generated by genome sequencing projects, and the LIGAND database for the information about chemical compounds and chemical reactions that are relevant to cellular processes. In addition to these three main databases, limited amounts of experimental data for microarray gene expression profiles and yeast two-hybrid systems are stored in the EXPRESSION and BRITE databases, respectively. Furthermore, a new database, named SSDB, is available for exploring the universe of all protein coding genes in the complete genomes and for identifying functional links and ortholog groups. The data objects in the KEGG databases are all represented as graphs and various computational methods are developed to detect graph features that can be related to biological functions. For example, the correlated clusters are graph similarities which can be used to predict a set of genes coding for a pathway or a complex, as summarized in the ortholog group tables, and the cliques in the SSDB graph are used to annotate genes. The KEGG databases are updated daily and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/).
The Molecular Biology Database Collection is an online resource listing key databases of value to the biological community. This Collection is intended to bring fellow scientists’ attention to high-quality databases that are available throughout the world, rather than just be a lengthy listing of all available databases. As such, this up-to-date listing is intended to serve as the initial point from which to find specialized databases that may be of use in biological research. The databases included in this Collection provide new value to the underlying data by virtue of curation, new data connections or other innovative approaches. Short, searchable summaries and updates for each of the databases included in the Collection are available through the Nucleic Acids Research Web site at http://nar.oupjournals.org.
Sentra (http://www-wit.mcs.anl.gov/sentra) is a database of signal transduction proteins with the emphasis on microbial signal transduction. The database was updated to include classes of signal transduction systems modulated by either phosphorylation or methylation reactions such as PAS proteins and serine/threonine kinases, as well as the classical two-component histidine kinases and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins. Currently, Sentra contains signal transduction proteins from 43 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes as well as sequences from SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL. Signal transduction proteins are annotated with information describing conserved domains, paralogous and orthologous sequences, and conserved chromosomal gene clusters. The newly developed user interface supports flexible search capabilities and extensive visualization of the data.
The Rat Genome Database (RGD, http://rgd.mcw.edu) is an NIH-funded project whose stated mission is ‘to collect, consolidate and integrate data generated from ongoing rat genetic and genomic research efforts and make these data widely available to the scientific community’. In a collaboration between the Bioinformatics Research Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Jackson Laboratory and the National Center for Biotechnology Information, RGD has been created to meet these stated aims. The rat is uniquely suited to its role as a model of human disease and the primary focus of RGD is to aid researchers in their study of the rat and in applying their results to studies in a wider context. In support of this we have integrated a large amount of rat genetic and genomic resources in RGD and these are constantly being expanded through ongoing literature and bulk dataset curation. RGD version 2.0, released in June 2001, includes curated data on rat genes, quantitative trait loci (QTL), microsatellite markers and rat strains used in genetic and genomic research. VCMap, a dynamic sequence-based homology tool was introduced, and allows researchers of rat, mouse and human to view mapped genes and sequences and their locations in the other two organisms, an essential tool for comparative genomics. In addition, RGD provides tools for gene prediction, radiation hybrid mapping, polymorphic marker selection and more. Future developments will include the introduction of disease-based curation expanding the curated information to cover popular disease systems studied in the rat. This will be integrated with the emerging rat genomic sequence and annotation pipelines to provide a high-quality disease-centric resource, applicable to human and mouse via comparative tools such as VCMap. RGD has a defined community outreach focus with a Visiting Scientist program and the Rat Community Forum, a web-based forum for rat researchers and others interested in using the rat as an experimental model. Thus, RGD is not only a valuable resource for those working with the rat but also for researchers in other model organisms wishing to harness the existing genetic and physiological data available in the rat to complement their own work.
Originating from COMPEL, the TRANSCompel® database emphasizes the key role of specific interactions between transcription factors binding to their target sites providing specific features of gene regulation in a particular cellular content. Composite regulatory elements contain two closely situated binding sites for distinct transcription factors and represent minimal functional units providing combinatorial transcriptional regulation. Both specific factor–DNA and factor–factor interactions contribute to the function of composite elements (CEs). Information about the structure of known CEs and specific gene regulation achieved through such CEs appears to be extremely useful for promoter prediction, for gene function prediction and for applied gene engineering as well. Each database entry corresponds to an individual CE within a particular gene and contains information about two binding sites, two corresponding transcription factors and experiments confirming cooperative action between transcription factors. The COMPEL database, equipped with the search and browse tools, is available at http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/databases.html#transcompel. Moreover, we have developed the program CATCH™ for searching potential CEs in DNA sequences. It is freely available as CompelPatternSearch at http://compel.bionet.nsc.ru/FunSite/CompelPatternSearch.html.
Comparative genomics has shown that ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) contain more copies of many genes than other vertebrates. A large number of these additional genes appear to have been produced during a genome duplication event that occurred early during the evolution of Actinopterygii (i.e. before the teleost radiation). In addition to this ancient genome duplication event, many lineages within Actinopterygii have experienced more recent genome duplications. Here we introduce a curated database named Wanda that lists groups of orthologous genes with one copy from man, mouse and chicken, one or two from tetraploid Xenopus and two or more ancient copies (i.e. paralogs) from ray-finned fish. The database also contains the sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees that were necessary for determining the correct orthologous and paralogous relationships among genes. Where available, map positions and functional data are also reported. The Wanda database should be of particular use to evolutionary and developmental biologists who are interested in the evolutionary and functional divergence of genes after duplication. Wanda is available at http://www.evolutionsbiologie.uni-konstanz.de/Wanda/.
PROSITE [Bairoch and Bucher (1994) Nucleic Acids Res., 22, 3583–3589; Hofmann et al. (1999) Nucleic Acids Res., 27, 215–219] is a method of identifying the functions of uncharacterized proteins translated from genomic or cDNA sequences. The PROSITE database (http://www.expasy.org/prosite/) consists of biologically significant patterns and profiles designed in such a way that with appropriate computational tools it can rapidly and reliably help to determine to which known family of proteins (if any) a new sequence belongs, or which known domain(s) it contains.
A large collection of T-DNA insertion transformants of Arabidopsis thaliana has been generated at the Institute of Agronomic Research, Versailles, France. The molecular characterisation of the insertion sites is currently performed by sequencing genomic regions flanking the inserted T-DNA (FST). The almost complete sequence of the nuclear genome of A.thaliana provides the framework for organising FSTs in a genome oriented database, FLAGdb/FST (http://genoplante-info.infobiogen.fr). The main scope of FLAGdb/FST is to help biologists to find the FSTs that interrupt the genes in which they are interested. FSTs are anchored to the genome sequences of A.thaliana and positions of both predicted genes and FSTs are shown graphically on sequences. Requests to locate the genomic position of a query sequence are made using BLAST programs. The response delivered by FLAGdb/FST is a graphical representation of the putative FSTs and of predicted genes in a 20 kb region.
The Conserved Key Amino Acid Positions DataBase (CKAAPs DB) provides access to an analysis of structurally similar proteins with dissimilar sequences where key residues within a common fold are identified. CKAAPs may be important in protein folding and structural stability and function, and hence useful for protein engineering studies. This paper provides an update to the initial report of CKAAPs DB [Li et al. (2001) Nucleic Acids Res., 29, 329–331]. CKAAPs DB contains CKAAPs for the representative set of polypeptide chains derived from the CE and FSSP databases, as well as subdomains (conserved regions of the order of 100 residues within a domain) identified by CE. The new version now offers different perspectives on the CKAAPs. First, CKAAPs are mapped onto their respective Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures rendered by Molscript, providing a spatial context for the CKAAPs. Secondly, CKAAPs may be highlighted within a structure-based sequence alignment, as well as secondary structure alignment. Thirdly, the resulting sequence homologs from the structure alignment may be viewed in alignments colorized based on identities and property groups using Mview. New search capabilities have also been provided for searching by keyword combinations, PDB IDs, EC numbers, GI numbers, LocusLink ID, taxonomy, gene ontology and pathways. A new custom CKAAPs analysis interface has been implemented where a user may change the criteria for inclusion of chains, initiate CKAAPs analysis and retrieve results. CKAAPs DB is accessible through the web at http://ckaaps.sdsc.edu/. Plain text analysis results are available by FTP at ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/sdsc/biology/ckaap.
VirOligo is a database of virus-specific oligonucleotides. The VirOligo database consists of two tables, Common data and Oligo data. The Oligo data table contains PCR primers and hybridization probes used for detection of viral nucleic acids and the Common data table contains the experimental conditions used in their detection. Each oligonucleotide entry contains links to PubMed, GenBank, NCBI Taxonomy databases and BLAST. As of July 2001, the VirOligo database contains a complete listing of oligonucleotides specific to viral agents associated with bovine respiratory disease that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. The viruses are bovine herpes virus types 1, 3, 4 and 5, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine parainfluenza 3 virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine adenovirus, bovine rhinovirus, bovine coronavirus, bovine reovirus, bovine enterovirus and alcelaphine herpesvirus-1. The VirOligo database is being expanded to other viruses and can be accessed through the Internet at http://viroligo.okstate.edu/.
SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool, http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de) is a web-based resource used for the annotation of protein domains and the analysis of domain architectures, with particular emphasis on mobile eukaryotic domains. Extensive annotation for each domain family is available, providing information relating to function, subcellular localization, phyletic distribution and tertiary structure. The January 2002 release has added more than 200 hand-curated domain models. This brings the total to over 600 domain families that are widely represented among nuclear, signalling and extracellular proteins. Annotation now includes links to the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database in cases where a human disease is associated with one or more mutations in a particular domain. We have implemented new analysis methods and updated others. New advanced queries provide direct access to the SMART relational database using SQL. This database now contains information on intrinsic sequence features such as transmembrane regions, coiled-coils, signal peptides and internal repeats. SMART output can now be easily included in users’ documents. A SMART mirror has been created at http://smart.ox.ac.uk.
Complex carbohydrates are known as mediators of complex cellular events. Concerning their structural diversity, their potential of information content is several orders of magnitude higher in a short sequence than any other biological macromolecule. SWEET-DB (http://www.dkfz.de/spec2/sweetdb/) is an attempt to use modern web techniques to annotate and/or cross-reference carbohydrate-related data collections which allow glycoscientists to find important data for compounds of interest in a compact and well-structured representation. Currently, reference data taken from three data sources can be retrieved for a given carbohydrate (sub)structure. The sources are CarbBank structures and literature references (linked to NCBI PubMed service), NMR data taken from SugaBase and 3D co-ordinates generated with SWEET-II. The main purpose of SWEET-DB is to enable an easy access to all data stored for one carbohydrate structure entering a complete sequence or parts thereof. Access to SWEET-DB contents is provided with the help of separate input spreadsheets for (sub)structures, bibliographic data, general structural data like molecular weight, NMR spectra and biological data. A detailed online tutorial is available at http://www.dkfz.de/spec2/sweetdb/nar/.
The PRINTS database houses a collection of protein fingerprints. These may be used to make family and tentative functional assignments for uncharacterised sequences. The September 2001 release (version 32.0) includes 1600 fingerprints, encoding ∼10 000 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides and so on. In addition to its continued steady growth, we report here its use as a source of annotation in the InterPro resource, and the use of its relational cousin, PRINTS-S, to model relationships between families, including those beyond the reach of conventional sequence analysis approaches. The database is accessible for BLAST, fingerprint and text searches at http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/dbbrowser/PRINTS/.
An extensive effort of the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) has resulted in rapid accumulation of genome sequence, and >137 Mb has already been made available to the public domain as of August 2001. This requires a high-throughput annotation scheme to extract biologically useful and timely information from the sequence data on a regular basis. A new automated annotation system and database called Rice Genome Automated Annotation System (RiceGAAS) has been developed to execute a reliable and up-to-date analysis of the genome sequence as well as to store and retrieve the results of annotation. The system has the following functional features: (i) collection of rice genome sequences from GenBank; (ii) execution of gene prediction and homology search programs; (iii) integration of results from various analyses and automatic interpretation of coding regions; (iv) re-execution of analysis, integration and automatic interpretation with the latest entries in reference databases; (v) integrated visualization of the stored data using web-based graphical view. RiceGAAS also has a data submission mechanism that allows public users to perform fully automated annotation of their own sequences. The system can be accessed at http://RiceGAAS.dna.affrc.go.jp/.
The Conserved Domain Database (CDD) is a compilation of multiple sequence alignments representing protein domains conserved in molecular evolution. It has been populated with alignment data from the public collections Pfam and SMART, as well as with contributions from colleagues at NCBI. The current version of CDD (v.1.54) contains 3693 such models. CDD alignments are linked to protein sequence and structure data in Entrez. The molecular structure viewer Cn3D serves as a tool to interactively visualize alignments and three-dimensional structure, and to link three-dimensional residue coordinates to descriptions of evolutionary conservation. CDD can be accessed on the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml. Protein query sequences may be compared against databases of position-specific score matrices derived from alignments in CDD, using a service named CD-Search, which can be found at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi. CD-Search runs reverse-position-specific BLAST (RPS-BLAST), a variant of the widely used PSI-BLAST algorithm. CD-Search is run by default for protein–protein queries submitted to NCBI’s BLAST service at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST.
FlyBase (http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/) provides an integrated view of the fundamental genomic and genetic data on the major genetic model Drosophila melanogaster and related species. Following on the success of the Drosophila genome project, FlyBase has primary responsibility for the continual reannotation of the D.melanogaster genome. The ultimate goal of the reannotation effort is to decorate the euchromatic sequence of the genome with as much biological information as is available from the community and from the major genome project centers. The current cycle of reannotation focuses on establishing a comprehensive data set of gene models (i.e. transcription units and CDSs). There are many points of entry to the genome within FlyBase, most notably through maps, gene ontologies, structured phenotypic and gene expression data, and anatomy.
FUGOID is a web-based, taxonomically broad organelle intron database that collects and integrates various functional and structural data on organellar (mitochondrial and chloroplast) introns. The main information provided by FUGOID includes intron sequence, subclass, resident ORF, self-splicing capability, host gene, protein factor(s) involved in splicing, mobility, insertion site, twintron, seminal references and taxonomic position of host organism. It is implemented in a relational database management system, allowing sophisticated, user-friendly searching, data entry and revision. Users can access the database by any common web browser using a variety of operating systems. The main page of the database is available at http://wnt.cc.utexas.edu/~ifmr530/introndata/main.htm.
A number of proteins and nucleic acids have been explored as therapeutic targets. These targets are subjects of interest in different areas of biomedical and pharmaceutical research and in the development and evaluation of bioinformatics, molecular modeling, computer-aided drug design and analytical tools. A publicly accessible database that provides comprehensive information about these targets is therefore helpful to the relevant communities. The Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) is designed to provide information about the known therapeutic protein and nucleic acid targets described in the literature, the targeted disease conditions, the pathway information and the corresponding drugs/ligands directed at each of these targets. Cross-links to other databases are also introduced to facilitate the access of information about the sequence, 3D structure, function, nomenclature, drug/ligand binding properties, drug usage and effects, and related literature for each target. This database can be accessed at http://xin.cz3.nus.edu.sg/group/ttd/ttd.asp and it currently contains entries for 433 targets covering 125 disease conditions along with 809 drugs/ligands directed at each of these targets. Each entry can be retrieved through multiple methods including target name, disease name, drug/ligand name, drug/ligand function and drug therapeutic classification.
The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (aka EMBL-Bank; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/) incorporates, organises and distributes nucleotide sequences from all available public sources. EMBL-Bank is located and maintained at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) near Cambridge, UK. In an international collaboration with DDBJ (Japan) and GenBank (USA), data are exchanged amongst the collaborating databases on a daily basis. Major contributors to the EMBL database are individual scientists and genome project groups. Webin is the preferred web-based submission system for individual submitters, whilst automatic procedures allow incorporation of sequence data from large-scale genome sequencing centres and from the European Patent Office (EPO). Database releases are produced quarterly. Network services allow free access to the most up-to-date data collection via FTP, email and World Wide Web interfaces. EBI’s Sequence Retrieval System (SRS), a network browser for databanks in molecular biology, integrates and links the main nucleotide and protein databases plus many other specialized databases. For sequence similarity searching, a variety of tools (e.g. Blitz, Fasta, BLAST) are available which allow external users to compare their own sequences against the latest data in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database and SWISS-PROT. All resources can be accessed via the EBI home page at http://www.ebi.ac.uk.
yMGV (yeast Microarray Global Viewer) was designed to provide biologists with meaningful information from genome-wide yeast expression data. The database includes most of the available expression data published on yeast microarrays over the last 4 years. It provides customizable tools for the rapid visualization of expression profiles associated with a set of genes from all published experiments. It also allows users to compare the results from different publications so that they can identify genes with common expression profiles. We used yMGV to perform global analyses to find a gene expression profile specific for given biological conditions and to locate functional gene clusters on chromosomes. Other organisms will be added to this database. yMGV is accessible on the web at http://transcriptome.ens.fr/ymgv.
The Structural Classification of RNA (SCOR) database provides a survey of the three-dimensional motifs contained in 259 NMR and X-ray RNA structures. In one classification, the structures are grouped according to function. The RNA motifs, including internal and external loops, are also organized in a hierarchical classification. The 259 database entries contain 223 internal and 203 external loops; 52 entries consist of fully complementary duplexes. A classification of the well-characterized tertiary interactions found in the larger RNA structures is also included along with examples. The SCOR database is accessible at http://scor.lbl.gov.
The current deluge of genomic sequences has spawned the creation of tools capable of making sense of the data. Computational and high-throughput experimental methods for generating links between proteins have recently been emerging. These methods effectively act as hypothesis machines, allowing researchers to screen large sets of data to detect interesting patterns that can then be studied in greater detail. Although the potential use of these putative links in predicting gene function has been demonstrated, a central repository for all such links for many genomes would maximize their usefulness. Here we present Predictome, a database of predicted links between the proteins of 44 genomes based on the implementation of three computational methods—chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic profiling and domain fusion—and large-scale experimental screenings of protein–protein interaction data. The combination of data from various predictive methods in one database allows for their comparison with each other, as well as visualization of their correlation with known pathway information. As a repository for such data, Predictome is an ongoing resource for the community, providing functional relationships among proteins as new genomic data emerges. Predictome is available at http://predictome.bu.edu.
The HOX Pro database contains information about the organization, function and evolution of gene ensembles, notably the homeobox-containing genes. It is now clear that a subset of genes containing the homeobox motif play key roles in the orchestration of genes which control embryonic patterning, morphogenesis, cell differentiation and malignant transformation. The HOX Pro contains a broad spectrum of information including images, diagrams and animations. Currently this amounts to approximately 700 HTML pages together with 400 images which contain information on 200 groups of genes and 90 promoters, in turn linked to maps of 13 HOX clusters and nine genetic networks. There are about 700 sequences of individual hox-genes of animals classified in approximately 200 homologous or paralogous groups. Graphical representation of HOX clusters and Hox-based networks is accomplished by means of flow and 3D diagrams, JavaScript animations and Java applets. The HOX Pro now includes sections presenting data mining and data simulation issues. The DB is located at http://www.iephb.nw.ru/hoxpro.
High-density oligonucleotide arrays are a powerful tool for uncovering changes in global gene expression in various disease states. To this end, it is essential to first characterize the variations of gene expression in normal physiological processes. We established the Human Gene Expression (HuGE) Index database (www.HugeIndex.org) to serve as a public repository for gene expression data on normal human tissues using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. This resource currently contains the results of 59 gene expression experiments on 19 human tissues. We provide interactive tools for researchers to query and visualize our data over the Internet. To facilitate data analysis, we cross-reference each gene on the array with its annotation in the LocusLink database at NCBI.
PLANT-PIs is a database developed to facilitate retrieval of information on plant protease inhibitors (PIs) and related genes. For each PI, links to sequence databases are reported together with a summary of the functional properties of the molecule (and its mutants) as deduced from literature. PLANT-PIs contains information for 351 plant PIs, plus several isoinhibitors. The database is accessible at http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/PLANT-PIs.
Transterm is a database that facilitates studies of translation and the translational control of protein synthesis. It contains a curated collection of elements in mRNAs that control translation, and biologically relevant mRNA regions extracted from GenBank. It is organised largely on a taxonomic basis with files and summaries for each species. Global patterns that may affect translation in particular species, for example bias in the context of initiation codons (Kozak’s consensus or Shine–Dalgarno sequences) or termination codons, can be detected in the consensus and information content bias summaries. Several types of access are provided via a web browser interface. Transterm defined elements may be matched in a user’s sequence or in the database. Alternatively, elements can be entered by the user to search specific sections of the database (for example, coding regions or 3′ flanking regions or the 3′-UTRs) or the user’s sequence. Each Transterm defined element has an associated biological description with references. The database is accessible at http://uther.otago.ac.nz/Transterm.html.
MODBASE (http://guitar.rockefeller.edu/modbase) is a relational database of annotated comparative protein structure models for all available protein sequences matched to at least one known protein structure. The models are calculated by MODPIPE, an automated modeling pipeline that relies on PSI-BLAST, IMPALA and MODELLER. MODBASE uses the MySQL relational database management system for flexible and efficient querying, and the MODVIEW Netscape plugin for viewing and manipulating multiple sequences and structures. It is updated regularly to reflect the growth of the protein sequence and structure databases, as well as improvements in the software for calculating the models. For ease of access, MODBASE is organized into different datasets. The largest dataset contains models for domains in 304 517 out of 539 171 unique protein sequences in the complete TrEMBL database (23 March 2001); only models based on significant alignments (PSI-BLAST E-value < 10–4) and models assessed to have the correct fold are included. Other datasets include models for target selection and structure-based annotation by the New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium, models for prediction of genes in the Drosophila melanogaster genome, models for structure determination of several ribosomal particles and models calculated by the MODWEB comparative modeling web server.
We have been developing a HUGE database to summarize results from the sequence analysis of human novel large (>4 kb) cDNAs identified in the Kazusa cDNA sequencing project, systematically designated KIAA plus a four-digit number. HUGE currently contains nearly 2000 gene/protein characteristic tables harboring the results of the computer-assisted analysis of the cDNA and the predicted protein sequences together with those of expression profiling and chromosomal mapping. In the updated version of HUGE, we made it possible to compare each KIAA cDNA sequence with the corresponding entry in the human draft genome sequence that was published recently. Approximately 90% of KIAA cDNAs in HUGE can be localized along the human genome for at least half or more of the cDNA’s length. Any nucleotide differences between the cDNA and the corresponding genomic sequences are also presented in detail. This new version of HUGE greatly helps us evaluate the completeness of cDNA clones and the accuracy of cDNA/genomic sequences. More interestingly, in some cases, the ability to compare cDNA with genomic sequences allows us to identify candidate sites of RNA editing. HUGE is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/huge.
EcoCyc is an organism-specific pathway/genome database that describes the metabolic and signal-transduction pathways of Escherichia coli, its enzymes, its transport proteins and its mechanisms of transcriptional control of gene expression. EcoCyc is queried using the Pathway Tools graphical user interface, which provides a wide variety of query operations and visualization tools. EcoCyc is available at http://ecocyc.org/.
The Prostate Expression Databases (PEDB and mPEDB) are online resources designed to allow researchers to access and analyze gene expression information derived from the human and murine prostate, respectively. Human PEDB archives more than 84 000 Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from 38 prostate cDNA libraries in a curated relational database that provides detailed library information including tissue source, library construction methods, sequence diversity and sequence abundance. The differential expression of each EST species can be viewed across all libraries using a Virtual Expression Analysis Tool (VEAT), a graphical user interface written in Java for intra- and inter-library sequence comparisons. Recent enhancements to PEDB include (i) the development of a murine prostate expression database, mPEDB, that complements the human gene expression information in PEDB, (ii) the assembly of a non-redundant sequence set or ‘prostate unigene’ that represents the diversity of gene expression in the prostate, and (iii) an expanded search tool that supports both text-based and BLAST queries. PEDB and mPEDB are accessible via the World Wide Web at http://www.pedb.org and http://www.mpedb.org.
The GenBank sequence database incorporates publicly available DNA sequences of more than 105 000 different organisms, primarily through direct submission of sequence data from individual laboratories and large-scale sequencing projects. Most submissions are made using the BankIt (web) or Sequin programs and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank staff upon receipt. Data exchange with the EMBL Data Library and the DNA Data Bank of Japan helps ensure comprehensive worldwide coverage. GenBank data is accessible through NCBI’s integrated retrieval system, Entrez, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical literature via PubMed. Sequence similarity searching is provided by the BLAST family of programs. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. NCBI also offers a wide range of World Wide Web retrieval and analysis services based on GenBank data. The GenBank database and related resources are freely accessible via the NCBI home page at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
The human endogenous retroviruses database (HERVd) is maintained at the Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, and is accessible via the World Wide Web at http://herv.img.cas.cz. The HERVd provides complex information on and analysis of retroviral elements found in the human genome. It can be used for searches of individual HERV families, identification of HERV parts, graphical output of HERV structures, comparison of HERVs and identification of retrovirus integration sites.
The current release of ProTherm, Thermodynamic Database for Proteins and Mutants, contains more than 10 000 numerical data (300% of the first version) of several thermodynamic parameters, experimental methods and conditions, reversibility of folding, details about the surrounding residues in space for all mutants, structural, functional and literature information. In the current version, we have added information about the source of each protein, identification codes for SWISS-PROT and Protein Information Resource and unique Protein Data Bank (PDB) code for proteins with relevant source. We have also provided additional options to search for data based on PDB code, number of states and reversibility. ProTherm is cross-linked with other sequence, structural, functional and literature databases, and the mutant sites and surrounding residues are automatically mapped on the structure. The ProTherm database is freely available at http://www.rtc.riken.go.jp/jouhou/protherm/protherm.html.
FANTOM DB, the database of Functional Annotation of RIKEN Mouse cDNA Clones, is designed to store sequence information of RIKEN full-length enriched mouse cDNA clones, graphical views of sequence analysis results, curated functional annotation information and additional descriptions, including Gene Ontology terms. RIKEN’s Mouse Gene Encyclopedia Project aims to collect full-length enriched cDNA clones from various mouse tissues, determine the full-length nucleotide sequences, infer their chromosomal locations by computer and characterize gene expression patterns. FANTOM DB has been developed to facilitate this work and to facilitate functional genomic studies such as positional candidate cloning, cDNA microarrays and protein interaction analyses. FANTOM DB contains 21 076 full-length cDNA sequences with rich functional annotations and is publicly available. FANTOM DB thus provides curated functional annotation to RIKEN full-length enriched mouse clones, and has links to other public resources. FANTOM DB can be accessed at http://fantom.gsc.riken.go.jp/db/.
The secondary and tertiary structure of an RNA molecule typically includes a number of non-canonical base–base interactions. The known occurrences of these interactions are tabulated in the NCIR database, which can be accessed from http://prion.bchs.uh.edu/bp_type/. The number of examples is now over 1400, which is an increase of >700% since the database was first published. This dramatic increase reflects the addition of data from the recently published crystal structures of the 50S (2.4 Å) and 30S (3.0 Å) ribosomal subunits. In addition, non-canonical interactions observed in published crystal and NMR structures of tRNAs, group I introns, ribozymes, RNA aptamers and synthetic oligonucleotides are included. Properties associated with these interactions, such as sequence context, sugar pucker conformation, glycosidic angle conformation, melting temperature, chemical shift and free energy, are also reported when available. Out of the 29 anticipated pairs with at least two hydrogen bonds, 28 have been observed to date. In addition, several novel examples, not generally predicted, have also been encountered, bringing the total of such pairs to 36. Added to this list are a variety of single, bifurcated, triple and quadruple interactions. The most common non-canonical pairs are the sheared GA, GA imino, AU reverse Hoogsteen, and the GU and AC wobble pairs. The most frequent triple interaction connects N3 of an A with the amino of a G that is also involved in a standard Watson–Crick pair.
The SUPERFAMILY database contains a library of hidden Markov models representing all proteins of known structure. The database is based on the SCOP ‘superfamily’ level of protein domain classification which groups together the most distantly related proteins which have a common evolutionary ancestor. There is a public server at http://supfam.org which provides three services: sequence searching, multiple alignments to sequences of known structure, and structural assignments to all complete genomes. Given an amino acid or nucleotide query sequence the server will return the domain architecture and SCOP classification. The server produces alignments of the query sequences with sequences of known structure, and includes multiple alignments of genome and PDB sequences. The structural assignments are carried out on all complete genomes (currently 59) covering approximately half of the soluble protein domains. The assignments, superfamily breakdown and statistics on them are available from the server. The database is currently used by this group and others for genome annotation, structural genomics, gene prediction and domain-based genomic studies.
Inteins are self-catalytic protein splicing elements. InBase (http://www.neb.com/neb/inteins.html), the Intein Database and Registry, is a curated compilation of published and unpublished information about protein splicing. It presents general information as well as detailed data for each intein, including tabulated comparisons and a comprehensive bibliography. An intein-specific BLAST server is now available to assist in identifying new inteins.
BRENDA is a comprehensive relational database on functional and molecular information of enzymes, based on primary literature. The database contains information extracted and evaluated from approximately 46 000 references, holding data of at least 40 000 different enzymes from more than 6900 different organisms, classified in approximately 3900 EC numbers. BRENDA is an important tool for biochemical and medical research covering information on properties of all classified enzymes, including data on the occurrence, catalyzed reaction, kinetics, substrates/products, inhibitors, cofactors, activators, structure and stability. All data are connected to literature references which in turn are linked to PubMed. The data and information provide a fundamental tool for research of enzyme mechanisms, metabolic pathways, the evolution of metabolism and, furthermore, for medicinal diagnostics and pharmaceutical research. The database is a resource for data of enzymes, classified according to the EC system of the IUBMB Enzyme Nomenclature Committee, and the entries are cross-referenced to other databases, i.e. organism classification, protein sequence, protein structure and literature references. BRENDA provides an academic web access at http://www.brenda.uni-koeln.de.
The SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) database is a comprehensive ordering of all proteins of known structure, according to their evolutionary and structural relationships. Protein domains in SCOP are grouped into species and hierarchically classified into families, superfamilies, folds and classes. Recently, we introduced a new set of features with the aim of standardizing access to the database, and providing a solid basis to manage the increasing number of experimental structures expected from structural genomics projects. These features include: a new set of identifiers, which uniquely identify each entry in the hierarchy; a compact representation of protein domain classification; a new set of parseable files, which fully describe all domains in SCOP and the hierarchy itself. These new features are reflected in the ASTRAL compendium. The SCOP search engine has also been updated, and a set of links to external resources added at the level of domain entries. SCOP can be accessed at http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop.
Dictyostelium is an attractive model system for the study of mechanisms basic to cellular function or complex multicellular developmental processes. Recent advances in Dictyostelium genomics have generated a wide spectrum of resources. However, much of the current genomic sequence information is still not currently available through GenBank or related databases. Thus, many investigators are unaware that extensive sequence data from Dictyostelium has been compiled, or of its availability and access. Here, we discuss progress in Dictyostelium genomics and gene annotation, and highlight the primary portals for sequence access, manipulation and analysis (http://genome.imb-jena.de/dictyostelium/; http://dictygenome.bcm.tmc.edu/; http://www.sanger. ac.uk/Projects/D_discoideum/; http://www.csm.biol. tsukuba.ac.jp/cDNAproject.html).
The searchable mutant database tGRAP (previously called tinyGRAP) at the University of Tromsø contains data on mutated G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). All data have been extracted from scientific papers and entered manually into the database. The current version of the tGRAP mutant database (tGRAP.uit.no, release 10, April 2001) contains around 10 500 mutants extracted from almost 1400 research papers containing mutant data on five families of GPCRs, i.e. Family A, rhodopsin-like; Family B, secretin-like; Family C, metabotropic glutamate-like; Family D, pheromone; Family E, cAMP receptors. A query form provides rapid and simple access to relevant mutant information. In addition to this query form, a tool that enables the user to access mutation data via sequence alignments has been introduced. The ability to access mutant data from such alignments increases the usefulness of the mutant database and facilitates comparison of mutagenesis data between receptors. Moreover, this tool allows the construction of tailor-made sequence alignment views from any combination of receptors belonging to the same class. The database is available at http://tGRAP.uit.no/.
SBASE (http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/sbase) is an online resource of protein domain sequences designed to facilitate detection of domain homologies based on a simple database search. The ninth release of the SBASE library of protein domain sequences contains 320 000 annotated structural, functional, ligand-binding and topogenic segments of proteins clustered into over 3481 domain groups and 483 protein families. Domain identification and functional prediction are based on a comparison of BLAST search outputs with a knowledge base of within-group (‘self’) and out-of-group (‘non-self’) similarities of the known domain groups. This is a memory-based approach wherein class-specific similarity functions are automatically learned from the database [Stanfill,C. and Waltz,D. (1986) Commun. ACM, 29, 1213–1228].
The GeneNet database is designed for accumulation of information on gene networks. Original technology applied in GeneNet enables description of not only a gene network structure and functional relationships between components, but also metabolic and signal transduction pathways. Specialised software, GeneNet Viewer, automatically displays the graphical diagram of gene networks described in the database. Current release 3.0 of GeneNet database contains descriptions of 25 gene networks, 945 proteins, 567 genes, 151 other substances and 1364 relationships between components of gene networks. Information distributed between 14 interlinked tables was obtained by annotating 968 scientific publications. The SRS-version of GeneNet database is freely available (http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/systems/genenet/).
The ImmunoDeficiency Resource (IDR), freely available at http://www.uta.fi/imt/bioinfo/idr/, is a comprehensive knowledge base on immunodeficiencies. It is designed for different user groups such as researchers, physicians and nurses as well as patients and their families and the general public. Information on immunodeficiencies is stored as fact files, which are disease- and gene-based information resources. We have developed an inherited disease markup language (IDML) data model, which is designed for storing disease- and gene-specific data in extensible markup language (XML) format. The fact files written by the IDML can be used to present data in different contexts and platforms. All the information in the IDR is validated by expert curators.
Three-dimensional structures are now known within many protein families and it is quite likely, in searching a sequence database, that one will encounter a homolog with known structure. The goal of Entrez’s 3D-structure database is to make this information, and the functional annotation it can provide, easily accessible to molecular biologists. To this end Entrez’s search engine provides three powerful features. (i) Sequence and structure neighbors; one may select all sequences similar to one of interest, for example, and link to any known 3D structures. (ii) Links between databases; one may search by term matching in MEDLINE, for example, and link to 3D structures reported in these articles. (iii) Sequence and structure visualization; identifying a homolog with known structure, one may view molecular-graphic and alignment displays, to infer approximate 3D structure. In this article we focus on two features of Entrez’s Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB) not described previously: links from individual biopolymer chains within 3D structures to a systematic taxonomy of organisms represented in molecular databases, and links from individual chains (and compact 3D domains within them) to structure neighbors, other chains (and 3D domains) with similar 3D structure. MMDB may be accessed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Structure.
The Proteome Division of Incyte Genomics has released new volumes to the BioKnowledge® Library to add human, mouse and rat protein information to its rich collection of model organism Proteome Databases. The Human Proteome Survey Database (HumanPSD™) compiles the fundamental properties of more than 25 000 characterized mammalian proteins. HumanPSD™ includes clear, concise and current protein descriptions (Title Lines), the protein sequence, calculated physical properties, precomputed BLAST alignments, controlled-vocabulary protein properties and Gene Ontology™ terms, and a list of published references. Each report also contains expression data, Pfam domain information and an associated Mouse Mutant Phenotype section describing behavioral, physiological and cellular phenotypes for over 1500 mouse mutant phenotypes. GPCR-PD™ contains more than 3200 Protein Reports from the three mammalian species for G protein-coupled receptors, their protein ligands, associated G-proteins and their downstream signaling proteins. In addition to the features described above, each GPCR-PD Protein Report displays annotations of experimental findings from over 10 000 publications. These databases provide important new volumes of Proteome’s BioKnowledge Library (http://www.incyte.com), integrating protein information from model organisms with the human proteome.
EXProt is a non-redundant protein database containing a selection of entries from genome annotation projects and public databases, aimed at including only proteins with an experimentally verified function. In EXProt release 2.0 we have collected entries from the Pseudomonas aeruginosa community annotation project (PseudoCAP), the Escherichia coli genome and proteome database (GenProtEC) and the translated coding sequences from the Prokaryotes division of EMBL nucleotide sequence database, which are described as having an experimentally verified function. Each entry in EXProt has a unique ID number and contains information about the species, amino acid sequence, functional annotation and, in most cases, links to references in MEDLINE/PubMed and to the entry in the original database. EXProt is indexed in SRS at CMBI (http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/srs/) and can be searched with BLAST and FASTA through the EXProt web page (http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/EXProt/).
We have created a federated database for genome studies of Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, by integrating end sequence data from BAC clones, genetic marker data and BAC contig assembly data. A library of 9216 BAC clones providing >25-fold coverage of the entire genome was end sequenced and fingerprinted by HindIIIdigestion. The Image/FPC software package was then used to generate an assembly of 188 contigs covering >95% of the genome. The database contains the results of this assembly integrated with hybridization data of genetic markers to the BAC library. AceDB was used for the core database engine and a MySQL relational database, populated with numerical representations of BAC clones within FPC contigs, was used to create appropriately scaled images. The database is being used to facilitate sequencing efforts. The database also allows researchers mapping known genes or other sequences of interest, rapid and easy access to the fundamental organization of the M.grisea genome. This database, MagnaportheDB, can be accessed on the web at http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/fungal_genomics/mgdatabase/int.htm.
Ribosomal 5S RNA (5S rRNA) is an integral component of the large ribosomal subunit in all known organisms with the exception only of mitochondrial ribosomes of fungi and animals. It is thought to enhance protein synthesis by stabilization of a ribosome structure. This paper presents the updated database of 5S rRNA and their genes (5S rDNA). Its short characteristics are presented in the Introduction. The database contains 2280 primary structures of 5S rRNA and 5S rRNA genes. These include 536 eubacterial, 61 archaebacterial, 1611 eukaryotic and 72 organelle sequences. The database is available on line through the World Wide Web at http://biobases.ibch.poznan.pl/5SData/.
Genome Information Broker (GIB) is a powerful tool for the study of comparative genomics. GIB allows users to retrieve and display partial and/or whole genome sequences together with the relevant biological annotation. GIB has accumulated all the completed microbial genome and has recently been expanded to include Arabidopsis thaliana genome data from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. In the near future, hundreds of genome sequences will be determined. In order to handle such huge data, we have enhanced the GIB architecture by using XML, CORBA and distributed RDBs. We introduce the new GIB here. GIB is freely accessible at http://gib.genes.nig.ac.jp/.
The Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS-GSF, Neuherberg, Germany) continues to provide genome-related information in a systematic way. MIPS supports both national and European sequencing and functional analysis projects, develops and maintains automatically generated and manually annotated genome-specific databases, develops systematic classification schemes for the functional annotation of protein sequences, and provides tools for the comprehensive analysis of protein sequences. This report updates the information on the yeast genome (CYGD), the Neurospora crassa genome (MNCDB), the databases for the comprehensive set of genomes (PEDANT genomes), the database of annotated human EST clusters (HIB), the database of complete cDNAs from the DHGP (German Human Genome Project), as well as the project specific databases for the GABI (Genome Analysis in Plants) and HNB (Helmholtz–Netzwerk Bioinformatik) networks. The Arabidospsis thaliana database (MATDB), the database of mitochondrial proteins (MITOP) and our contribution to the PIR International Protein Sequence Database have been described elsewhere [Schoof et al. (2002) Nucleic Acids Res., 30, 91–93; Scharfe et al. (2000) Nucleic Acids Res., 28, 155–158; Barker et al. (2001) Nucleic Acids Res., 29, 29–32]. All databases described, the protein analysis tools provided and the detailed descriptions of our projects can be accessed through the MIPS World Wide Web server (http://mips.gsf.de).
The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ, http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) has made an effort to collect as much data as possible mainly from Japanese researchers. The increase rates of the data we collected, annotated and released to the public in the past year are 43% for the number of entries and 52% for the number of bases. The increase rates are accelerated even after the human genome was sequenced, because sequencing technology has been remarkably advanced and simplified, and research in life science has been shifted from the gene scale to the genome scale. In addition, we have developed the Genome Information Broker (GIB, http://gib.genes.nig.ac.jp) that now includes more than 50 complete microbial genome and Arabidopsis genome data. We have also developed a database of the human genome, the Human Genomics Studio (HGS, http://studio.nig.ac.jp). HGS provides one with a set of sequences being as continuous as possible in any one of the 24 chromosomes. Both GIB and HGS have been updated incorporating newly available data and retrieval tools.
LIGAND is a composite database comprising three sections: COMPOUND for the information about metabolites and other chemical compounds, REACTION for the collection of substrate–product relations representing metabolic and other reactions, and ENZYME for the information about enzyme molecules. The current release (as of September 7, 2001) includes 7298 compounds, 5166 reactions and 3829 enzymes. In addition to the keyword search provided by the DBGET/LinkDB system, a substructure search to the COMPOUND and REACTION sections is now available through the World Wide Web (http://www.genome.ad.jp/ligand/). LIGAND may be also downloaded by anonymous FTP (ftp://ftp.genome.ad.jp/pub/kegg/ligand/).
The Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.pdb.org/) is the single worldwide archive of structural data of biological macromolecules. This paper describes the progress that has been made in validating all data in the PDB archive and in releasing a uniform archive for the community. We have now produced a collection of mmCIF data files for the PDB archive (ftp://beta.rcsb.org/pub/pdb/uniformity/data/mmCIF/). A utility application that converts the mmCIF data files to the PDB format (called CIFTr) has also been released to provide support for existing software.
The European database on SSU rRNA can be consulted via the World WideWeb at http://rrna.uia.ac.be/ssu/ and compiles all complete or nearly complete small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences. Sequences are provided in aligned format. The alignment takes into account the secondary structure information derived by comparative sequence analysis of thousands of sequences. Additional information such as literature references, taxonomy, secondary structure models and nucleotide variability maps, is also available.
Histone proteins are often noted for their high degree of sequence conservation. It is less often recognized that the histones are a heterogeneous protein family. Furthermore, several classes of non-histone proteins containing the histone fold motif exist. Novel histone and histone fold protein sequences continue to be added to public databases every year. The Histone Database (http://genome.nhgri.nih.gov/histones/) is a searchable, periodically updated collection of histone fold-containing sequences derived from sequence-similarity searches of public databases. Sequence sets are presented in redundant and non-redundant FASTA form, hotlinked to GenBank sequence files. Partial sequences are also now included in the database, which has considerably augmented its taxonomic coverage. Annotated alignments of full-length non-redundant sets of sequences are now available in both web-viewable (HTML) and downloadable (PDF) formats. The database also provides summaries of current information on solved histone fold structures, post-translational modifications of histones, and the human histone gene complement.
The IMB Jena Image Library of Biological Macromolecules (http://www.imb-jena.de/IMAGE.html) is aimed at a better dissemination of information on three-dimensional biopolymer structures with an emphasis on visualization and analysis. It provides access to all structure entries deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Nucleic Acid Database (NDB). In addition, basic information on the architecture of biological macromolecules is offered. Recent developments include a site database and an analysis tool that identifies all residues surrounding hetero components or sites according to geometrical criteria. This enables one to search for all structures with a certain pattern of amino acids/nucleotides/water adjacent to hetero components or sites. A new PDB/SWISS-PROT cross-reference database combines information from both PDB and SWISS-PROT, thus providing significantly more cross-references than either PDB or SWISS-PROT. The existing brief descriptions of X-ray, NMR and FTIR methods for structure determination are supplemented by information on circular dichroism.
SELEX_DB is an online resource containing both the experimental data on in vitro selected DNA/RNA oligomers (aptamers) and the applets for recognition of these oligomers. Since in vitro experimental data are evidently system-dependent, the new release of the SELEX_DB has been supplemented by the database SYSTEM storing the experimental design. In addition, the recognition applet package, SELEX_TOOLS, applying in vitro selected data to annotation of the genome DNA, is accompanied by the cross-validation test database CROSS_TEST discriminating the sites (natural or other) related to in vitro selected sites out of random DNA. By cross-validation testing, we have unexpectedly observed that the recognition accuracy increases with the growth of homology between the training and test sets of protein binding sequences. For natural sites, the recognition accuracy was lower than that for the nearest protein homologs and higher than that for distant homologs and non-homologous proteins binding the common site. The current SELEX_DB release is available at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/systems/selex/.
 The GPCRDB is a molecular class-specific information system that collects, combines, validates and disseminates heterogeneous data on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The database stores data on sequences, ligand binding constants and mutations. The system also provides computationally derived data such as sequence alignments, homology models, and a series of query and visualization tools. The GPCRDB is updated automatically once every 4–5 months and is freely accessible at http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/ . 
 InterPro, an integrated documentation resource of protein families, domains and functional sites, was created in 1999 as a means of amalgamating the major protein signature databases into one comprehensive resource. PROSITE, Pfam, PRINTS, ProDom, SMART and TIGRFAMs have been manually integrated and curated and are available in InterPro for text- and sequence-based searching. The results are provided in a single format that rationalises the results that would be obtained by searching the member databases individually. The latest release of InterPro contains 5629 entries describing 4280 families, 1239 domains, 95 repeats and 15 post-translational modifications. Currently, the combined signatures in InterPro cover more than 74% of all proteins in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL, an increase of nearly 15% since the inception of InterPro. New features of the database include improved searching capabilities and enhanced graphical user interfaces for visualisation of the data. The database is available via a webserver ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro ) and anonymous FTP ( ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/interpro ). 
 The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology has become increasingly popular for nucleic acids detection and/or quantification. As primer/probe design and experimental evaluation is time-consuming, we developed a public database application for the storage and retrieval of validated real-time PCR primer and probe sequence records. The integrity and accuracy of the data are maintained by linking to and querying other reference databases. RTPrimerDB provides free public access through the Web to perform queries and submit user based information. Primer/probe records can be searched for by official gene symbol, nucleotide sequence, type of application, detection chemistry, LocusLink or Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) identifier, and submitter's name. Each record is directly linked to LocusLink, dbSNP and/or PubMed to retrieve additional information on the gene/SNP for which the primers/probes are designed. Currently, the database contains primer/probe records for human, mouse, rat, fruit fly and zebrafish, and all current detection chemistries such as intercalating dyes (SYBR Green I), hydrolysis probes (Taqman), adjacent hybridizations probes and molecular beacons. Real-time PCR primer/probe records are available at http://www.realtimeprimerdatabase.ht.st.
 Sequence conservation in non-coding, upstream regions of orthologous genes from man and mouse is likely to reflect common regulatory DNA sites. Motivated by this assumption we have delineated a catalogue of conserved non-coding sequence blocks and provide the CORG—‘COmparative Regulatory Genomics’—database. The data were computed based on statistically significant local suboptimal alignments of 15 kb regions upstream of the translation start sites of, currently, 10 793 pairs of orthologous genes. The resulting conserved non-coding blocks were annotated with EST matches for easier detection of non-coding mRNA and with hits to known transcription factor binding sites. CORG data are accessible from the ENSEMBL web site via a DAS service as well as a specially developed web service ( http://corg.molgen.mpg.de ) for query and interactive visualization of the conserved blocks and their annotation. 
 The PANTHER database was designed for high-throughput analysis of protein sequences. One of the key features is a simplified ontology of protein function, which allows browsing of the database by biological functions. Biologist curators have associated the ontology terms with groups of protein sequences rather than individual sequences. Statistical models (Hidden Markov Models, or HMMs) are built from each of these groups. The advantage of this approach is that new sequences can be automatically classified as they become available. To ensure accurate functional classification, HMMs are constructed not only for families, but also for functionally distinct subfamilies. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, including curator-assigned information, are available for each family. The current version of the PANTHER database includes training sequences from all organisms in the GenBank non-redundant protein database, and the HMMs have been used to classify gene products across the entire genomes of human, and Drosophila melanogaster . PANTHER is publicly available on the web at http://panther.celera.com . 
 Recent enhancements and current research in the GeneCards (GC) ( http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards/ ) project are described, including the addition of gene expression profiles and integrated gene locations. Also highlighted are the contributions of specialized associated human gene-centric databases developed at the Weizmann Institute. These include the Unified Database (UDB) ( http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/udb ) for human genome mapping, the human Chromosome 21 database at the Weizmann Insti-tute (CroW 21) ( http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/crow21 ), and the Human Olfactory Receptor Data Explora-torium (HORDE) ( http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/HORDE ). The synergistic relationships amongst these efforts have positively impacted the quality, quantity and usefulness of the GeneCards gene compendium. 
 Cytosine methylation is a characteristic property of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. In the latter, it is indispensable for a healthy development of the organism and uncontrolled changes in the distribution of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) have been linked to severe disorders, in particular cancer. The growing scientific interest in DNA methylation has led to a considerable amount of data about this epigenetic phenomenon. In order to make these data readily available, we have established a dedicated database. The DNA Methylation database (MethDB) is currently the only public database for DNA methylation ( http://www.methdb.net ). This constantly growing database has become a key resource in the field of DNA methylation research. The database contains currently methylation patterns, profiles and total methylation content data for 46 species, 160 tissues and 72 phenotypes coming from a total of 6667 experiments (as of September 4, 2002). About 14% of the data have not been published elsewhere. These data can be conveniently searched and represented in different ways. Recently, we have included an on-line submission tool that permits the scientific public to directly enter new data into MethDB. 
 The international ImMunoGeneTics database ® (IMGT) ( http://imgt.cines.fr ), is a high quality integrated information system specializing in Immunoglobulins (IG), T cell Receptors (TR) and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) of human and other vertebrates, created in 1989, by the Laboratoire d'ImmunoGénétique Moléculaire (LIGM), at the Université Montpellier II, CNRS, Montpellier, France. IMGT provides a common access to standardized data which include nucleotide and protein sequences, oligonucleotide primers, gene maps, genetic polymorphisms, specificities, 2D and 3D structures. IMGT includes three sequence databases (IMGT/LIGM-DB, IMGT/MHC-DB, IMGT/PRIMER-DB), one genome database (IMGT/GENE-DB) with different interfaces (IMGT/GeneSearch, IMGT/GeneView, IMGT/LocusView), one 3D structure database (IMGT/3Dstructure-DB), Web resources comprising 8000 HTML pages (‘IMGT Marie-Paule page’) and interactive tools for sequence analysis (IMGT/V-QUEST, IMGT/JunctionAnalysis, IMGT/Allele-Align, IMGT/PhyloGene). IMGT data are expertly annotated according to the rules of the IMGT Scientific chart, based on IMGT-ONTOLOGY. IMGT tools are particularly useful for the analysis of the IG and TR repertoires in physiological normal and pathological situations. IMGT has important applications in medical research (autoimmune diseases, AIDS, leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas), biotechnology related to antibody engineering (phage displays, combinatorial libraries) and thera-peutic approaches (graft, immunotherapy). IMGT is freely available at http://imgt.cines.fr . 
 In order to identify the genes and gene functions that underlie key aspects of legume biology, researchers have selected the cool season legume Medicago truncatula (Mt) as a model system for legume research. A set of >170 000 Mt ESTs has been assembled based on in-depth sampling from various developmental stages and pathogen-challenged tissues. MtDB is a relational database that integrates Mt transcriptome data and provides a wide range of user-defined data mining options. The database is interrogated through a series of interfaces with 58 options grouped into two filters. In addition, the user can select and compare unigene sets generated by different assemblers: Phrap, Cap3 and Cap4. Sequence identifiers from all public Mt sites (e.g. IDs from GenBank, CCGB, TIGR, NCGR, INRA) are fully cross-referenced to facilitate comparisons between different sites, and hypertext links to the appropriate database records are provided for all queries' results. MtDB's goal is to provide researchers with the means to quickly and independently identify sequences that match specific research interests based on user-defined criteria. The underlying database and query software have been designed for ease of updates and portability to other model organisms. Public access to the database is at http://www.medicago.org/MtDB . 
 The Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) is a web based community resource that serves as a centralized location for the curation and integration of zebrafish genetic, genomic and developmental data. ZFIN is publicly accessible at http://zfin.org . ZFIN provides an integrated representation of mutants, genes, genetic markers, mapping panels, publications and community contact data. Recent enhancements to ZFIN include: (i) an anatomical dictionary that provides a controlled vocabulary of anatomical terms, grouped by developmental stages, that may be used to annotate and query gene expression data; (ii) gene expression data; (iii) expanded support for genome sequence; (iv) gene annotation using the standardized vocabulary of Gene Ontology (GO) terms that can be used to elucidate relationships between gene products in zebrafish and other organisms; and (v) collaborations with other databases (NCBI, Sanger Institute and SWISS-PROT) to provide standardization and interconnections based on shared curation. 
 The IMGT/HLA database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/hla ) has provided a centralized repository for the sequences of the alleles named by the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System for the past four years. Since its initial release the database has grown and is the primary source of information for the study of sequences of the human major histocompatibilty complex. The initial release of the database contained a limited number of tools. As a result of feedback from our users and developments in HLA we have been able to provide new tools and facilities. The HLA sequences have also been extended to include intron sequences and the 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions in the alignments and also the inclusion of new genes such as MICA. The IMGT/MHC database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/mhc ) was released in March 2002 to provide a similar resource for other species. The first release of IMGT/MHC contains the sequences of non-human primates (apes, new and old world monkeys), canines and feline sequences. Further species will be added shortly and the database aims to become the primary source of MHC data for non-human sequences. 
 As the amount of biological data grows, so does the need for biologists to store and access this information in central repositories in a free and unambiguous manner. The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) hosts six core databases, which store information on DNA sequences (EMBL-Bank), protein sequences (SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL), protein structure (MSD), whole genomes (Ensembl) and gene expression (ArrayExpress). But just as a cell would be useless if it couldn't transcribe DNA or translate RNA, our resources would be compromised if each existed in isolation. We have therefore developed a range of tools that not only facilitate the deposition and retrieval of biological information, but also allow users to carry out searches that reflect the interconnectedness of biological information. The EBI's databases and tools are all available on our website at www.ebi.ac.uk . 
 TRANSPATH ® is a database system about gene regulatory networks that combines encyclopedic information on signal transduction with tools for visualization and analysis. The integration with TRANSFAC ® , a database about transcription factors and their DNA binding sites, provides the possibility to obtain complete signaling pathways from ligand to target genes and their products, which may themselves be involved in regulatory action. As of July 2002, the TRANSPATH Professional release 3.2 contains about 9800 molecules, >1800 genes and >11 400 reactions collected from ∼5000 references. With the ArrayAnalyzer™, an integrated tool has been developed for evaluation of microarray data. It uses the TRANSPATH data set to identify key regulators in pathways connected with up- or down-regulated genes of the respective array. The key molecules and their surrounding networks can be viewed with the PathwayBuilder™, a tool that offers four different modes of visualization. More information on TRANSPATH is available at http://www.biobase.de/pages/products/databases.html . 
 Mitochondria are organelles present in the cytoplasm of most eukaryotic cells; although they have their own DNA, the majority of the proteins necessary for a functional mitochondrion are coded by the nuclear DNA and only after transcription and translation they are imported in the mitochondrion as proteins. The primary role of the mitochondrion is electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Although it has been studied for a long time, the interest of researchers in mitochondria is still alive thanks to the discovery of mitochondrial role in apoptosis, aging and cancer. Aim of the MitoDrome database is to annotate the Drosophila melanogaster nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial proteins in order to contribute to the functional characterization of nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial proteins and to knowledge of gene diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunctions. Indeed D. melanogaster is one of the most studied organisms and a model for the Human genome. Data are derived from the comparison of Human mitochondrial proteins versus the Drosophila genome, ESTs and cDNA sequence data available in the FlyBase database. Links from the MitoDrome entries to the related homologous entries available in MitoNuC will be soon imple-mented. The MitoDrome database is available at http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/BIG/MitoDrome . Data are organised in a flat-file format and can be retrieved using the SRS system. 
 We have established the INFEVERS — INternet periodic FEVERS — website (which is freely accessible at http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/infevers/ ). Our objectives were to develop a specialist site to gather updated information on mutations responsible for hereditary inflammatory disorders: i.e. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), TRAPS (TNF Receptor 1A Associated Syndrome), HIDS (HyperIgD Syndrome), MWS (Muckle-Wells Syndrome)/FCU (Familial Cold Urticaria)/CINCA (Chronic Infantile Neurological Cutaneous and Articular Syndrome). Contributors submit their novel mutations through a 3 step form. Depending on the disease concerned, a member of the editorial board is automatically solicited to overview and validate new submissions, via a special secured web interface. If accepted, the new mutation is available on the INFEVERS web site and the discoverer, who is informed by email, is credited by having his/her name and date of the discovery on the site. The INFEVERS gateway provides researchers and clinicians with a common access location for information on similar diseases, allowing a rapid overview of the corresponding genetic defects at a glance. Furthermore, it is interactive and extendable according to the latest genes discovered. 
 The PRINTS database houses a collection of protein fingerprints. These may be used to assign uncharacterised sequences to known families and hence to infer tentative functions. The September 2002 release (version 36.0) includes 1800 fingerprints, encoding ∼11 000 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides and so on. In addition to its continued steady growth, we report here the development of an automatic supplement, prePRINTS, designed to increase the coverage of the resource and reduce some of the manual burdens inherent in its maintenance. The databases are accessible for interrogation and searching at http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/dbbrowser/PRINTS/ . 
 Understanding of cellular processes and underlying molecular events requires knowledge about different aspects of molecular interactions, networks of molecules and pathways in addition to the sequence, structure and function of individual molecules involved. Databases of interacting molecules, pathways and related chemical reaction equations have been developed. The kinetic data for these interactions, which is important for mechanistic investigation, quantitative study and simulation of cellular processes and events, is not provided in the existing databases. We introduce a new database of Kinetic Data of Bio-molecular Interactions (KDBI) aimed at providing experimentally determined kinetic data of protein–protein, protein-RNA, protein-DNA, protein-ligand, RNA-ligand, DNA-ligand binding or reaction events described in the literature. KDBI contains information about binding or reaction event, participating molecules (name, synonyms, molecular formula, classification, SWISS-PROT AC or CAS number), binding or reaction equation, kinetic data and related references. The kinetic data is in terms of one or a combination of the following quantities as given in the literature of a particular event: association/dissociation or on/off rate constant, first/second/third/… order rate constant, equilibrium rate constant, catalytic rate constant, equilibrium association/dissociation constant, inhibition constant and binding affinity constant. Each entry can be retrieved through protein or nucleic acid or ligand name, SWISS-PROT AC number, ligand CAS number and full-text search of a binding or reaction event. KDBI currently contains 8273 entries of biomolecular binding or reaction events involving 1380 proteins, 143 nucleic acids and 1395 small molecules. Hyperlinks are provided for accessing references in Medline and available 3D structures in PDB and NDB. This database can be accessed at http://xin.cz3.nus.edu.sg/group/kdbi/kdbi.asp . 
 The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ, http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp ) has collected and released more entries and bases than last year. This is mainly due to large-scale submissions from Japanese sequencing teams on mouse, rice, chimpanzee, nematoda and other organisms. The contributions of DDBJ over the past year are 17.3% (entries) and 10.3% (bases) of the combined outputs of the International Nucleotide Sequence Databases (INSD). Our complete genome sequence database, Genome Information Broker (GIB), has been improved by incorporating XML. It is now possible to perform a more sophisticated database search against the new GIB than the ordinary BLAST or FASTA search. 
 The NRMD is a database for nuclear receptor mutation information. It includes mutation information from SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL, several web-based mutation data resources, and data extracted from the literature in a fully automatic manner. Because it is also possible to add mutations manually, a hundred mutations were added for completeness. At present, the NRMD contains information about 893 mutations in 54 nuclear receptors. A common numbering scheme for all nuclear receptors eases the use of the information for many kinds of studies. The NRMD is freely available to academia and industry as a stand-alone version at: www.receptors.org/NR/ . 
 The Complete Arabidopsis Transcriptome Micro Array (CATMA) database contains gene sequence tag (GST) and gene model sequences for over 70% of the predicted genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome as well as primer sequences for GST amplification and a wide range of supplementary information. All CATMA GST sequences are specific to the gene for which they were designed, and all gene models were predicted from a complete reannotation of the genome using uniform parameters. The database is searchable by sequence name, sequence homology or direct SQL query, and is available through the CATMA website at http://www.catma.org/ . 
 We describe here the establishment of an online database containing a large number of sequences and related data on viroids, viroid-like RNAs and human hepatitis delta virus (vHDV) in a customizable and user-friendly format. This database is available on the World Wide Web at http://penelope.med.usherb.ca/subviral . 
 The Homeodomain Resource is a searchable, curated collection of information for the homeodomain protein family. The resource is organized in a compact form and provides user-friendly interfaces for both querying the component databases and assembling customized datasets. The current release (version 5.0, October 2002) contains 1056 full-length homeodomain-containing sequences, 37 experimentally-derived structures, 81 homeodomain interactions, 84 homeodomain DNA-binding sites and 114 homeodomain proteins implicated in human genetic disorders. A new feature of this new release is the inclusion of experimentally-derived protein–protein interaction data for homeodomain family members. All entries are cross-linked for easy retrieval of the original records from source databases. The Homeodomain Resource is freely available through the World Wide Web at http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/homeodomain/ . 
 Conformation Angles DataBase (CADB) provides an online resource to access data on conformation angles (both main-chain and side-chain) of protein structures in two data sets corresponding to 25% and 90% sequence identity between any two proteins, available in the Protein Data Bank. In addition, the database contains the necessary crystallographic parameters. The package has several flexible options and display facilities to visualize the main-chain and side-chain conformation angles for a particular amino acid residue. The package can also be used to study the interrelationship between the main-chain and side-chain conformation angles. A web based JAVA graphics interface has been deployed to display the user interested information on the client machine. The database is being updated at regular intervals and can be accessed over the World Wide Web interface at the following URL:  http://144.16.71.148/cadb/ . 
 WorfDB (Worm ORFeome DataBase; http://worfdb.dfci.harvard.edu ) was created to integrate and disseminate the data from the cloning of complete set of ∼19 000 predicted protein-encoding Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of Caenorhabditis elegans (also referred to as the ‘worm ORFeome’). WorfDB serves as a central data repository enabling the scientific community to search for availability and quality of cloned ORFs. So far, ORF sequence tags (OSTs) obtained for all individual clones have allowed exon structure corrections for ∼3400 ORFs originally predicted by the C. elegans sequencing consortium. In addition, we now have OSTs for ∼4300 predicted genes for which no ESTs were available. The database contains this OST information along with data pertinent to the cloning process. WorfDB could serve as a model database for other metazoan ORFeome cloning projects. 
 The second release of Thermodynamic Database for Nucleic Acids, NTDB 2.0, includes more than 4600 entries (250% increase over release 1.0). It contains sequence types and details of several thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy, Δ H ; entropy, Δ S ; Gibbs free energy, Δ G ; melting temperature,  T m ), experimental models and methods for extracting thermodynamic parameters, buffer conditions as well as all relevant literature information. In addition, the database statistics and references related to NTDB are included. Information on normal and modified nucleobases and nucleosides are collected in a new section ‘Nucleoside’ whereby data collected thus far will be release in NTDB 2.0. The NTDB is freely available at http://ntdb.chem.cuhk.edu.hk . 
 The Gene3D database ( http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath_new/Gene3D/ ) provides structural assignments for genes within complete genomes. These are available via the internet from either the World Wide Web or FTP. Assignments are made using PSI-BLAST and subsequently processed using the DRange protocol. The DRange protocol is an empirically benchmarked method for assessing the validity of structural assignments made using sequence searching methods where appropriate assignment statistics are collected and made available. Gene3D links assignments to their appropriate entries in relevent structural and classification resources (PDBsum, CATH database and the Dictionary of Homologous Superfamilies). Release 2.0 of Gene3D includes 62 genomes, 2 eukaryotes, 10 archaea and 40 bacteria. Currently, structural assignments can be made for between 30 and 40 percent of any given genome. In any genome, around half of those genes assigned a structural domain are assigned a single domain and the other half of the genes are assigned multiple structural domains. Gene3D is linked to the CATH database and is updated with each new update of CATH. 
 Rfam is a collection of multiple sequence alignments and covariance models representing non-coding RNA families. Rfam is available on the web in the UK at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/ and in the US at http://rfam.wustl.edu/ . These websites allow the user to search a query sequence against a library of covariance models, and view multiple sequence alignments and family annotation. The database can also be downloaded in flatfile form and searched locally using the INFERNAL package ( http://infernal.wustl.edu/ ). The first release of Rfam (1.0) contains 25 families, which annotate over 50 000 non-coding RNA genes in the taxonomic divisions of the EMBL nucleotide database. 
 SDAP (Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins) is a web server that provides rapid, cross-referenced access to the sequences, structures and IgE epitopes of allergenic proteins. The SDAP core is a series of CGI scripts that process the user queries, interrogate the database, perform various computations related to protein allergenic determinants and prepare the output HTML pages. The database component of SDAP contains information about the allergen name, source, sequence, structure, IgE epitopes and literature references and easy links to the major protein (PDB, SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL, PIR-ALN, NCBI Taxonomy Browser) and literature (PubMed, MEDLINE) on-line servers. The computational component in SDAP uses an original algorithm based on conserved properties of amino acid side chains to identify regions of known allergens similar to user-supplied peptides or selected from the SDAP database of IgE epitopes. This and other bioinformatics tools can be used to rapidly determine potential cross-reactivities between allergens and to screen novel proteins for the presence of IgE epitopes they may share with known allergens. SDAP is available via the World Wide Web at http://fermi.utmb.edu/SDAP/.
 PEP is a database of Predictions for Entire Proteomes. The database contains summaries of analyses of protein sequences from a range of organisms representing all three major kingdoms of life: eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea. All proteins publicly available for organisms were aligned against SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL and PDB. Additionally, the following annotations are provided: secondary structure, transmembrane helices, coiled coils, regions of low complexity, signal peptides, PROSITE motifs, nuclear localization signals and classes of cellular function. Proteins that contain long regions without regular secondary structure are also identified. We have produced a related database of structural domain-like fragments derived from PEP and clusters based on homology between all fragments. The PEP database, fragments and clusters are distributed freely as a set of flat files and have been integrated into SRS. The PEP group of databases can be accessed from: http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/pep . 
 The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) ( http://www.informatics.jax.org ) one component of a community database resource for the laboratory mouse, a key model organism for interpreting the human genome and for understanding human biology. MGD strives to provide an extensively integrated information resource with experimental details annotated from both literature and on-line genomic data sources. MGD curates and presents the consensus representation of genotype (sequence) to phenotype information including highly detailed information about genes and gene products. Primary foci of integration are through representations of relationships between genes, sequences and phenotypes. MGD collaborates with other bioinformatics groups to curate a definitive set of information about the laboratory mouse. Recent developments include a general implementation of database structures for controlled vocabularies and the integration of a phenotype classification system. 
 MBGD is a workbench system for comparative analysis of completely sequenced microbial genomes. The central function of MBGD is to create an orthologous gene classification table using precomputed all-against-all similarity relationships among genes in multiple genomes. In MBGD, an automated classification algorithm has been implemented so that users can create their own classification table by specifying a set of organisms and parameters. This feature is especially useful when the user's interest is focused on some taxonomically related organisms. The created classification table is stored into the database and can be explored combining with the data of individual genomes as well as similarity relationships among genomes. Using these data, users can carry out comparative analyses from various points of view, such as phylogenetic pattern analysis, gene order comparison and detailed gene structure comparison. MBGD is accessible at http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/ . 
 The ERGO TM ( http://ergo.integratedgenomics.com/ERGO/ ) genome analysis and discovery suite is an integration of biological data from genomics, biochemistry, high-throughput expression profiling, genetics and peer-reviewed journals to achieve a comprehensive analysis of genes and genomes. Far beyond any conventional systems that facilitate functional assignments, ERGO combines pattern-based analysis with comparative genomics by visualizing genes within the context of regulation, expression profiling, phylogenetic clusters, fusion events, networked cellular pathways and chromosomal neighborhoods of other functionally related genes. The result of this multifaceted approach is to provide an extensively curated database of the largest available integration of genomes, with a vast collection of reconstructed cellular pathways spanning all domains of life. Although access to ERGO is provided only under subscription, it is already widely used by the academic community. The current version of the system integrates 500 genomes from all domains of life in various levels of completion, 403 of which are available for subscription. 
 The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/ ) incorporates, organizes and distributes nucleotide sequences from all available public sources. The database is located and maintained at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) near Cambridge, UK. In an international collaboration with DDBJ (Japan) and GenBank (USA), data are exchanged amongst the collaborating databases on a daily basis to achieve optimal synchronization. Webin is the preferred web-based submission system for individual submitters, while automatic procedures allow incorporation of sequence data from large-scale genome sequencing centres and from the European Patent Office (EPO). Database releases are produced quarterly. Network services allow free access to the most up-to-date data collection via FTP, Email and World Wide Web interfaces. EBI's Sequence Retrieval System (SRS) integrates and links the main nucleotide and protein databases plus many other specialized molecular biology databases. For sequence similarity searching, a variety of tools (e.g. Fasta, BLAST) are available which allow external users to compare their own sequences against the latest data in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database and SWISS-PROT. All resources can be accessed via the EBI home page at http://www.ebi.ac.uk . 
Arabidopsis thaliana is the most widely-studied plant today. The concerted efforts of over 11 000 researchers and 4000 organizations around the world are generating a rich diversity and quantity of information and materials. This information is made available through a comprehensive on-line resource called the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) ( http://arabidopsis.org ), which is accessible via commonly used web browsers and can be searched and downloaded in a number of ways. In the last two years, efforts have been focused on increasing data content and diversity, functionally annotating genes and gene products with controlled vocabularies, and improving data retrieval, analysis and visualization tools. New information include sequence polymorphisms including alleles, germplasms and phenotypes, Gene Ontology annotations, gene families, protein information, metabolic pathways, gene expression data from microarray experiments and seed and DNA stocks. New data visualization and analysis tools include SeqViewer, which interactively displays the genome from the whole chromosome down to 10 kb of nucleotide sequence and AraCyc, a metabolic pathway database and map tool that allows overlaying expression data onto the pathway diagrams. Finally, we have recently incorporated seed and DNA stock information from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and implemented a shopping-cart style on-line ordering system. 
 GlycoSuiteDB is an annotated and curated relational database of glycan structures reported in the literature. It contains information on the glycan type, core type, linkages and anomeric configurations, mass, composition and the analytical methods used by the researchers to determine the glycan structure. Native and recombinant sources are detailed, including species, tissue and/or cell type, cell line, strain, life stage, disease, and if known the protein to which the glycan structures are attached. There are links to SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL and PubMed where applicable. Recent developments include the implementation of searching by 2D structure and substructure, disease and reference. The database is updated twice a year, and now contains over 7650 entries. Access to GlycoSuiteDB is available at http://www.glycosuite.com . 
 Génoplante is a partnership program between public French institutes (INRA, CIRAD, IRD and CNRS) and private companies (Biogemma, Bayer CropScience and Bioplante) that aims at developing genome analysis programs for crop species (corn, wheat, rapeseed, sunflower and pea) and model plants ( Arabidopsis and rice). The outputs of these programs form a wealth of information (genomic sequence, transcriptome, proteome, allelic variability, mapping and synteny, and mutation data) and tools (databases, interfaces, analysis software), that are being integrated and made public at the public bioinformatics resource centre of Génoplante: GénoPlante-Info (GPI). This continuous flood of data and tools is regularly updated and will grow continuously during the coming two years. Access to the GPI databases and tools is available at http://genoplante-info.infobiogen.fr/ . 
 ASAP (a systematic annotation package for community analysis of genomes) is a relational database and web interface developed to store, update and distribute genome sequence data and functional characterization ( https://asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/annotation/php/ASAP1.htm ). ASAP facilitates ongoing community annotation of genomes and tracking of information as genome projects move from preliminary data collection through post-sequencing functional analysis. The ASAP database includes multiple genome sequences at various stages of analysis, corresponding experimental data and access to collections of related genome resources. ASAP supports three levels of users: public viewers, annotators and curators. Public viewers can currently browse updated annotation information for Escherichia coli K-12 strain MG1655, genome-wide transcript profiles from more than 50 microarray experiments and an extensive collection of mutant strains and associated phenotypic data. Annotators worldwide are currently using ASAP to participate in a community annotation project for the Erwinia chrysanthemi strain 3937 genome. Curation of the E. chrysanthemi genome annotation as well as those of additional published enterobacterial genomes is underway and will be publicly accessible in the near future. 
 The database PRODORIC aims to systematically organize information on prokaryotic gene expression, and to integrate this information into regulatory networks. The present version focuses on pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa . PRODORIC links data on environmental stimuli with trans -acting transcription factors, cis -acting promoter elements and regulon definition. Interactive graphical representations of operon, gene and promoter structures including regulator-binding sites, transcriptional and translational start sites, supplemented with information on regulatory proteins are available at varying levels of detail. The data collection provided is based on exhaustive analyses of scientific literature and computational sequence prediction. Included within PRODORIC are tools to define and predict regulator binding sites. It is accessible at http://prodoric.tu-bs.de . 
 The Proteome Analysis database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteome/ ) has been developed by the Sequence Database Group at EBI utilizing existing resources and providing comparative analysis of the predicted protein coding sequences of the complete genomes of bacteria, archeae and eukaryotes. Three main projects are used, InterPro, CluSTr and GO Slim, to give an overview on families, domains, sites, and functions of the proteins from each of the complete genomes. Complete proteome analysis is available for a total of 89 proteome sets. A specifically designed application enables InterPro proteome comparisons for any one proteome against any other one or more of the proteomes in the database. 
 The Protein Information Resource (PIR) is an integrated public resource of protein informatics that supports genomic and proteomic research and scientific discovery. PIR maintains the Protein Sequence Database (PSD), an annotated protein database containing over 283 000 sequences covering the entire taxonomic range. Family classification is used for sensitive identification, consistent annotation, and detection of annotation errors. The superfamily curation defines signature domain architecture and categorizes memberships to improve automated classification. To increase the amount of experimental annotation, the PIR has developed a bibliography system for literature searching, mapping, and user submission, and has conducted retrospective attribution of citations for experimental features. PIR also maintains NREF, a non-redundant reference database, and iProClass, an integrated database of protein family, function, and structure information. PIR-NREF provides a timely and comprehensive collection of protein sequences, currently consisting of more than 1 000 000 entries from PIR-PSD, SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, RefSeq, GenPept, and PDB. The PIR web site ( http://pir.georgetown.edu ) connects data analysis tools to underlying databases for information retrieval and knowledge discovery, with functionalities for interactive queries, combinations of sequence and text searches, and sorting and visual exploration of search results. The FTP site provides free download for PSD and NREF biweekly releases and auxiliary databases and files. 
 The Medaka Expression Pattern Database (MEPD) stores and integrates information of gene expression during embryonic development of the small freshwater fish Medaka ( Oryzias latipes ). Expression patterns of genes identified by ESTs are documented by images and by descriptions through parameters such as staining intensity, category and comments and through a comprehensive, hierarchically organized dictionary of anatomical terms. Sequences of the ESTs are available and searchable through BLAST. ESTs in the database are clustered upon entry and have been blasted against public data-bases. The BLAST results are updated regularly, stored within the database and searchable. The MEPD is a project within the Medaka Genome Initiative (MGI) and entries will be interconnected to integrated genomic map databases. MEPD is accessible through the WWW at http://medaka.dsp.jst.go.jp/MEPD . 
 NLSdb is a database of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and of nuclear proteins. NLSs are short stretches of residues mediating transport of nuclear proteins into the nucleus. The database contains 114 experimentally determined NLSs that were obtained through an extensive literature search. Using ‘ in silico mutagenesis’ this set was extended to 308 experimental and potential NLSs. This final set matched over 43% of all known nuclear proteins and matches no currently known non-nuclear protein. NLSdb contains over 6000 predicted nuclear proteins and their targeting signals from the PDB and SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL databases. The database also contains over 12 500 predicted nuclear proteins from six entirely sequenced eukaryotic proteomes ( Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ). NLS motifs often co-localize with DNA-binding regions. This observation was used to also annotate over 1500 DNA-binding proteins. NLSdb can be accessed via the web site: http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/db/NLSdb/ . 
 We describe a Database of Simulated Molecular Motions (DSMM). This database is designed to serve as a single searchable site for locating movies and animations from simulations of biomolecules. DSMM is accessible via a webserver at: http://projects.villa-bosch.de/mcm/database/dsmm . 
 The Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND: http://bind.ca ) archives biomolecular interaction, complex and pathway information. A web-based system is available to query, view and submit records. BIND continues to grow with the addition of individual submissions as well as interaction data from the PDB and a number of large-scale interaction and complex mapping experiments using yeast two hybrid, mass spectrometry, genetic interactions and phage display. We have developed a new graphical analysis tool that provides users with a view of the domain composition of proteins in interaction and complex records to help relate functional domains to protein interactions. An interaction network clustering tool has also been developed to help focus on regions of interest. Continued input from users has helped further mature the BIND data specification, which now includes the ability to store detailed information about genetic interactions. The BIND data specification is available as ASN.1 and XML DTD. 
 The SWISS-PROT protein knowledgebase ( http://www.expasy.org/sprot/ and http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/ ) connects amino acid sequences with the current knowledge in the Life Sciences. Each protein entry provides an interdisciplinary overview of relevant information by bringing together experimental results, computed features and sometimes even contradictory conclusions. Detailed expertise that goes beyond the scope of SWISS-PROT is made available via direct links to specialised databases. SWISS-PROT provides annotated entries for all species, but concentrates on the annotation of entries from human (the HPI project) and other model organisms to ensure the presence of high quality annotation for representative members of all protein families. Part of the annotation can be transferred to other family members, as is already done for microbes by the High-quality Automated and Manual Annotation of microbial Proteomes (HAMAP) project. Protein families and groups of proteins are regularly reviewed to keep up with current scientific findings. Complementarily, TrEMBL strives to comprise all protein sequences that are not yet represented in SWISS-PROT, by incorporating a perpetually increasing level of mostly automated annotation. Researchers are welcome to contribute their knowledge to the scientific community by submitting relevant findings to SWISS-PROT at swiss-prot@expasy.org . 
 The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser Database is an up to date source for genome sequence data integrated with a large collection of related annotations. The database is optimized to support fast interactive performance with the web-based UCSC Genome Browser, a tool built on top of the database for rapid visualization and querying of the data at many levels. The annotations for a given genome are displayed in the browser as a series of tracks aligned with the genomic sequence. Sequence data and annotations may also be viewed in a text-based tabular format or downloaded as tab-delimited flat files. The Genome Browser Database, browsing tools and downloadable data files can all be found on the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics website ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ), which also contains links to documentation and related technical information. 
 The Ensembl ( http://www.ensembl.org/ ) database project provides a bioinformatics framework to organise biology around the sequences of large genomes. It is a comprehensive source of stable automatic annotation of human, mouse and other genome sequences, available as either an interactive web site or as flat files. Ensembl also integrates manually annotated gene structures from external sources where available. As well as being one of the leading sources of genome annotation, Ensembl is an open source software engineering project to develop a portable system able to handle very large genomes and associated requirements. These range from sequence analysis to data storage and visualisation and installations exist around the world in both companies and at academic sites. With both human and mouse genome sequences available and more vertebrate sequences to follow, many of the recent developments in Ensembl have focusing on developing automatic comparative genome analysis and visualisation. 
 TIGRFAMs is a collection of manually curated protein families consisting of hidden Markov models (HMMs), multiple sequence alignments, commentary, Gene Ontology (GO) assignments, literature references and pointers to related TIGRFAMs, Pfam and InterPro models. These models are designed to support both automated and manually curated annotation of genomes. TIGRFAMs contains models of full-length proteins and shorter regions at the levels of superfamilies, subfamilies and equivalogs, where equivalogs are sets of homologous proteins conserved with respect to function since their last common ancestor. The scope of each model is set by raising or lowering cutoff scores and choosing members of the seed alignment to group proteins sharing specific function (equivalog) or more general properties. The overall goal is to provide information with maximum utility for the annotation process. TIGRFAMs is thus complementary to Pfam, whose models typically achieve broad coverage across distant homologs but end at the boundaries of conserved structural domains. The database currently contains over 1600 protein families. TIGRFAMs is available for searching or downloading at www.tigr.org/TIGRFAMs . 
Zea mays DataBase (ZmDB) seeks to provide a comprehensive view of maize (corn) genetics by linking genomic sequence data with gene expression analysis and phenotypes of mutant plants. ZmDB originated in 1999 as the Web portal for a large project of maize gene discovery, sequencing and phenotypic analysis using a transposon tagging strategy and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing. Recently, ZmDB has broadened its scope to include all public maize ESTs, genome survey sequences (GSSs), and protein sequences. More than 170 000 ESTs are currently clustered into ∼20 000 contigs and about an equal number of apparent singlets. These clusters are continuously updated and annotated with respect to potential encoded protein products. More than 100 000 GSSs are similarly assembled and annotated by spliced alignment with EST and protein sequences. The ZmDB interface provides quick access to analytical tools for further sequence analysis. Every sequence record is linked to several display options and similarity search tools, including services for multiple sequence alignment, protein domain determination and spliced alignment. Furthermore, ZmDB provides web-based ordering of materials generated in the project, including ESTs, ordered collections of genomic sequences tagged with the RescueMu transposon and microarrays of amplified ESTs. ZmDB can be accessed at http://zmdb.iastate.edu/ . 
 FlyBase ( http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/ ) provides an integrated view of the fundamental genomic and genetic data on the major genetic model Drosophila melanogaster and related species. FlyBase has primary responsibility for the continual reannotation of the D. melanogaster genome. The ultimate goal of the reannotation effort is to decorate the euchromatic sequence of the genome with as much biological information as is available from the community and from the major genome project centers. A complete revision of the annotations of the now-finished euchromatic genomic sequence has been completed. There are many points of entry to the genome within FlyBase, most notably through maps, gene products and ontologies, structured phenotypic and gene expression data, and anatomy. 
 The analysis of gene regulatory networks has become one of the most challenging problems of the postgenomic era. Earlier we developed rSNP_Guide ( http://util.bionet.nsc.ru/databases/rsnp.html ), a computer system and database devoted to prediction of transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TF sites), which can be responsible for disease phenotypes. The prediction results were confirmed by 70 known relationships between TF sites and diseases, as well as by site-directed mutagenesis data. The rSNP_Guide is being investigated as a tool for TF site annotation. Previously analyzed and characterized cases of altered TF sites were used to annotate potential sites of the same type and at the same location in homologous genes. Based on 20 TF sites with known alterations in TF binding to DNA, we localized 245 potential TF sites in homologous genes. For these potential TF sites, rSNP_Guide estimates TF–DNA interaction according to three categories: ‘present’, ‘weak’, and ‘absent’. The significance of each assignment is statistically measured. 
 GenBank (R) is a comprehensive sequence database that contains publicly available DNA sequences for more than 119 000 different organisms, obtained primarily through the submission of sequence data from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects. Most submissions are made using the BankIt (web) or Sequin programs and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank staff upon receipt. Daily data exchange with the EMBL Data Library in the UK and the DNA Data Bank of Japan helps ensure worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through NCBI's retrieval system, Entrez, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. To access GenBank and its related retrieval and analysis services, go to the NCBI home page at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . 
 Ribosomal RNA-(rRNA)-targeted oligonucleotide probes are widely used for culture-independent identification of microorganisms in environmental and clinical samples. ProbeBase is a comprehensive database containing more than 700 published rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe sequences (status August 2002) with supporting bibliographic and biological annotation that can be accessed through the internet at http://www.probebase.net . Each oligonucleotide probe entry contains information on target organisms, target molecule (small- or large-subunit rRNA) and position, G+C content, predicted melting temperature, molecular weight, necessity of competitor probes, and the reference that originally described the oligonucleotide probe, including a link to the respective abstract at PubMed. In addition, probes successfully used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are highlighted and the recommended hybridization conditions are listed. ProbeBase also offers difference alignments for 16S rRNA-targeted probes by using the probe match tool of the ARB software and the latest small-subunit rRNA ARB database (release June 2002). The option to directly submit probe sequences to the probe match tool of the Ribosomal Database Project II (RDP-II) further allows one to extract supplementary information on probe specificities. The two main features of probeBase, ‘search probeBase’ and ‘find probe set’, help researchers to find suitable, published oligonucleotide probes for microorganisms of interest or for rRNA gene sequences submitted by the user. Furthermore, the ‘search target site’ option provides guidance for the development of new FISH probes. 
 The Database of Macromolecular Movements ( http://MolMovDB.org ) is a collection of data and software pertaining to flexibility in protein and RNA structures. The database is organized into two parts. Firstly, a collection of ‘morphs’ of solved structures representing different states of a molecule provides quantitative data for flexibility and a number of graphical representations. Secondly, a classification of known motions according to type of conformational change (e.g. ‘hinged domain’ or ‘allosteric’) incorporates textual annotation and information from the literature relating to the motion, linking together many of the morphs. A variety of subsets of the morphs are being developed for use in statistical analyses. In particular, for each subset it is possible to derive distributions of various motional quantities (e.g. maximum rotation) that can be used to place a specific motion in context as being typical or atypical for a given population. Over the past year, the database has been greatly expanded and enhanced to incorporate new structures and to improve the quality of data. The ‘morph server’, which enables users of the database to add new morphs either from their own research or the PDB, has also been enhanced to handle nucleic acid structures and multi-chain complexes. 
 PlantProm DB, a plant promoter database, is an annotated, non-redundant collection of proximal promoter sequences for RNA polymerase II with experimentally determined transcription start site(s), TSS, from various plant species. The first release (2002.01) of PlantProm DB contains 305 entries including 71, 220 and 14 promoters from monocot, dicot and other plants, respectively. It provides DNA sequence of the promoter regions (−200 : +51) with TSS on the fixed position +201, taxonomic/promoter type classification of promoters and Nucleotide Frequency Matrices (NFM) for promoter elements: TATA-box, CCAAT-box and TSS-motif (Inr). Analysis of TSS-motifs revealed that their composition is different in dicots and monocots, as well as for TATA and TATA-less promoters. The database serves as learning set in developing plant promoter prediction programs. One such program (TSSP) based on discriminant analysis has been created by Softberry Inc. and the application of a support ftp: vector machine approach for promoter identification is under development. PlantProm DB is available at http://mendel.cs.rhul.ac.uk/ and http://www.softberry.com/ . 
 Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTK) are transmembrane receptors specifically found in metazoans. They represent an excellent model for studying evolution of cellular processes in metazoans because they encompass large families of modular proteins and belong to a major family of contingency generating molecules in eukaryotic cells: the protein kinases. Because tyrosine kinases have been under close scrutiny for many years in various species, they are associated with a wealth of information, mainly in mammals. Presently, most categories of RTK were identified in mammals, but in a near future other model species will be sequenced, and will bring us RTKs from other metazoan clades. Thus, collecting RTK sequences would provide a good starting point as a new model for comparative and evolutionary studies applying to multigene families. In this context, we are developing the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase database (RTKdb), which is the only database on tyrosine kinase receptors presently available. In this database, protein sequences from eight model metazoan species are organized under the format previously used for the HOVERGEN, HOBACGEN and NUREBASE systems. RTKdb can be accessed through the PBIL (Pôle Bioinformatique Lyonnais) World Wide Web server at http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/RTKdb/ , or through the FamFetch graphical user interface available at the same address. 
 The GENETPIG database has been established for storing and disseminating the results of the European project: ‘GENETPIG: identification of genes controlling economic traits in pig’. The partners of this project have mapped about 630 porcine and human ESTs onto the pig genome. The database collects the mapping results and links them to other sources of mapping data; this includes pig maps as well as available comparative mapping information. Functional annotation of the mapped ESTs is also given when a significant similarity to cognate genes was established. The database is accessible for consultation via the Internet at http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/Genetpig/ . 
 The noncoding RNAs database is a collection of currently available sequence data on RNAs, which have no protein-coding capacity and have been implicated in regulation of cellular processes. The RNAs included in the database form very heterogenous group of molecules that act on different levels of information transmission in the cell. It includes RNAs acting on the level of chromatin structure, transcriptional and translational regulation of gene expression, modulation of protein function and regulation of subcellular distribution of RNAs and proteins. Those RNAs, with potential regulatory functions have been identified in prokaryotic, animal and plant cells. The database can be accessed at http://biobases.ibch.poznan.pl/ncRNA/ . 
 Organellar Genome Retrieval (OGRe) is a relational database of complete mitochondrial genome sequences for over 250 Metazoan species. OGRe provides a resource for the comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes at several levels. At the sequence level, OGRe allows the retrieval of any selected set of mitochondrial genes from any selected set of species. Species are classified using a taxonomic system that allows easy selection of related groups of species. Sequence alignments are also available for some species. At the level of individual nucleotides, the system contains information on base frequencies and codon usage frequencies that can be compared between organisms. At the level of whole genomes, OGRe provides several ways of visualizing information on gene order. Diagrams illustrating the genome arrangement can be generated for any selected set of species automatically from the information in the database. Searches can be done based on gene arrangement to find sets of species that have the same order as one another. Diagrams for pairwise comparison of species can be produced that show the positions of break-points in the gene order and use colour to highlight the sections of the genome that have moved. OGRe is available from http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/ogre . 
 SBASE ( http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/sbase ) is an on-line collection of protein domain sequences and related computational tools designed to facilitate detection of domain homologies based on simple database search. The 10th ‘jubilee release’ of the SBASE library of protein domain sequences contains 1 052 904 protein sequence segments annotated by structure, function, ligand-binding or cellular topology, clustered into over 6000 domain groups. Domain identification and functional prediction are based on a comparison of BLAST search outputs with a knowledge base of biologically significant similarities extracted from known domain groups. The knowledge base is generated automatically for each domain group from the comparison of within-group (‘self’) and out-of-group (‘non-self’) similarities. This is a memory-based approach wherein group-specific similarity functions are automatically learned from the database. 
 TMPDB is a database of experimentally-characterized transmembrane (TM) topologies. TMPDB release 6.2 contains a total of 302 TM protein sequences, in which 276 are α-helical sequences, 17 β-stranded, and 9 α-helical sequences with short pore-forming helices buried in the membrane. The TM topologies in TMPDB were determined experimentally by means of X-ray crystallography, NMR, gene fusion technique, substituted cysteine accessibility method, N -linked glycosylation experiment and other biochemical methods. TMPDB would be useful as a test and/or training dataset in improving the proposed TM topology prediction methods or developing novel methods with higher performance, and as a guide for both the bioinformaticians and biologists to better understand TM proteins. TMPDB and its subsets are freely available at the following web site: http://bioinfo.si.hirosaki-u.ac.jp/~TMPDB/ . 
 The TRANSFAC ® database on eukaryotic transcriptional regulation, comprising data on transcription factors, their target genes and regulatory binding sites, has been extended and further developed, both in number of entries and in the scope and structure of the collected data. Structured fields for expression patterns have been introduced for transcription factors from human and mouse, using the CYTOMER ® database on anatomical structures and developmental stages. The functionality of Match™, a tool for matrix-based search of transcription factor binding sites, has been enhanced. For instance, the program now comes along with a number of tissue-(or state-)specific profiles and new profiles can be created and modified with Match™ Profiler. The GENE table was extended and gained in importance, containing amongst others links to LocusLink, RefSeq and OMIM now. Further, (direct) links between factor and target gene on one hand and between gene and encoded factor on the other hand were introduced. The TRANSFAC ® public release is available at http://www.gene-regulation.com . For yeast an additional release including the latest data was made available separately as TRANSFAC ®Saccharomyces Module (TSM) at http://transfac.gbf.de . For CYTOMER ® free download versions are available at http://www.biobase.de:8080/index.html . 
 The CluSTr database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustr/ ) offers an automatic classification of SWISS-PROT+TrEMBL proteins into groups of related proteins. The clustering is based on analysis of all pair-wise sequence comparisons between proteins using the Smith–Waterman algorithm. The analysis, carried out on different levels of protein similarity, yields a hierarchical organization of clusters. Information about domain content of the clustered proteins is provided via the InterPro resource. The introduced InterPro ‘condensed graphical view’ simplifies the visual analysis of represented domain architectures. Integrated applications allow users to visualize and edit multiple alignments and build sequence divergence trees. Links to the relevant structural data in Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Homology derived Secondary Structure of Proteins (HSSP) are also provided. 
 The need for new tools for investigating biological systems on a large scale is becoming acute, particularly with respect to computationally intensive analyses such as comparisons of many three-dimensional protein structures. Structure superposition is a valuable approach for understanding evolutionary relationships and for the prediction of function. But while available tools are adequate for generating and viewing superpositions of single pairs of protein structures, these tools are generally too cumbersome and time-consuming for examining multiple superpositions. To address this need, we have created the Structure Superposition Database (SSD) for accessing, viewing and understanding large sets of structure superposition data. The initial implementation of the SSD contains the results of pairwise, all-by-all superpositions of a representative set of 115 (β/α) 8 barrel structures (TIM barrels). Future plans call for extending the database to include representative structure superpositions for many additional folds. The SSD can be browsed with a user interface module developed as an extension to Chimera, an extensible molecular modeling program. Features of the user interface module facilitate viewing multiple superpositions together. The SSD interface module can be downloaded from http://ssd.rbvi.ucsf.edu . 
 The CATH database of protein domain structures ( http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath_new ) currently contains 34 287 domain structures classified into 1383 superfamilies and 3285 sequence families. Each structural family is expanded with domain sequence relatives recruited from GenBank using a variety of efficient sequence search protocols and reliable thresholds. This extended resource, known as the CATH-protein family database (CATH-PFDB) contains a total of 310 000 domain sequences classified into 26 812 sequence families. New sequence search protocols have been designed, based on these intermediate sequence libraries, to allow more regular updating of the classification. 
 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) provides up-to-date information on inherited disorders and other familial traits in non-laboratory animals. It is freely available online at http://www.angis.org.au/omia . With a strong emphasis on comparative biology, OMIA is modelled on, and reciprocally hyperlinked with, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). It provides a comprehensive catalog of animal models of human inherited disorders, and also provides comprehensive access to information on potential human homologues of inherited disorders and traits in animals. Because its whole structure is based on comparative biology, it provides phenotypic information in a format that is complementary to all the relevant mapping and sequence databases now existing or being created across the animal kingdom. 
 The Adenylate Uridylate (AU)-Rich Element Database, ARED-mRNA version 2.0, contains information not present in the previous ARED. This includes additional data entries, new information and links to Unigene, LocusLink, RefSeq records and mouse homologue data. An ARE consensus sequence specific to the 3′UTR is the basis of ARED that demonstrated two important findings: (i) AREs are present in a large, previously unrecognized set of human mRNAs; and (ii) ARE-mRNAs encode proteins of diverse functions which are largely involved in early and transient biological responses. In this update, we have modified the strategy for identifying ARE-mRNA in order to systematically deal with inconsistencies of molecule type and mRNA region in GenBank records. Potential uses for the ARED in functional genomics are also given. The database is accessible via the web, http://rc.kfshrc.edu.sa/ared , with a new querying system that allows searching ARE-mRNAs by any public database identifier or name. The ARED website also contains relevant links to uses for the ARED. 
 GrainGenes, http://www.graingenes.org , is the international database for the wheat, barley, rye and oat genomes. For these species it is the primary repository for information about genetic maps, mapping probes and primers, genes, alleles and QTLs. Documentation includes such data as primer sequences, polymorphism descriptions, genotype and trait scoring data, experimental protocols used, and photographs of marker polymorphisms, disease symptoms and mutant phenotypes. These data, curated with the help of many members of the research community, are integrated with sequence and bibliographic records selected from external databases and results of BLAST searches of the ESTs. Records are linked to corresponding records in other important databases, e.g. Gramene's EST homologies to rice BAC/PACs, TIGR's Gene Indices and GenBank. In addition to this information within the GrainGenes database itself, the GrainGenes homepage at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov provides many other community resources including publications (the annual newsletters for wheat, barley and oat, monographs and articles), individual datasets (mapping and QTL studies, polymorphism surveys, variety performance evaluations), specialized databases (Triticeae repeat sequences, EST unigene sets) and pages to facilitate coordination of cooperative research efforts in specific areas such as SNP development, EST-SSRs and taxonomy. The goal is to serve as a central point for obtaining and contributing information about the genetics and biology of these cereal crops. 
 Maintained at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler, Texas, the tmRNA database (tmRDB) is accessible at the URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/tmRDB/tmRDB.html with mirror sites located at Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama ( http://www.ag.auburn.edu/mirror/tmRDB/ ) and the Bioinformatics Research Center, Aarhus, Denmark ( http://www.bioinf.au.dk/tmRDB/ ). The tmRDB collects and distributes information relevant to the study of tmRNA. In trans -translation, this molecule combines properties of tRNA and mRNA and binds several proteins to form the tmRNP. Related RNPs are likely to be functional in all bacteria. In this release of tmRDB, 186 new entries from 10 bacterial groups for a total of 274 tmRNA sequences have been added. Lists of the tmRNAs and the corresponding tmRNA-encoded tag-peptides are presented in alphabetical and phylogenetic order. The tmRNA sequences are aligned manually, assisted by computational tools, to determine base pairs supported by comparative sequence analysis. The tmRNA alignment, available in a variety of formats, provides the basis for the secondary and tertiary structure of each tmRNA molecule. Three-dimensional models of the tmRNAs and their associated proteins in PDB format give evidence for the recent progress that has been made in the understanding of tmRNP structure and function. 
 The Ribosomal Database Project-II (RDP-II) pro-vides data, tools and services related to ribosomal RNA sequences to the research community. Through its website ( http://rdp.cme.msu.edu ), RDP-II offers aligned and annotated rRNA sequence data, analysis services, and phylogenetic inferences (trees) derived from these data. RDP-II release 8.1 contains 16 277 prokaryotic, 5201 eukaryotic, and 1503 mitochondrial small subunit rRNA sequences in aligned and annotated format. The current public beta release of 9.0 debuts a new regularly updated alignment of over 50 000 annotated (eu)bacterial sequences. New analysis services include a sequence search and selection tool (Hierarchy Browser) and a phylogenetic tree building and visualization tool (Phylip Interface). A new interactive tutorial guides users through the basics of rRNA sequence analysis. Other services include probe checking, phylogenetic placement of user sequences, screening of users' sequences for chimeric rRNA sequences, automated alignment, production of similarity matrices, and services to plan and analyze terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP) experiments. The RDP-II email address for questions or comments is rdpstaff@msu.edu . 
 PlasmoDB ( http://PlasmoDB.org ) is the official database of the Plasmodium falciparum genome sequencing consortium. This resource incorporates the recently completed P. falciparum genome sequence and annotation, as well as draft sequence and annotation emerging from other Plasmodium sequencing projects. PlasmoDB currently houses information from five parasite species and provides tools for intra- and inter-species comparisons. Sequence information is integrated with other genomic-scale data emerging from the Plasmodium research community, including gene expression analysis from EST, SAGE and microarray projects and proteomics studies. The relational schema used to build PlasmoDB, GUS (Genomics Unified Schema) employs a highly structured format to accommodate the diverse data types generated by sequence and expression projects. A variety of tools allow researchers to formulate complex, biologically-based, queries of the database. A stand-alone version of the database is also available on CD-ROM ( P. falciparum GenePlot), facilitating access to the data in situations where internet access is difficult (e.g. by malaria researchers working in the field). The goal of PlasmoDB is to facilitate utilization of the vast quantities of genomic-scale data produced by the global malaria research community. The software used to develop PlasmoDB has been used to create a second Apicomplexan parasite genome database, ToxoDB ( http://ToxoDB.org ). 
 We present here the MetaFMF database (freely accessible at http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/metaFMF/index_us.html ) that attempts to gather and unify, in a common resource, data on phenotype–genotype correlation in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). A single accession form, including a large number of quality controls, has been implemented such that data, collected worldwide, are included in an homogeneous manner. The inclusion criterion has the objective to avoid interpretational bias: patients will be included only if they bear at least two mutations. The clinical form has been set up by an International editorial board (12 FMF expert centres), which guarantees the validity of the data. Data are anonymous and submitted by a secure interface, in which the researcher is logged in with a specific ID and password. A pilot study on 211 patients has shown the feasibility and relevance of this project. We anticipate that the use of MetaFMF will enable reliable assessment of phenotype–genotype correlations in FMF, and define a set of severe versus mild mutations/genotypes. It should also highlight reasons for previous inconsistencies in such correlations. 
 The Stanford Microarray Database (SMD; http://genome-www.stanford.edu/microarray/ ) serves as a microarray research database for Stanford investigators and their collaborators. In addition, SMD functions as a resource for the entire scientific community, by making freely available all of its source code and providing full public access to data published by SMD users, along with many tools to explore and analyze those data. SMD currently provides public access to data from 3500 microarrays, including data from 85 publications, and this total is increasing rapidly. In this article, we describe some of SMD's newer tools for accessing public data, assessing data quality and for data analysis. 
 The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD: http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/ ) has recently developed new resources to provide more complete information about proteins from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The PDB Homologs page provides structural information from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) about yeast proteins and/or their homologs. SGD has also created a resource that utilizes the eMOTIF database for motif information about a given protein. A third new resource is the Protein Information page, which contains protein physical and chemical properties, such as molecular weight and hydropathicity scores, predicted from the translated ORF sequence. 
 The goal of the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) project is to provide the single best non-redundant and comprehensive collection of naturally occurring biological molecules, representing the central dogma. Nucleotide and protein sequences are explicitly linked on a residue-by-residue basis in this collection. Ideally all molecule types will be available for each well-studied organism, but the initial database collection pragmatically includes only those molecules and organisms that are most readily identified. Thus different amounts of information are available for different organisms at any given time. Furthermore, for some organisms additional intermediate records are provided when the genome sequence is not yet finished. The collection is supplied by NCBI through three distinct pipelines in addition to collaborations with community groups. The collection is curated on an ongoing basis. Additional information about the NCBI RefSeq project is available at http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/RefSeq/ . 
 Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRES) are cis -acting RNA sequences able to mediate internal entry of the 40S ribosomal subunit on some eukaryotic and viral messenger RNAs upstream of a translation initiation codon. These sequences are very diverse and are present in a growing list of mRNAs. Novel IRES sequences continue to be added to public databases every year and the list of unknown IRESes is certainly still very large. The IRES database is a comprehensive WWW resource for internal ribosome entry sites and presents currently available general information as well as detailed data for each IRES. It is a searchable, periodically updated collection of IRES RNA sequences. Sequences are presented in FASTA form and hotlinked to NCBI GenBank files. Several subsets of data are classified according to the viral taxon (for viral IRESes), to the gene product function (for cellular IRESes), to the possible cellular regulation or to the trans -acting factor that mediates IRES function. This database is accessible at http://ifr31w3.toulouse.inserm.fr/IRESdatabase/ . 
 The Lipase Engineering Database (LED) ( http://www.led.uni-stuttgart.de ) integrates information on sequence, structure, and function of lipases, esterases, and related proteins. Sequence data on 806 protein entries are assigned to 38 homologous families, which are grouped into 16 superfamilies with no global sequence similarity between each other. For each family, multisequence alignments are provided with functionally relevant residues annotated. Pre-calculated phylogenetic trees allow navigation inside superfamilies. Experimental structures of 45 proteins are superposed and consistently annotated. The LED has been applied to systematically analyze sequence–structure–function relationships of this vast and diverse enzyme class. It is a useful tool to identify functionally relevant residues apart from the active site residues, and to design mutants with desired substrate specificity. 
 Active Sequences Collection (ASC) is a collection of amino acid sequences, with an unique feature: only short sequences are collected, with a demonstrated biological activity. The current version of ASC consists of three sections: DORRS, a collection of active RGD-containing peptides; TRANSIT, a collection of protein regions active as substrates of transglutaminase enzyme (TGase), and BAC, a collection of short peptides with demonstrated biological activity. Literature references for each entry are reported, as well as cross references to other databases, when available. The current version of ASC includes more than 800 different entries. The main scope of this collection is to offer a new tool to investigate the structural features of protein active sites, additionally to similarity searches against large protein databases or searching for known functional patterns. ASC database is available at the web address http://crisceb.unina2.it/ASC/ which also offers a dedicated query interface to compare user-defined protein sequences with the database, as well as an updating interface to allow contribution of new referenced active sequences. 
 The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB) at http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html and http://bio.lundberg.gu.se/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html assists in the better understanding of the structure and function of the signal recognition particle (SRP), a ribonucleoprotein complex that recognizes signal sequences as they emerge from the ribosome. SRPDB provides alphabetically and phylogenetically ordered lists of SRP RNA and SRP protein sequences. The SRP RNA alignment emphasizes base pairs supported by comparative sequence analysis to derive accurate SRP RNA secondary structures for each species. This release includes a total of 181 SRP RNA sequences, 7 protein SRP9, 11 SRP14, 31 SRP19, 113 SRP54 (Ffh), 9 SRP68 and 12 SRP72 sequences. There are 44 new sequences of the SRP receptor alpha subunit and its FtsY homolog (a total of 99 entries). Additional data are provided for polypeptides with established or potential roles in SRP-mediated protein targeting, such as the beta subunit of SRP receptor, Flhf, Hbsu and cpSRP43. Also available are motifs for the identification of new SRP RNA sequences, 2D representations, three-dimensional models in PDB format, and links to the high-resolution structures of several SRP components. New to this version of SRPDB is the introduction of a relational database system and a SRP RNA prediction server (SRP-Scan) which allows the identification of SRP RNAs within genome sequences and also generates secondary structure diagrams. 
 Elaboration of ALFRED ( http://alfred.med.yale.edu ) is being continued in two directions. One of which is developing tools for efficiently annotating the entries and checking the integrity of the data already in the database while the other is to increase the quantity and accessibility of data. Information contained in ALFRED such as, polymorphic sites, number of populations and frequency tables (one sample typed for one site) has significantly increased. 
 We present ParaDB ( http://abi.marseille.inserm.fr/paradb/ ), a new database for large-scale paralogy studies in vertebrate genomes. We intended to collect all information (sequence, mapping and phylogenetic data) needed to map and detect new paralogous regions, previously defined as Paralogons. The AceDB database software was used to generate graphical objects and to organize data. General data were automatically collated from public sources (Ensembl, GadFly and RefSeq). ParaDB provides access to data derived from whole genome sequences ( Homo sapiens , Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster ): cDNA and protein sequences, positional information, bibliographical links. In addition, we provide BLAST results for each protein sequence, InParanoid orthologs and ‘In-Paralogs’ data, previously established paralogy data, and, to compare vertebrates and Drosophila , orthology data. 
 The explosion in the number of functional genomic datasets generated with tools such as DNA microarrays has created a critical need for resources that facilitate the interpretation of large-scale biological data. SOURCE is a web-based database that brings together information from a broad range of resources, and provides it in manner particularly useful for genome-scale analyses. SOURCE's GeneReports include aliases, chromosomal location, functional descriptions, GeneOntology annotations, gene expression data, and links to external databases. We curate published microarray gene expression datasets and allow users to rapidly identify sets of co-regulated genes across a variety of tissues and a large number of conditions using a simple and intuitive interface. SOURCE provides content both in gene and cDNA clone-centric pages, and thus simplifies analysis of datasets generated using cDNA microarrays. SOURCE is continuously updated and contains the most recent and accurate information available for human, mouse, and rat genes. By allowing dynamic linking to individual gene or clone reports, SOURCE facilitates browsing of large genomic datasets. Finally, SOURCEs batch interface allows rapid extraction of data for thousands of genes or clones at once and thus facilitates statistical analyses such as assessing the enrichment of functional attributes within clusters of genes. SOURCE is available at http://source.stanford.edu . 
 The MICdb ( Mic rosatellites D ata b ase) ( http://www.cdfd.org.in/micas ) is a comprehensive relational database of non-redundant microsatellites extracted from fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes. The current version (1.0) of the database has been compiled from 83 genomes belonging to different phylogenetic groups. This database has been linked to MICAS, the web-based Mic rostatellite A nalysis S erver. MICAS provides a user-friendly front-end to systematically extract data on microsatellite tracts from genomes. The database contains the following information pertaining to the microsatellites: the regions (coding/non-coding, if coding, their GenBank annotations) containing microsatellite tracts; the frequencies of their occurrences, the size and the number of repeating motifs; and the sequences of the tracts. MICAS also provides an interface to Autoprimer, a primer design program to automatically design primers for selected microsatellite loci. 
 The Mitochondrial Protein Import Machinery of Plants database (MPIMP) is an Internet-accessible database containing detailed information on the protein import apparatus of plant mitochondria. The Arabidopsis genome was searched for com-ponents of the mitochondrial protein import apparatus using components from the well-characterized model system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Twenty six homologues of 34 components could be found, encompassing the essential components for the general and carrier import pathways. The database is available through the Internet at http://millar3.biochem.uwa.edu.au/~lister/index.html . 
 We introduce the PSSH (‘Protein Sequence-to-Structure Homologies’) database derived from HSSP2, an improved version of the HSSP (‘Homology-derived Secondary Structure of Proteins’) database [Dodge et al. (1998) Nucleic Acids Res. , 26, 313–315]. Whereas each HSSP entry lists all protein sequences related to a given 3D structure, PSSH is the ‘inverse’, with each entry listing all structures related to a given sequence. In addition, we introduce two other derived databases: HSSPchain, in which each entry lists all sequences related to a given PDB chain, and HSSPalign, in which each entry gives details of one sequence aligned onto one PDB chain. This re-organization makes it easier to navigate from sequence to structure, and to map sequence features onto 3D structures. Currently (September 2002), PSSH provides structural information for over 400 000 protein sequences, covering 48% of SWALL and 61% of SWISS-PROT sequences; HSSPchain provides sequence information for over 25 000 PDB chains, and HSSPalign gives over 14 million sequence-to-structure alignments. The databases can be accessed via SRS 3D, an extension to the SRS system, at http://srs3d.ebi.ac.uk/ . 
 The ProtoNet site provides an automatic hierarchical clustering of the SWISS-PROT protein database. The clustering is based on an all-against-all BLAST similarity search. The similarities' E -score is used to perform a continuous bottom-up clustering process by applying alternative rules for merging clusters. The outcome of this clustering process is a classification of the input proteins into a hierarchy of clusters of varying degrees of granularity. ProtoNet (version 1.3) is accessible in the form of an interactive web site at http://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il . ProtoNet provides navigation tools for monitoring the clustering process with a vertical and horizontal view. Each cluster at any level of the hierarchy is assigned with a statistical index, indicating the level of purity based on biological keywords such as those provided by SWISS-PROT and InterPro. ProtoNet can be used for function prediction, for defining superfamilies and subfamilies and for large-scale protein annotation purposes. 
 Advances in proteomics technology have enabled new proteins to be discovered at an unprecedented speed, and high throughput experimental methods have been developed to detect protein interactions and complexes en masse. Such bottom-up, data-driven approach has resulted in data that may be uninformative or potentially errorful, requiring further validation and annotation. The InterDom database focuses on providing supporting evidence for the detected protein interactions based on putative protein domain interactions. Using an integrative approach, InterDom derives potential domain interactions by combining data from multiple sources, ranging from domain fusions, protein interactions and complexes, to scientific literature. The InterDom database is available at http://InterDom.lit.org.sg . 
 The updated version of PLMItRNA reports information and multialignments on 609 genes and 34 tRNA molecules active in the mitochondria of Viridiplantae (27 Embryophyta and 10 Chlorophyta), and photosynthetic algae (one Cryptophyta, four Rhodophyta and two Stramenopiles). Colour-code based tables reporting the different genetic origin of identified genes allow hyper-textual link to single entries. Promoter sequences identified for tRNA genes in the mitochondrial genomes of Angiospermae are also reported. The PLMItRNA database is accessible at http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/PLMItRNA/ . 
 The RESID Database is a comprehensive collection of annotations and structures for protein pre-, co- and post-translational modifications including amino-terminal, carboxyl-terminal and peptide chain cross-link modifications. The RESID Database includes: systematic and alternate names, atomic formulas and masses, enzyme activities generating the modifications, keywords, literature citations, Gene Ontology cross-references, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and SWISS-PROT protein sequence database feature table annotations, structure diagrams and molecular models. This database is freely accessible on the Internet through the European Bioinformatics Institute at http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srs6bin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-page+LibInfo+-lib+RESID , through the National Cancer Institute — Frederick Advanced Biomedical Computing Center at http://www.ncifcrf.gov/RESID , or through the Protein Information Resource at http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/resid.html . 
 The Nuclear Protein Database (NPD) is a curated database that contains information on more than 1300 vertebrate proteins that are thought, or are known, to localise to the cell nucleus. Each entry is annotated with information on predicted protein size and isoelectric point, as well as any repeats, motifs or domains within the protein sequence. In addition, information on the sub-nuclear localisation of each protein is provided and the biological and molecular functions are described using Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The database is searchable by keyword, protein name, sub-nuclear compartment and protein domain/motif. Links to other databases are provided (e.g. Entrez, SWISS-PROT, OMIM, PubMed, PubMed Central). Thus, NPD provides a gateway through which the nuclear proteome may be explored. The database can be accessed at http://npd.hgu.mrc.ac.uk and is updated monthly. 
 Rice is not only a major food staple for the world's population but it also is a model species for a major group of flowering plants, the monocotyledonous plants. Draft genomic sequence of two subspecies of rice, Oryza sativa spp. japonica and indica ssp. are publicly available. To provide the community with a resource to data-mine the rice genome, we have constructed an annotation resource for rice ( http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1/ ). In this resource, we have annotated the rice genome for gene content, identified motifs/domains within the predicted genes, constructed a rice repeat database, identified related sequences in other plant species, and identified syntenic sequences between rice and maize. All of the data is available through web-based interfaces, FTP downloads, and a Distributed Annotation System. 
 PDB-REPRDB is a database of representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Started at the Real World Computing Partnership (RWCP) in August 1997, it developed to the present system of PDB-REPRDB. In April 2001, the system was moved to the Computational Biology Research Center (CBRC), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) ( http://www.cbrc.jp/ ); it is available at http://www.cbrc.jp/pdbreprdb/ . The current database includes 33 368 protein chains from 16 682 PDB entries (1 September, 2002), from which are excluded (a) DNA and RNA data, (b) theoretically modeled data, (c) short chains (1<40 residues), or (d) data with non-standard amino acid residues at all residues. 
 Two million plant ESTs, from 20 different plant species, and totalling more than one 1000 Mbp of DNA sequence, represents a formidable transcriptomic resource. Sputnik uses the potential of this sequence resource to fill some of the information gap in the un-sequenced plant genomes and to serve as the foundation for in silicio comparative plant genomics. The complexity of the individual EST collections has been reduced using optimised EST clustering techniques. Annotation of cluster sequences is performed by exploiting and transferring information from the comprehensive knowledgebase already produced for the completed model plant genome ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) and by performing additional state of-the-art sequence analyses relevant to today's plant biologist. Functional predictions, comparative analyses and associative annotations for 500 000 plant EST derived peptides make Sputnik ( http://mips.gsf.de/proj/sputnik/ ) a valid platform for contemporary plant genomics. 
 The ‘Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology’ ( http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/chromcancer) contains concise and updated cards on genes involved in cancer, cytogenetics and clinical entities in oncology, and cancer-prone diseases, a portal towards genetics/cancer, and teaching materials in genetics. This database is made for and by researchers and clinicians, who are encouraged to contribute. The Atlas is part of the genome project and it participates in research on cancer epidemiology. 
 The database of Phylogeny and ALIgnment of homologous protein structures (PALI) contains three-dimensional (3-D) structure-dependent sequence alignments as well as structure-based phylogenetic trees of protein domains in various families. The latest updated version (Release 2.1) comprises of 844 families of homologous proteins involving 3863 protein domain structures with each of these families having at least two members. Each member in a family has been structurally aligned with every other member in the same family using two proteins at a time. In addition, an alignment of multiple structures has also been performed using all the members in a family. Every family with at least three members is associated with two dendrograms, one based on a structural dissimilarity metric and the other based on similarity of topologically equivalenced residues for every pairwise alignment. Apart from these multi-member families, there are 817 single member families in the updated version of PALI. A new feature in the current release of PALI is the integration, with 3-D structural families, of sequences of homologues from the sequence databases. Alignments between homologous proteins of known 3-D structure and those without an experimentally derived structure are also provided for every family in the enhanced version of PALI. The database with several web interfaced utilities can be accessed at: http://pauling.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/~pali . 
 Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events. The database STRING is a precomputed global resource for the exploration and analysis of these associations. Since the three types of evidence differ conceptually, and the number of predicted interactions is very large, it is essential to be able to assess and compare the significance of individual predictions. Thus, STRING contains a unique scoring-framework based on benchmarks of the different types of associations against a common reference set, integrated in a single confidence score per prediction. The graphical representation of the network of inferred, weighted protein interactions provides a high-level view of functional linkage, facilitating the analysis of modularity in biological processes. STRING is updated continuously, and currently contains 261 033 orthologs in 89 fully sequenced genomes. The database predicts functional interactions at an expected level of accuracy of at least 80% for more than half of the genes; it is online at http://www.bork.embl-heidelberg.de/STRING/ . 
 The Conserved Domain Database (CDD) is now indexed as a separate database within the Entrez system and linked to other Entrez databases such as MEDLINE®. This allows users to search for domain types by name, for example, or to view the domain architecture of any protein in Entrez's sequence database. CDD can be accessed on the WorldWideWeb at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=cdd . Users may also employ the CD-Search service to identify conserved domains in new sequences, at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi . CD-Search results, and pre-computed links from Entrez's protein database, are calculated using the RPS-BLAST algorithm and Position Specific Score Matrices (PSSMs) derived from CDD alignments. CD-Searches are also run by default for protein–protein queries submitted to BLAST® at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST . 
 The Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.pdb.org/ ) continues to be actively involved in various aspects of the informatics of structural genomics projects—developing and maintaining the Target Registration Database (TargetDB), organizing data dictionaries that will define the specification for the exchange and deposition of data with the structural genomics centers and creating software tools to capture data from standard structure determination applications. 
 ArrayExpress is a new public database of microarray gene expression data at the EBI, which is a generic gene expression database designed to hold data from all microarray platforms. ArrayExpress uses the annotation standard Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) and the associated XML data exchange format Microarray Gene Expression Markup Language (MAGE-ML) and it is designed to store well annotated data in a structured way. The ArrayExpress infrastructure consists of the database itself, data submissions in MAGE-ML format or via an online submission tool MIAMExpress, online database query interface, and the Expression Profiler online analysis tool. ArrayExpress accepts three types of submission, arrays, experiments and protocols, each of these is assigned an accession number. Help on data submission and annotation is provided by the curation team. The database can be queried on parameters such as author, laboratory, organism, experiment or array types. With an increasing number of organisations adopting MAGE-ML standard, the volume of submissions to ArrayExpress is increasing rapidly. The database can be accessed at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress . 
 Recently, genomics analyses have demonstrated that alternative splicing is widespread in mammalian genomes (30–60% of genes reported to have multiple isoforms), and may be one of their most important mechanisms of functional regulation. However, by comparison with other genomics data such as genome annotation, SNPs, or gene expression, there exists relatively little database infrastructure for the study of alternative splicing. We have constructed an online database ASAP (the Alternative Splicing Annotation Project) for biologists to access and mine the enormous wealth of alternative splicing information coming from genomics and proteomics. ASAP is based on genome-wide analyses of alternative splicing in human (30 793 alternative splice relationships found) from detailed alignment of expressed sequences onto the genomic sequence. ASAP provides precise gene exon–intron structure, alternative splicing, tissue specificity of alternative splice forms, and protein isoform sequences resulting from alternative splicing. Moreover, it can help biologists design probe sequences for distinguishing specific mRNA isoforms. ASAP is intended to be a community resource for collaborative annotation of alternative splice forms, their regulation, and biological functions. The URL for ASAP is http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/ASAP . 
 The SNP Consortium website ( http://snp.cshl.org ) has undergone many changes since its initial conception three years ago. The database back end has been changed from the venerable ACeDB to the more scalable MySQL engine. Users can access the data via gene or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) keyword searches and browse or dump SNP data to textfiles. A graphical genome browsing interface shows SNPs mapped onto the genome assembly in the context of externally available gene predictions and other features. SNP allele frequency and genotype data are available via FTP-download and on individual SNP report web pages. SNP linkage maps are available for download and for browsing in a comparative map viewer. All software components of the data coordinating center (DCC) website ( http://snp.cshl.org ) are open source. 
 Enlarged FAMSBASE is a relational database of comparative protein structure models for the whole genome of 41 species, presented in the GTOP database. The models are calculated by Full Automatic Modeling System (FAMS). Enlarged FAMSBASE provides a wide range of query keys, such as name of ORF (open reading frame), ORF keywords, Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, PDB heterogen atoms and sequence similarity. Heterogen atoms in PDB include cofactors, ligands and other factors that interact with proteins, and are a good starting point for analyzing interactions between proteins and other molecules. The data may also work as a template for drug design. The present number of ORFs with protein 3D models in FAMSBASE is 183 805, and the database includes an average of three models for each ORF. FAMSBASE is available at http://famsbase.bio.nagoya-u.ac.jp/famsbase/ . 
 The PEDANT genome database ( http://pedant.gsf.de ) provides exhaustive automatic analysis of genomic sequences by a large variety of established bioinformatics tools through a comprehensive Web-based user interface. One hundred and seventy seven completely sequenced and unfinished genomes have been processed so far, including large eukaryotic genomes (mouse, human) published recently. In this contribution, we describe the current status of the PEDANT database and novel analytical features added to the PEDANT server in 2002. Those include: (i) integration with the BioRS™ data retrieval system which allows fast text queries, (ii) pre-computed sequence clusters in each complete genome, (iii) a comprehensive set of tools for genome comparison, including genome comparison tables and protein function prediction based on genomic context, and (iv) computation and visualization of protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks based on experimental data. The availability of functional and structural predictions for 650 000 genomic proteins in well organized form makes PEDANT a useful resource for both functional and structural genomics. 
 Analysis of intergenic sequences for purposes such as the investigation of transcriptional signals or the identification of small RNA genes is frequently complicated by traditional biological database structures. Genome data is commonly treated as chromosome-length sequence records, detailed by gene calls demarcating subsequences of the chromosomes. Given this model, the determination of non-called subsequences between any gene and its nearest neighbors requires an exhaustive search of all gene calls associated with the chromosome. Further compounding the issue, the location of intergenic regions for many called genes cannot be resolved unambiguously due to uncertainties in gene boundaries, as well as the presence of other conflicting gene calls. To address these difficulties we have constructed the PACRAT ( http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~pacrat/ ) database system. PACRAT preprocesses GenBank genome submissions, evaluates for every gene the character of its relationship to those genes nearest to it, and produces a relationally linked model of the gene ordering for the genome. Using this information, the interface allows the researcher to query gene data as well as intergenic sequence data based on a number of criteria. These include the ability to filter searches based on the status of start and stop positions, or upstream/downstream sequences as conflicting with called genes and automated extension of upstream or downstream searches to find probable operon promoters or terminators. The database is also indexed by KEGG classification, allowing, for example, functionally-related groups of high-quality promoter-containing regions to be easily retrieved as a group. 
 The i ProClass database provides comprehensive, value-added descriptions of proteins and serves as a framework for data integration in a distributed networking environment. The protein information in i ProClass includes family relationships as well as structural and functional classifications and features. The current version consists of about 830 000 non-redundant PIR-PSD, SWISS-PROT, and TrEMBL proteins organized with more than 36 000 PIR superfamilies, 145 000 families, 4000 domains, 1300 motifs and 550 000 FASTA similarity clusters. It provides rich links to over 50 database of protein sequences, families, functions and pathways, protein–protein interactions, post-translational modifications, protein expressions, structures and structural classifications, genes and genomes, ontologies, literature and taxonomy. Protein and superfamily summary reports present extensive annotation information and include membership statistics and graphical display of domains and motifs. i ProClass employs an open and modular architecture for interoperability and scalability. It is implemented in the Oracle object-relational database system and is updated biweekly. The database is freely accessible from the web site at http://pir.georgetown.edu/iproclass/ and searchable by sequence or text string. The data integration in i ProClass supports exploration of protein relationships. Such knowledge is fundamental to the understanding of protein evolution, structure and function and crucial to functional genomic and proteomic research. 
 Protein export from the nucleus is often mediated by a Leucine-rich Nuclear Export Signal (NES). NESbase is a database of experimentally validated Leucine-rich NESs curated from literature. These signals are not annotated in databases such as SWISS-PROT, PIR or PROSITE. Each NESbase entry contains information of whether NES was shown to be necessary and/or sufficient for export, and whether the export was shown to be mediated by the export receptor CRM1. The compiled information was used to make a sequence logo of the Leucine-rich NESs, displaying the conservation of amino acids within a window of 25 residues. Surprisingly, only 36% of the sequences used for the logo fit the widely accepted NES consensus L-x(2,3)-[LIVFM]-x(2,3)-L-x-[LI]. The database is available online at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/NESbase/ . 
 In addition to maintaining the GenBank(R) nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides data analysis and retrieval resources for the data in GenBank and other biological data made available through NCBI's Web site. NCBI resources include Entrez, PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), LocusLink, the NCBITaxonomy Browser, BLAST, BLAST Link (BLink), Electronic PCR (e-PCR), Open Reading Frame (ORF) Finder, References Sequence (RefSeq), UniGene, HomoloGene, ProtEST, Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP), Human/Mouse Homology Map, Cancer Chromosome Aberration Project (CCAP), Entrez Genomes and related tools, the Map Viewer, Model Maker (MM), Evidence Viewer (EV), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database, Retroviral Genotyping Tools, SAGEmap, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), the Conserved Domain Database (CDD), and the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART). Augmenting many of the Web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets. All of the resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . 
 NetAffx ( http://www.affymetrix.com ) details and annotates probesets on Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. These annotations include (i) static information specific to the probeset composition; (ii) sequence annotations extracted from public databases; and (iii) protein sequence-level annotations derived from public domain programs, as well as libraries of hidden Markov models (HMMs) developed at Affymetrix. For each probeset, NetAffx lists the probe sequences, and the consensus sequence interrogated by the probes; for the larger chip sets, interactive maps display this sequence data in genomic context. Sequence annotations include Gene Ontology (GO) terms and depiction of GO graph relationships; predicted protein domains and motifs; orthologous sequences; links to relevant pathways; and links to public databases including UniGene, LocusLink, SWISS-PROT and OMIM. 
 The BayGenomics gene-trap resource ( http://baygenomics.ucsf.edu ) provides researchers with access to thousands of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines harboring characterized insertional mutations in both known and novel genes. Each cell line contains an insertional mutation in a specific gene. The identity of the gene that has been interrupted can be determined from a DNA sequence tag. Approximately 75% of our cell lines contain insertional mutations in known mouse genes or genes that share strong sequence similarities with genes that have been identified in other organisms. These cell lines readily transmit the mutation to the germline of mice and many mutant lines of mice have already been generated from this resource. BayGenomics provides facile access to our entire database, including sequence tags for each mutant ES cell line, through the World Wide Web. Investigators can browse our resource, search for specific entries, download any portion of our database and BLAST sequences of interest against our entire set of cell line sequence tags. They can then obtain the mutant ES cell line for the purpose of generating knockout mice. 
 ToxoDB ( http://ToxoDB.org ) provides a genome resource for the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii . Several sequencing projects devoted to T. gondii have been completed or are in progress: an EST project ( http://genome.wustl.edu/est/index.php?toxoplasma=1 ), a BAC clone end-sequencing project ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_gondii/ ) and an 8X random shotgun genomic sequencing project ( http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/tga1/ ). ToxoDB was designed to provide a central point of access for all available T. gondii data, and a variety of data mining tools useful for the analysis of unfinished, un-annotated draft sequence during the early phases of the genome project. In later stages, as more and different types of data become available (microarray, proteomic, SNP, QTL, etc.) the database will provide an integrated data analysis platform facilitating user-defined queries across the different data types. 
 PlantsP and PlantsT allow users to quickly gain a global understanding of plant phosphoproteins and plant membrane transporters, respectively, from evolutionary relationships to biochemical function as well as a deep understanding of the molecular biology of individual genes and their products. As one database with two functionally different web interfaces, PlantsP and PlantsT are curated plant-specific databases that combine sequence-derived information with experimental functional-genomics data. PlantsP focuses on proteins involved in the phosphorylation process (i.e., kinases and phosphatases), whereas PlantsT focuses on membrane transport proteins. Experimentally, PlantsP provides a resource for information on a collection of T-DNA insertion mutants (knockouts) in each kinase and phosphatase, primarily in Arabidopsis thaliana , and PlantsT uniquely combines experimental data regarding mineral composition (derived from inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy) of mutant and wild-type strains. Both databases provide extensive information on motifs and domains, detailed information contributed by individual experts in their respective fields, and descriptive information drawn directly from the literature. The databases incorporate a unique user annotation and review feature aimed at acquiring expert annotation directly from the plant biology community. PlantsP is available at http://plantsp.sdsc.edu and PlantsT is available at http://plantst.sdsc.edu . 
 The Plant snoRNA database ( http://www.scri.sari.ac.uk/plant_snoRNA/ ) provides information on small nucleolar RNAs from Arabidopsis and eighteen other plant species. Information includes sequences, expression data, methylation and pseudouridylation target modification sites, initial gene organization (polycistronic, single gene and intronic) and the number of gene variants. The Arabidopsis information is divided into box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs, and within each of these groups, by target sites in rRNA, snRNA or unknown. Alignments of orthologous genes and gene variants from different plant species are available for many snoRNA genes. Plant snoRNA genes have been given a standard nomenclature, designed wherever possible, to provide a consistent identity with yeast and human orthologues. 
 The University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (UM-BBD, http://umbbd.ahc.umn.edu/ ) provides curated information on microbial catabolism and related biotransformations, primarily for environmental pollutants. Currently, it contains information on over 130 metabolic pathways, 800 reactions, 750 compounds and 500 enzymes. In the past two years, it has increased its breath to include more examples of microbial metabolism of metals and metalloids; and expanded the types of information it includes to contain microbial biotransformations of, and binding interactions with many chemical elements. It has also increased the ways in which this data can be accessed (mined). Structure-based searching was added, for exact matches, similarity, or substructures. Analysis of UM-BBD reactions has lead to a prototype, guided, pathway prediction system. Guided prediction means that the user is shown all possible biotransformations at each step and guides the process to its conclusion. Mining the UM-BBD's data provides a unique view into how the microbial world recycles organic functional groups. UM-BBD users are encouraged to comment on all aspects of the database, including the information it contains and the tools by which it can be mined. The database and prediction system develop under the direction of the scientific community. 
 Group II introns are self-splicing RNAs and retroelements found in bacteria and lower eukaryotic organelles. During the past several years, they have been uncovered in surprising numbers in bacteria due to the genome sequencing projects; however, most of the newly sequenced introns are not correctly identified. We have initiated an ongoing web site database for mobile group II introns in order to provide correct information on the introns, particularly in bacteria. Information in the web site includes: (1) introductory information on group II introns; (2) detailed information on subfamilies of intron RNA structures and intron-encoded proteins; (3) a listing of identified introns with correct boundaries, RNA secondary structures and other detailed information; and (4) phylogenetic and evolutionary information. The comparative data should facilitate study of the function, spread and evolution of group II introns. The database can be accessed at http://www.fp.ucalgary.ca/group2introns/ . 
 The Prostate Gene Database (PGDB: http://www.ucsf.edu/pgdb ) is a curated and integrated database of genes or genomic loci related to the human prostate and prostatic diseases. Currently, PGDB covers genes involved in a number of molecular and genetic events of the prostate including gene amplification, mutation, gross deletion, methylation, polymorphism, linkage and over-expression, as published in the literature. Genes that are specifically expressed in prostate, as evidenced by analysis of data from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), are also included. There are a total of 165 unique entries in the database. Users can either browse or query the PGDB through a web interface. For each gene, in addition to basic gene information and rich cross-references to other databases, inclusive and relevant literature references are provided to support the inclusion of the gene in the database. Detailed expression data calculated from the UniGene and SAGEmap databases are also presented. 
 The RECODE database is a compilation of translational recoding events (programmed ribosomal frameshifting, codon redefinition and translational bypass). The database provides information about the genes utilizing these events for their expression, recoding sites, stimulatory sequences and other relevant information. The Database is freely available at http://recode.genetics.utah.edu/ . 
 The MIPS Rice ( Oryza sativa ) database (MOsDB; http://mips.gsf.de/proj/rice ) provides a comprehensive data collection dedicated to the genome information of rice. Rice ( O. sativa L.) is one of the most important food crops for over half the world's population and serves as a major model system in cereal genome research. MOsDB integrates data from two publicly available rice genomic sequences, O. sativa L. ssp. indica and O. sativa L. ssp. japonica. Besides regularly updated rice genome sequence information, MOsDB provides an integrated resource for associated analysis data, e.g. internal and external annotation information as well as a complex characterization of all annotated rice genes. The MOsDB web interface supports various search options and allows browsing the database content. MOsDB is continuously expanding to include an increasing range of data type and the growing amount of information on the rice genome. 
 The Molecular Biology Database Collection is an online resource listing key databases of value to the biological community. This Collection is intended to bring fellow scientists' attention to high-quality databases that are available throughout the world, rather than just be a lengthy listing of all available databases. As such, this up-to-date listing is intended to serve as the jumping-off point from which to find specialized databases that may be of use in advancing biological research. The databases included in this Collection provide new value to the underlying data by virtue of curation, new data connections or other innovative approaches. Short, searchable summaries and updates for each of the databases included in this Collection are available through the Nucleic Acids Research Web site at http://nar.oupjournals.org . 
 The E-MSD macromolecular structure relational database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd ) is designed to be a single access point for protein and nucleic acid structures and related information. The database is derived from Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries. Relational database technologies are used in a comprehensive cleaning procedure to ensure data uniformity across the whole archive. The search database contains an extensive set of derived properties, goodness-of-fit indicators, and links to other EBI databases including InterPro, GO, and SWISS-PROT, together with links to SCOP, CATH, PFAM and PROSITE. A generic search interface is available, coupled with a fast secondary structure domain search tool. 
 The Biodegradative Strain Database (BSD) is a freely-accessible, web-based database providing detailed information on degradative bacteria and the hazardous substances that they degrade, including corresponding literature citations, relevant patents and links to additional web-based biological and chemical data. The BSD ( http://bsd.cme.msu.edu ) is being developed within the phylogenetic framework of the Ribosomal Database Project II (RDPII: http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/html ) to provide a biological complement to the chemical and degradative pathway data of the University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (UM-BBD: http://umbbd.ahc.umn.edu ). Data is accessible through a series of strain, chemical and reference lists or by keyword search. The web site also includes on-line data submission and user survey forms to solicit user contributions and suggestions. The current release contains information on over 250 degradative bacterial strains and 150 hazardous substances. The transformation of xenobiotics and other environmentally toxic compounds by microorganisms is central to strategies for biocatalysis and the bioremediation of contaminated environments. However, practical, comprehensive, strain-level information on biocatalytic/biodegradative microbes is not readily available and is often difficult to compile. Similarly, for any given environmental contaminant, there is no single resource that can provide comparative information on the array of identified microbes capable of degrading the chemical. A web site that consolidates and cross-references strain, chemical and reference data related to biocatalysis, biotransformation, biodegradation and bioremediation would be an invaluable tool for academic and industrial researchers and environmental engineers. 
 The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system provides the first random insertional mutagen available for germline genetic screens in mice. In preparation for a large scale project to create, map and manage up to 5000 SB insertions, we have developed the Mouse Transposon Insertion Database (MTID; http://mouse.ccgb.umn.edu/transposon/ ). Each insertion's genomic position, as well as the distance between the insertion and the nearest annotated gene, are determined by a sequence analysis pipeline. Users can search the database using a specified nucleotide or genetic map position to identify the nearest insertion. Mouse reports describe insertions carried, strain, genotype and dates of birth and death. Insertion reports describes chromosome, nucleotide and genetic map positions, as well as nearest gene data from Ensembl, NCBI and Celera. The flanking sequence used to map the insertion is also provided. Researchers will be able to identify insertions of interest and request mice or frozen sperm that carry the insertion. 
 The HIV reverse transcriptase and protease sequence database is an on-line relational database that catalogues evolutionary and drug-related sequence variation in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease enzymes, the molecular targets of antiretroviral therapy ( http://hivdb.stanford.edu ). The database contains a compilation of nearly all published HIV RT and protease sequences, including submissions to GenBank, sequences published in journal articles and sequences of HIV isolates from persons participating in clinical trials. Sequences are linked to data about the source of the sequence, the antiretroviral drug treatment history of the person from whom the sequence was obtained and the results of in vitro drug susceptibility testing. Sequence data on two new molecular targets of HIV drug therapy—gp41 (cell fusion) and integrase—will be added to the database in 2003. 
 RNABase is a unified database of all three-dimensional structures containing RNA deposited in either the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or Nucleic Acid Data Base (NDB). For each structure, RNABase contains a brief summary as well as annotation of conformational parameters, identification of possible model errors, Ramachandran-style conformational maps and classification of ribonucleotides into conformers. These same analyses can also be performed on structures submitted by users. To facilitate access, structures are automatically placed into a variety of functional and structural categories, including: ribozymes, pseudoknots, etc. RNABase can be freely accessed on the web at http://www.rnabase.org . We are committed to maintaining this database indefinitely. 
 The Horizontal Gene Transfer DataBase (HGT-DB) is a genomic database that includes statistical parameters such as G+C content, codon and amino-acid usage, as well as information about which genes deviate in these parameters for prokaryotic complete genomes. Under the hypothesis that genes from distantly related species have different nucleotide compositions, these deviated genes may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. The current version of the database contains 88 bacterial and archaeal complete genomes, including multiple chromosomes and strains. For each genome, the database provides statistical parameters for all the genes, as well as averages and standard deviations of G+C content, codon usage, relative synonymous codon usage and amino-acid content. It also provides information about correspondence analyses of the codon usage, plus lists of extraneous group of genes in terms of G+C content and lists of putatively acquired genes. With this information, researchers can explore the G+C content and codon usage of a gene when they find incongruities in sequence-based phylogenetic trees. A search engine that allows searches for gene names or keywords for a specific organism is also available. HGT-DB is freely accessible at http://www.fut.es/~debb/HGT.
 WormBase ( http://www.wormbase.org/ ) is a web-accessible central data repository for information about Caenorhabditis elegans and related nematodes. The past two years have seen a significant expansion in the biological scope of WormBase, including the integration of large-scale, genome-wide data sets, the inclusion of genome sequence and gene predictions from related species and active literature curation. This expansion of data has also driven the development and refinement of user interfaces and operability, including a new Genome Browser, new searches and facilities for data access and the inclusion of extensive documentation. These advances have expanded WormBase beyond the obvious target audience of C. elegans researchers, to include researchers wishing to explore problems in functional and comparative genomics within the context of a powerful genetic system. 
CnidBase , the Cnidarian Evolutionary Genomics Database, is a tool for investigating the evolutionary, developmental and ecological factors that affect gene expression and gene function in cnidarians. In turn, CnidBase will help to illuminate the role of specific genes in shaping cnidarian biodiversity in the present day and in the distant past. CnidBase highlights evolutionary changes between species within the phylum Cnidaria and structures genomic and expression data to facilitate comparisons to non-cnidarian metazoans. CnidBase aims to further the progress that has already been made in the realm of cnidarian evolutionary genomics by creating a central community resource which will help drive future research and facilitate more accurate classification and comparison of new experimental data with existing data. CnidBase is available at http://cnidbase.bu.edu/.
 The SeedGenes database ( http://www.seedgenes.org ) presents molecular and phenotypic information on essential, non-redundant genes of Arabidopsis that give a seed phenotype when disrupted by mutation. Experimental details are synthesized for efficient use by the community and organized into two major sections in the database, one dealing with genes and the other with mutant alleles. The database can be queried for detailed information on a single gene to create a SeedGenes Profile. Queries can also generate lists of genes or mutants that fit specified criteria. The long-term goal is to establish a complete collection of Arabidopsis genes that give a knockout phenotype. This information is needed to focus attention on genes with important cellular functions in a model plant and to assess from a genetic perspective the extent of functional redundancy in the Arabidopsis genome. 
 GOBASE is a relational database containing integrated sequence, RNA secondary structure and biochemical and taxonomic information about organelles. GOBASE release 6 (summer 2002) contains over 130 000 mitochondrial sequences, an increase of 37% over the previous release, and more than 30 000 chloroplast sequences in a new auxiliary database. To handle this flood of new data, we have designed and implemented GOpop, a Java system for population and verification of the database. We have also implemented a more powerful and flexible user interface using the PHP programming language. http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/gobase/gobase.html.
 Three-dimensional structures are now known within most protein families and it is likely, when searching a sequence database, that one will identify a homolog of known structure. The goal of Entrez's 3D-structure database is to make structure information and the functional annotation it can provide easily accessible to molecular biologists. To this end, Entrez's search engine provides several powerful features: (i) links between databases, for example between a protein's sequence and structure; (ii) pre-computed sequence and structure neighbors; and (iii) structure and sequence/structure alignment visualization. Here, we focus on a new feature of Entrez's Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB): Graphical summaries of the biological annotation available for each 3D structure, based on the results of automated comparative analysis. MMDB is available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/structure.html . 
 REBASE contains comprehensive information about restriction enzymes, DNA methyltransferases and related proteins such as nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control proteins. It contains published and unpublished references, recognition and cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, crystal and sequence data. Homing endonucleases are also included. REBASE contains the most complete and up-to-date information about the methylation sensitivity of restriction endonucleases. In addition, there is extensive information about the known and putative restriction-modification (R-M) systems in more than 100 sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes. The data is available on the web ( http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html ), through ftp ( ftp.neb.com ) and as monthly updates via email. 
 Transmembrane Helices in Genome Sequences (THGS) is an interactive web‐based database, developed to search the transmembrane helices in the user‐interested gene sequences available in the Genome Database (GDB). The proposed database has provision to search sequence motifs in transmembrane and globular proteins. In addition, the motif can be searched in the other sequence databases (Swiss‐Prot and PIR) or in the macromolecular structure database, Protein Data Bank (PDB). Further, the 3D structure of the corresponding queried motif, if it is available in the solved protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank, can also be visualized using the widely used graphics package RASMOL. All the sequence databases used in the present work are updated frequently and hence the results produced are up to date. The database THGS is freely available via the world wide web and can be accessed at http:// pranag.physics.iisc.ernet.in/thgs/ or http://144.16. 71.10/thgs/ . 
 An elaboration of HERVd ( http://herv.img.cas.cz ) is being carried out in two directions. One of them is the integration and better classification of families that diverge considerably from typical retroviral genomes. This leads to a more precise identification of members with individual families. The second improvement is better accessibility of the database and connection with human genome annotation. 
 We have implemented LIFEdb ( http://www.dkfz.de/LIFEdb ) to link information regarding novel human full‐length cDNAs generated and sequenced by the German cDNA Consortium with functional information on the encoded proteins produced in functional genomics and proteomics approaches. The database also serves as a sample‐tracking system to manage the process from cDNA to experimental read‐out and data interpretation. A web interface enables the scientific community to explore and visualize features of the annotated cDNAs and ORFs combined with experimental results, and thus helps to unravel new features of proteins with as yet unknown functions. 
 The ASTRAL Compendium provides several databases and tools to aid in the analysis of protein structures, particularly through the use of their sequences. Partially derived from the SCOP database of protein structure domains, it includes sequences for each domain and other resources useful for studying these sequences and domain structures. The current release of ASTRAL contains 54 745 domains, more than three times as many as the initial release 4 years ago. ASTRAL has undergone major transformations in the past 2 years. In addition to several complete updates each year, ASTRAL is now updated on a weekly basis with preliminary classifications of domains from newly released PDB structures. These classifications are available as a stand‐alone database, as well as integrated into other ASTRAL databases such as representative subsets. To enhance the utility of ASTRAL to structural biologists, all SCOP domains are now made available as PDB‐style coordinate files as well as sequences. In addition to sequences and representative subsets based on SCOP domains, sequences and subsets based on PDB chains are newly included in ASTRAL. Several search tools have been added to ASTRAL to facilitate retrieval of data by individual users and automated methods. ASTRAL may be accessed at http://astral.stanford. edu/ . 
 The Soybean Genomics and Microarray Database (SGMD) attempts to provide an integrated view of the interaction of soybean with the soybean cyst nematode and contains genomic, EST and microarray data with embedded analytical tools allowing correlation of soybean ESTs with their gene expression profiles. SGMD provides analytical tools to mine the microarray data quickly by integrating many analysis methods within the database itself. The expression profiles of genes at time intervals during the first 8 days of nematode invasion is searchable by gene name or GenBank accession number. Recent developments include the addition of a searchable database for soybean cyst nematode ESTs and photographs of the invasion process at time points examined using microarrays. SGMD is completely accessible from the web at: http://psi081.ba.ars.usda.gov/SGMD/default.htm . 
 A grand challenge in the post‐genomic era is a complete computer representation of the cell and the organism, which will enable computational prediction of higher‐level complexity of cellular processes and organism behavior from genomic information. Toward this end we have been developing a knowledge‐based approach for network prediction, which is to predict, given a complete set of genes in the genome, the protein interaction networks that are responsible for various cellular processes. KEGG at http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ is the reference knowledge base that integrates current knowledge on molecular interaction networks such as pathways and complexes (PATHWAY database), information about genes and proteins generated by genome projects (GENES/SSDB/KO databases) and information about biochemical compounds and reactions (COMPOUND/GLYCAN/REACTION databases). These three types of database actually represent three graph objects, called the protein network, the gene universe and the chemical universe. New efforts are being made to abstract knowledge, both computationally and manually, about ortholog clusters in the KO (KEGG Orthology) database, and to collect and analyze carbohydrate structures in the GLYCAN database. 
 NEMBASE (available at http://www.nematodes.org ) is a publicly available online database providing access to the sequence and associated meta‐data currently being generated as part of the Edinburgh–Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute parasitic nematode EST project. NEMBASE currently holds ∼100 000 sequences from 10 different species of nematode. To facilitate ease of use, sequences have been processed to generate a non‐redundant set of gene objects (‘partial genome’) for each species. Users may query the database on the basis of BLAST annotation, sequence similarity or expression profiles. NEMBASE also features an interactive Java‐based tool (SimiTri) which allows the simultaneous display and analysis of the relative similarity relationships of groups of sequences to three different databases. NEMBASE is currently being expanded to include sequence data from other nematode species. Other developments include access to accurate peptide predictions, improved functional annotation and incorporation of automated processes allowing rapid analysis of nematode‐specific gene families. 
 Prokaryotic chromosomes often contain islands, such as temperate phages or pathogenicity islands, delivered by site‐specific integrases. Integration usually occurs within a tRNA or tmRNA gene, splitting the gene, yet sequences within the island restore the disrupted gene. The regenerated RNA gene and the displaced fragment of that gene thus mark the endpoints of the island. We applied this principle to search for islands in genomic DNA sequences. Our algorithm generates a list of tRNA and tmRNA genes, uses each as the query for a BLAST search of the starting DNA and removes unlikely hits through a series of filters. A search for islands in 106 whole bacterial genomes produced 143 candidates, with the search itself providing an estimate of three false candidates among these. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the associated integrases reduced this set to 89 cases of independently evolved site specificity, which showed strong bias for the tmRNA gene. The website Islander ( http://www.indiana.edu/∼islander ) presents the candidate islands in GenBank‐style files and correlates integrase phylogeny with site specificity. 
 The Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.pdb.org ) is the primary source of information on the 3D structure of biological macromolecules. The PDB’s mandate is to disseminate this information in the most usable form and as widely as possible. The current query and distribution system is described and an alpha version of the future re‐engineered system introduced. 
 The Signal Transduction Classification Database (STCDB) is a database of information relative to the classification of signal transduction. It is based primarily on a proposed classification of signal transduction and it describes each type of characterized signal transduction for which a unique ST number has been provided. This document presents, in its first version, the classification of signal transduction in eukaryotic cells. Approved classifications are available for web browsing at http://www.techfak.uni‐bielefeld.de/∼mchen/STCDB . 
 The Ensembl ( http://www.ensembl.org/ ) database project provides a bioinformatics framework to organize biology around the sequences of large genomes. It is a comprehensive and integrated source of annotation of large genome sequences, available via interactive website, web services or flat files. As well as being one of the leading sources of genome annotation, Ensembl is an open source software engineering project to develop a portable system able to handle very large genomes and associated requirements. The facilities of the system range from sequence analysis to data storage and visualization and installations exist around the world both in companies and at academic sites. With a total of nine genome sequences available from Ensembl and more genomes to follow, recent developments have focused mainly on closer integration between genomes and external data. 
 SCOR, the Structural Classification of RNA ( http://scor.lbl.gov ), is a database designed to provide a comprehensive perspective and understanding of RNA motif three‐dimensional structure, function, tertiary interactions and their relationships. SCOR 2.0 represents a major expansion and introduces a new classification organization. The new version represents the classification as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which allows a classification node to have multiple parents, in contrast to the strictly hierarchical classification used in SCOR 1.2. SCOR 2.0 supports three types of query terms in the updated search engine: PDB or NDB identifier, nucleotide sequence and keyword. We also provide parseable XML files for all information. This new release contains 511 RNA entries from the PDB as of 15 May 2003. A total of 5880 secondary structural elements are classified: 2104 hairpin loops and 3776 internal loops. RNA motifs reported in the literature, such as ‘Kink turn’ and ‘GNRA loops’, are now incorporated into the structural classification along with definitions and descriptions. 
 Flytrap is a web‐enabled relational database of transposable element insertions in Drosophila melanogaster . A green fluorescent protein (GFP) artificial exon carried by a transposable P ‐element is mobilized and inserted into a host gene intron creating a GFP fusion protein. The sequence of the tagged gene is determined by sequencing inverse‐PCR products derived from genomic DNA. Flytrap contains two principle data types: micrographs of protein localization and a cellular component ontology, based on rules derived from the Gene Ontology consortium ( http://www.geneontology.org ), describing protein localization. Flytrap also has links to gene information contained in Flybase ( http:// flybase.bio.indiana.edu ). The system is designed to accept submissions of micrographs and descriptions from any type of tissue (e.g. wing imaginal disk, ovary) and at any stage of development. Insertion lines can be searched using a number of queries, including Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) numbers and protein localization. In addition, Flytrap provides online order forms linked to each insertion line so that users may request any line generated from this project. Flytrap may be accessed from the homepage at http://flytrap.med. yale.edu . 
 Currently, the Genomic Threading Database (GTD) contains structural assignments for the proteins encoded within the genomes of nine eukaryotes and 101 prokaryotes. Structural annotations are carried out using a modified version of GenTHREADER, a reliable fold recognition method. The Gen THREADER annotation jobs are distributed across multiple clusters of processors using grid technology and the predictions are deposited in a relational database accessible via a web interface at http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/GTD . Using this system, up to 84% of proteins encoded within a genome can be confidently assigned to known folds with 72% of the residues aligned. On average in the GTD, 64% of proteins encoded within a genome are confidently assigned to known folds and 58% of the residues are aligned to structures. 
 Gene trap mutagenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells generates random loss‐of‐function mutations, which can be identified by a sequence tag and can often report the endogenous expression of the mutated gene. The Centre for Modeling Human Disease is performing expression‐ and sequence‐based screens of gene trap insertions to generate new mouse mutations as a resource for the scientific community. The gene trap insertions are screened using multiplexed in vitro differentiation and induction assays, and sequence tags are generated to complement expression profiles. Researchers may search for insertions in genes expressed in target cell lineages, under specific in vitro conditions, or based upon sequence identity via an online searchable database ( http://www.cmhd.ca/sub/genetrap.asp ). The clones are available as a resource to researchers worldwide to help to functionally annotate the mammalian genome and will serve as a source to test candidate loci identified by phenotype‐driven mutagenesis screens. 
 GermOnline provides information and microarray expression data for genes involved in mitosis and meiosis, gamete formation and germ line development across species. The database has been developed, and is being curated and updated, by life scientists in cooperation with bioinformaticists. Information is contributed through an online form using free text, images and the controlled vocabulary developed by the GeneOntology Consortium. Authors provide up to three references in support of their contribution. The database is governed by an international board of scientists to ensure a standardized data format and the highest quality of GermOnline’s information content. Release 2.0 provides exclusive access to microarray expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rattus norvegicus , as well as curated information on ∼700 genes from various organisms. The locus report pages include links to external databases that contain relevant annotation, microarray expression and proteome data. Conversely, the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), S.cerevisiae GeneDB and Swiss‐Prot link to the budding yeast section of GermOnline from their respective locus pages. GermOnline, a fully operational prototype subject‐oriented knowledgebase designed for community annotation and array data visualization, is accessible at http://www.germonline.org . The target audience includes researchers who work on mitotic cell division, meiosis, gametogenesis, germ line development, human reproductive health and comparative genomics. 
 RNA interference (RNAi) is being used in large‐scale genomic studies as a rapid way to obtain in vivo functional information associated with specific genes. How best to archive and mine the complex data derived from these studies provides a series of challenges associated with both the methods used to elicit the RNAi response and the functional data gathered. RNAiDB (RNAi Database; http://www. rnai.org ) has been created for the archival, distribution and analysis of phenotypic data from large‐scale RNAi analyses in Caenorhabditis elegans . The database contains a compendium of publicly available data and provides information on experimental methods and phenotypic results, including raw data in the form of images and streaming time‐lapse movies. Phenotypic summaries together with graphical displays of RNAi to gene mappings allow quick intuitive comparison of results from different RNAi assays and visualization of the gene product(s) potentially inhibited by each RNAi experiment based on multiple sequence analysis methods. RNAiDB can be searched using combinatorial queries and using the novel tool PhenoBlast, which ranks genes according to their overall phenotypic similarity. RNAiDB could serve as a model database for distributing and navigating in vivo functional information from large‐scale systematic phenotypic analyses in different organisms. 
 The annotation of protein function has become a crucial problem with the advent of sequence and structural genomics initiatives. A large body of evidence suggests that protein structural information is frequently encoded in local sequences, and that folds are mainly made up of a number of simple local units of super‐secondary structural motifs, consisting of a few secondary structures and their connecting loops. Moreover, protein loops play an important role in protein function. Here we present ArchDB, a classification database of structural motifs, consisting of one loop plus its bracing secondary structures. ArchDB currently contains 12 665 super‐secondary elements classified into 1496 motif subclasses. The database provides an easy way to retrieve functional information from protein structures sharing a common motif, to search motifs found in a given SCOP family, superfamily or fold, or to search by keywords on proteins with classified loops. The ArchDB database of loops is located at http://sbi.imim.es/archdb . 
 Publicly accessible DNA databases (genome browsers) are rapidly accelerating post‐genomic research (see http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/ ), with integrated genomic DNA, gene structure, EST/ splicing and cross‐species ortholog data. DNA databases have relatively low dimensionality; the genome is a linear code that anchors all associated data. In contrast, RNA expression and protein databases need to be able to handle very high dimensional data, with time, tissue, cell type and genes, as interrelated variables. The high dimensionality of microarray expression profile data, and the lack of a standard experimental platform have complicated the development of web‐accessible databases and analytical tools. We have designed and implemented a public resource of expression profile data containing 1024 human, mouse and rat Affymetrix GeneChip expression profiles, generated in the same laboratory, and subject to the same quality and procedural controls (Public Expression Profiling Resource; PEPR). Our Oracle‐based PEPR data warehouse includes a novel time series query analysis tool (SGQT), enabling dynamic generation of graphs and spreadsheets showing the action of any transcript of interest over time. In this report, we demonstrate the utility of this tool using a 27 time point, in vivo muscle regeneration series. This data warehouse and associated analysis tools provides access to multidimensional microarray data through web‐based interfaces, both for download of all types of raw data for independent analysis, and also for straightforward gene‐based queries. Planned implementations of PEPR will include web‐based remote entry of projects adhering to quality control and standard operating procedure (QC/SOP) criteria, and automated output of alternative probe set algorithms for each project (see http://microarray.cnmcresearch.org/pgadatatable.asp ). 
 The SURFACE (SUrface Residues and Functions Annotated, Compared and Evaluated, URL http://cbm.bio.uniroma2.it/surface/ ) database is a repository of annotated and compared protein surface regions. SURFACE contains the results of a large‐scale protein annotation and local structural comparison project. A non‐redundant set of protein chains is used to build a database of protein surface patches, defined as putative surface functional sites. Each patch is annotated with sequence and structure‐derived information about function or interaction abilities. A new procedure for structure comparison is used to perform an all‐versus‐all patches comparison. Selection of the results obtained with stringent parameters offers a similarity score that can be used to associate different patches and allows reliable annotation by similarity. Annotation exerted through the comparison of regions of protein surface allows the highlighting of similarities that cannot be recognized by other methods of sequence or structure comparison. A graphic representation of the surface patches, functional annotations and the structural superpositions is available through the web interface. 
 The Human Genome Variation Database (HGVbase; http://hgvbase.cgb.ki.se ) has provided a curated summary of human DNA variation for more than 5 years, thus facilitating research into DNA sequence variation and human phenotypes. The database has undergone many changes and improvements to accommodate increasing volumes and new types of data. The focus of HGVbase has recently shifted towards information on haplotypes and phenotypes, relationships between phenotypes and DNA variation, and collaborative efforts to provide a global resource for genome–phenome data. Open sharing and precise phenotype definitions are necessary to advance the current understanding of common diseases that are typified by complex aetiologies, small genetic effect sizes and multiple confounding factors that obscure positive study results. Association data will increasingly be collected as part of this new project thrust. This report describes the evolving features of HGVbase, and covers in detail the technological choices we have made to enable efficient storage and data mining of increasingly large and complex data sets. 
 IMGT/3Dstructure‐DB and IMGT/Structural‐Query are a novel 3D structure database and a new tool for immunological proteins. They are part of IMGT, the international ImMunoGenetics information system®, a high‐quality integrated knowledge resource specializing in immunoglobulins (IG), T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of human and other vertebrate species, which consists of databases, Web resources and interactive on‐line tools. IMGT/3Dstructure‐DB data are described according to the IMGT Scientific chart rules based on the IMGT‐ONTOLOGY concepts. IMGT/3Dstructure‐DB provides IMGT gene and allele identification of IG, TR and MHC proteins with known 3D structures, domain delimitations, amino acid positions according to the IMGT unique numbering and renumbered coordinate flat files. Moreover IMGT/3Dstructure‐DB provides 2D graphical representations (or Collier de Perles) and results of contact analysis. The IMGT/StructuralQuery tool allows search of this database based on specific structural characteristics. IMGT/3Dstructure‐DB and IMGT/StructuralQuery are freely available at http://imgt. cines.fr . 
 The main goal of CleanEx is to provide access to public gene expression data via unique gene names. A second objective is to represent heterogeneous expression data produced by different technologies in a way that facilitates joint analysis and cross‐data set comparisons. A consistent and up‐to‐date gene nomenclature is achieved by associating each single experiment with a permanent target identifier consisting of a physical description of the targeted RNA population or the hybridization reagent used. These targets are then mapped at regular intervals to the growing and evolving catalogues of human genes and genes from model organisms. The completely automatic mapping procedure relies partly on external genome information resources such as UniGene and RefSeq. The central part of CleanEx is a weekly built gene index containing cross‐references to all public expression data already incorporated into the system. In addition, the expression target database of CleanEx provides gene mapping and quality control information for various types of experimental resource, such as cDNA clones or Affymetrix probe sets. The web‐based query interfaces offer access to individual entries via text string searches or quantitative expression criteria. CleanEx is accessible at: http://www.cleanex.isb‐sib.ch/ . 
 The KNOTTIN website and database organize information about knottins or inhibitor cystine knots, small disulfide‐rich proteins with a knotted topology. Thanks to their small size and high stability, knottins provide appealing scaffolds for protein engineering and drug design. Static pages present the main historical and recent results about knottin discoveries, sequences, structures, folding, functions, applications and bibliography. Database searches provide dynamically generated tabular reports or sequence alignments for knottin three‐dimensional structures or sequences. BLAST/HMM searches are also available. A simple nomenclature, based on loop lengths between cysteines, is proposed and is complemented by a uniform numbering scheme. This standardization is applied to all knottin structures in the database, facilitating comparisons. Renumbered and structurally fitted knottin PDB files are available for download. The standardized numbering is used for automatic drawing of two‐dimensional Colliers de Perles. The KNOTTIN website and database are available at http://knottin.cbs.cnrs.fr and http://knottin.com . 
 BRENDA (BRaunschweig ENzyme DAtabase) represents a comprehensive collection of enzyme and metabolic information, based on primary literature. The database contains data from at least 83 000 different enzymes from 9800 different organisms, classified in ∼4200 EC numbers. BRENDA includes biochemical and molecular information on classification and nomenclature, reaction and specificity, functional parameters, occurrence, enzyme structure, application, engineering, stability, disease, isolation and preparation, links and literature references. The data are extracted and evaluated from ∼46 000 references, which are linked to PubMed as long as the reference is cited in PubMed. In the past year BRENDA has undergone major changes including a large increase in updating speed with >50% of all data updated in 2002 or in the first half of 2003, the development of a new EC‐tree browser, a taxonomy‐tree browser, a chemical substructure search engine for ligand structure, the development of controlled vocabulary, an ontology for some information fields and a thesaurus for ligand names. The database is accessible free of charge to the academic community at http://www.brenda. uni‐koeln.de . 
 The Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database is a comprehensive ordering of all proteins of known structure, according to their evolutionary and structural relationships. Protein domains in SCOP are hierarchically classified into families, superfamilies, folds and classes. The continual accumulation of sequence and structural data allows more rigorous analysis and provides important information for understanding the protein world and its evolutionary repertoire. SCOP participates in a project that aims to rationalize and integrate the data on proteins held in several sequence and structure databases. As part of this project, starting with release 1.63, we have initiated a refinement of the SCOP classification, which introduces a number of changes mostly at the levels below superfamily. The pending SCOP reclassification will be carried out gradually through a number of future releases. In addition to the expanded set of static links to external resources, available at the level of domain entries, we have started modernization of the interface capabilities of SCOP allowing more dynamic links with other databases. SCOP can be accessed at http://scop.mrc‐lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop . 
 The Protein Information Resource (PIR) is an integrated public resource of protein informatics. To facilitate the sensible propagation and standardization of protein annotation and the systematic detection of annotation errors, PIR has extended its superfamily concept and developed the SuperFamily (PIRSF) classification system. Based on the evolutionary relationships of whole proteins, this classification system allows annotation of both specific biological and generic biochemical functions. The system adopts a network structure for protein classification from superfamily to subfamily levels. Protein family members are homologous (sharing common ancestry) and homeomorphic (sharing full‐length sequence similarity with common domain architecture). The PIRSF database consists of two data sets, preliminary clusters and curated families. The curated families include family name, protein membership, parent–child relationship, domain architecture, and optional description and bibliography. PIRSF is accessible from the website at http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirsf/ for report retrieval and sequence classification. The report presents family annotation, membership statistics, cross‐references to other databases, graphical display of domain architecture, and links to multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for curated families. PIRSF can be utilized to analyze phylogenetic profiles, to reveal functional convergence and divergence, and to identify interesting relationships between homeomorphic families, domains and structural classes. 
 The Macromolecular Structure Database (MSD) group ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd/ ) continues to enhance the quality and consistency of macromolecular structure data in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and to work towards the integration of various bioinformatics data resources. We have implemented a simple form‐based interface that allows users to query the MSD directly. The MSD ‘atlas pages’ show all of the information in the MSD for a particular PDB entry. The group has designed new search interfaces aimed at specific areas of interest, such as the environment of ligands and the secondary structures of proteins. We have also implemented a novel search interface that begins to integrate separate MSD search services in a single graphical tool. We have worked closely with collaborators to build a new visualization tool that can present both structure and sequence data in a unified interface, and this data viewer is now used throughout the MSD services for the visualization and presentation of search results. Examples showcasing the functionality and power of these tools are available from tutorial webpages ( http://www. ebi.ac.uk/msd‐srv/docs/roadshow_tutorial/ ). 
 The Mouse SAGE Site is a web‐based database of all available public libraries generated by the Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) from various mouse tissues and cell lines. The database contains mouse SAGE libraries organized in a uniform way and provides web‐based tools for browsing, comparing and searching SAGE data with reliable tag‐to‐gene identification. A modified approach based on the SAGEmap database is used for reliable tag identification. The Mouse SAGE Site is maintained on an ongoing basis at the Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and is accessible at the internet address http://mouse.biomed.cas.cz/sage/ . 
 The KinG database is a comprehensive collection of serine/threonine/tyrosine‐specific kinases and their homologues identified in various completed genomes using sequence and profile search methods. The database hosted at http://hodgkin. mbu.iisc.ernet.in/∼king provides the amino acid sequences, functional domain assignments and classification of gene products containing protein kinase domains. A search tool enabling the retrieval of protein kinases with specified subfamily and domain combinations is one of the key features of the resource. Identification of a kinase catalytic domain in the user’s query sequence is possible using another search tool. The occurrence and location of critical catalytic residues if the query has a catalytic kinase domain, recognition of non‐kinase domains in the sequence and subfamily classification of the kinase in the query will help in deciphering the biological role of the kinase. This online compilation can also be used to compare the protein kinases of a given subfamily and domain combinations across various genomes. Another exclusive feature of the database is the collection of the Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases and similar sequences encoded in the genomes of archaea and bacteria. 
 In the past year we at DDBJ ( http://www.ddbj.nig. ac.jp ) have made a steady increase in the number of data submissions with a 50.6% increment in the number of bases or 46.5% increment in the number of entries. Among them the genome data of man, ascidian and rice hold the top three. Our activity has extended to providing a tool that enables sequence retrieval using regular expressions, and to launching our SOAP server and web services to facilitate the acquisition of proper data and tools from a huge number of biological data resources on websites worldwide. We have also opened our public gene expression database, CIBEX. 
 Nuclear hormone receptors are an abundant class of ligand‐activated transcriptional regulators, found in varying numbers in all animals. Based on our experience of managing the official nomenclature of nuclear receptors, we have developed NUREBASE, a database containing protein and DNA sequences, reviewed protein alignments and phylogenies, taxonomy and annotations for all nuclear receptors. New developments in NUREBASE include explicit declaration of alternative transcripts of each gene, and expression data for human and mouse nuclear receptors. The core of NUREBASE is reviewed, and it is completed by NUREBASE_DAILY, automatically updated every 24 h. All information on accessing and installing NUREBASE may be found at http://www. ens‐lyon.fr/LBMC/laudet/nurebase/nurebase.html . 
 We have been developing a Human Unidentified Gene‐Encoded (HUGE) protein database ( http://www.kazusa.or.jp/huge ) to summarize results from sequence analysis of human novel large (>4 kb) cDNAs identified in the Kazusa cDNA sequencing project. At present, HUGE contains 2031 cDNA entries (KIAA cDNAs), for each of which a gene/protein characteristic table has been prepared. Since we have been shifting our research attention from the identification and cloning of novel cDNAs to the functional analysis of the proteins encoded by these cDNAs (KIAA proteins), we have not substantially increased the number of cDNA entries in HUGE for some time. Instead, we have manually curated 451 KIAA cDNAs in order to prepare a set of genetic resources to facilitate the functional analysis of KIAA proteins. In addition, we have updated the contents of the corresponding gene/protein characteristic tables in HUGE and have constructed two subsidiary databases, HUGEppi ( http://www. kazusa.or.jp/huge/ppi ) and ROUGE ( http://www. kazusa.or.jp/rouge ), to make available the results from our study of KIAA protein function. HUGEppi shows detailed information on protein–protein interactions detected between 84 pairs of KIAA proteins by yeast two‐hybrid screening. ROUGE summarizes the results of computer‐assisted analyses of ∼1000 mouse homologues of human large cDNAs that we identified. 
 The miRNA Registry provides a service for the assignment of miRNA gene names prior to publication. A comprehensive and searchable database of published miRNA sequences is accessible via a web interface ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/ ), and all sequence and annotation data are freely available for download. Release 2.0 of the database contains 506 miRNA entries from six organisms. 
 To provide the scientific community with a single, centralized, authoritative resource for protein sequences and functional information, the Swiss‐Prot, TrEMBL and PIR protein database activities have united to form the Universal Protein Knowledgebase (UniProt) consortium. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase, with extensive cross‐references and query interfaces. The central database will have two sections, corresponding to the familiar Swiss‐Prot (fully manually curated entries) and TrEMBL (enriched with automated classification, annotation and extensive cross‐references). For convenient sequence searches, UniProt also provides several non‐redundant sequence databases. The UniProt NREF (UniRef) databases provide representative subsets of the knowledgebase suitable for efficient searching. The comprehensive UniProt Archive (UniParc) is updated daily from many public source databases. The UniProt databases can be accessed online ( http://www.uniprot.org ) or downloaded in several formats (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub). The scientific community is encouraged to submit data for inclusion in UniProt. 
 DBTBS ( http://dbtbs.hgc.jp ) was originally released in 1999 as a reference database of published transcriptional regulation events in Bacillus subtilis , one of the best studied bacteria. It is essentially a compilation of transcription factors with their regulated genes as well as their recognition sequences, which were experimentally characterized and reported in the literature. Here we report its major update, which contains information on 114 transcription factors, including sigma factors, and 633 promoters of 525 genes. The number of references cited in the database has increased from 291 to 378. It also supports a function to find putative transcription factor binding sites within input sequences by using our collection of weight matrices and consensus patterns. Furthermore, though preliminarily, DBTBS now aims to contribute to comparative genomics by showing the presence or absence of potentially orthologous transcription factors and their corresponding cis ‐elements on the promoters of their potentially orthologously regulated genes in 50 eubacterial genomes. 
 The EyeSite is a web‐based database of protein families for proteins that function in the eye and their homologous sequences. The resource clusters proteins at different levels of homology in order to faciltate functional annotation of sequences and modelling of proteins from structural homologues. Eye proteins are organized into the tissue types in which they function and are clustered into homologous families using a novel protocol employing the TribeMCL algorithm. Homologous families are further subdivided into sequence clusters for which multiple sequence alignments are generated. Structural annotations from the CATH domain database are provided for nearly 90% of the sequences, and protein family annotations from the Pfam database for ∼86%. Homology models have also been generated where appropriate. The EyeSite is stored in a relational database and is extensively linked to other online bioinformatics resources to help relate allelic variants, annotations and clinical details to the derived data in the database. The EyeSite is available for online search, sequence information and model retrieval at http://eyesite.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/ . 
 The Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA) provides catalytic residue annotation for enzymes in the Protein Data Bank. It is available online at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton‐srv/databases/CSA . The database consists of two types of annotated site: an original hand‐annotated set containing information extracted from the primary literature, using defined criteria to assign catalytic residues, and an additional homologous set, containing annotations inferred by PSI‐BLAST and sequence alignment to one of the original set. The CSA can be queried via Swiss‐Prot identifier and EC number, as well as by PDB code. CSA Version 1.0 contains 177 original hand‐ annotated entries and 2608 homologous entries, and covers ∼30% of all EC numbers found in PDB. The CSA will be updated on a monthly basis to include homologous sites found in new PDBs, and new hand‐annotated enzymes as and when their annotatation is completed. 
 The Database of Interacting Proteins ( http://dip.doe‐mbi.ucla.edu ) aims to integrate the diverse body of experimental evidence on protein–protein interactions into a single, easily accessible online database. Because the reliability of experimental evidence varies widely, methods of quality assessment have been developed and utilized to identify the most reliable subset of the interactions. This CORE set can be used as a reference when evaluating the reliability of high‐throughput protein–protein interaction data sets, for development of prediction methods, as well as in the studies of the properties of protein interaction networks. 
 The Gene Expression Database (GXD) is a community resource for gene expression information in the laboratory mouse. By collecting and integrating different types of expression data, GXD provides information about expression profiles in different mouse strains and mutants. Participation in the Gene Ontology (GO) project classifies genes and gene products with regard to molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components. Integration with other Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) databases places the gene expression information in the context of mouse genetic, genomic and phenotypic information. The integration of these types of information enables valuable insights into the molecular biology that underlies development and disease. The utility of GXD has been improved by the daily addition of new data and through the implementation of new query and display features. These improvements make it easier for users to interrogate and visualize expression data in the context of their specific needs. GXD is accessible through the MGI website at http://www.informatics.jax.org/ or directly at http://www. informatics.jax.org/menus/expression_menu.shtml . 
 The analysis of regulatory regions in genome sequences is strongly based on the detection of potential transcription factor binding sites. The preferred models for representation of transcription factor binding specificity have been termed position‐specific scoring matrices. JASPAR is an open‐access database of annotated, high‐quality, matrix‐based transcription factor binding site profiles for multicellular eukaryotes. The profiles were derived exclusively from sets of nucleotide sequences experimentally demonstrated to bind transcription factors. The database is complemented by a web interface for browsing, searching and subset selection, an online sequence analysis utility and a suite of programming tools for genome‐wide and comparative genomic analysis of regulatory regions. JASPAR is available at http://jaspar. cgb.ki.se . 
 GenBank (R) is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available DNA sequences for more than 140 000 named organisms, obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large‐scale sequencing projects. Most submissions are made using the BankIt (web) or Sequin program and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank staff upon receipt. Daily data exchange with the EMBL Data Library in the UK and the DNA Data Bank of Japan helps ensure worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through NCBI’s retrieval system, Entrez, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. To access GenBank and its related retrieval and analysis services, go to the NCBI home page at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . 
 The MetaCyc database (see URL http://MetaCyc.org ) is a collection of metabolic pathways and enzymes from a wide variety of organisms, primarily microorganisms and plants. The goal of MetaCyc is to contain a representative sample of each experimentally elucidated pathway, and thereby to catalog the universe of metabolism. MetaCyc also describes reactions, chemical compounds and genes. Many of the pathways and enzymes in MetaCyc contain extensive information, including comments and literature citations. SRI’s Pathway Tools software supports querying, visualization and curation of MetaCyc. With its wide breadth and depth of metabolic information, MetaCyc is a valuable resource for a variety of applications. MetaCyc is the reference database of pathways and enzymes that is used in conjunction with SRI’s metabolic pathway prediction program to create Pathway/Genome Databases that can be augmented with curation from the scientific literature and published on the world wide web. MetaCyc also serves as a readily accessible comprehensive resource on microbial and plant pathways for genome analysis, basic research, education, metabolic engineering and systems biology. In the past 2 years the data content and the Pathway Tools software used to query, visualize and edit MetaCyc have been expanded significantly. These enhancements are described in this paper. 
 FusionDB ( http://igs‐server.cnrs‐mrs.fr/FusionDB/ ) constitutes a resource dedicated to in‐depth analysis of bacterial and archaeal gene fusion events. Such events can provide the ‘Rosetta stone’ in the search for potential protein–protein interactions, as well as metabolic and regulatory networks. However, the false positive rate of this approach may be quite high, prompting a detailed scrutiny of putative gene fusion events. FusionDB readily provides much of the information required for that task. Moreover, FusionDB extends the notion of gene fusion from that of a single gene to that of a family of genes by assembling pairs of genes from different genomes that belong to the same Cluster of Orthogonal Groups (COG). Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree reconstruction for the N‐ and C‐terminal parts of these ‘COG fusion’ events are provided to distinguish single and multiple fusion events from cases of gene fission, pseudogenes and other false positives. Finally, gene fusion events with matches to known structures of heterodimers in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are identified and may be visualized. FusionDB is fully searchable with access to sequence and alignment data at all levels. A number of different scores are provided to easily differentiate ‘real’ from ‘questionable’ cases, especially when larger database searches are performed. FusionDB is cross‐linked with the ‘Phylogenomic Display of Bacterial Genes’ (PhydBac) online web server. Together, these servers provide the complete set of information required for in‐depth analysis of non‐homology‐based gene function attribution. 
 As each newly sequenced genome contains a significant number of protein‐coding ORFs that are species‐, family‐ or lineage‐specific, many interesting questions arise about the evolution and role of these ORFs and of the genomes they are part of. We refer to these poorly conserved ORFs as singleton or paralogous ORFans if they are unique to one genome, or as orthologous ORFans if they appear only in a family of closely related organisms and have no homolog in other genomes. In order to study and classify ORFans we have constructed the ORFanage, an ORFan database. This database consists of the predicted ORFs in fully sequenced microbial genomes, and enables searching for the three types of ORFans in any subset of the genomes chosen by the user. The ORFanage could help in choosing interesting targets for further genomic and evolutionary studies. The ORFanage is accessible via http://www.bioinformatics.buffalo. edu/ORFanage . 
 RPG ( http://ribosome.miyazaki‐med.ac.jp/ ) is a new database that provides detailed information about ribosomal protein (RP) genes. It contains data from humans and other organisms, including Drosophilamelanogaster , Caenorhabditiselegans , Saccharo mycescerevisiae , Methanococcus jannaschii and Escherichia coli . Users can search the database by gene name and organism. Each record includes sequences (genomic, cDNA and amino acid sequences), intron/exon structures, genomic locations and information about orthologs. In addition, users can view and compare the gene structures of the above organisms and make multiple amino acid sequence alignments. RPG also provides information on small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that are encoded in the introns of RP genes. 
 The α/β‐hydrolase fold is characterized by a β‐sheet core of five to eight strands connected by α‐helices to form a α/β/α sandwich. In most of the family members the β‐strands are parallels, but some show an inversion in the order of the first strands, resulting in antiparallel orientation. The members of the superfamily diverged from a common ancestor into a number of hydrolytic enzymes with a wide range of substrate specificities, together with other proteins with no recognized catalytic activity. In the enzymes the catalytic triad residues are presented on loops, of which one, the nucleophile elbow, is the most conserved feature of the fold. Of the other proteins, which all lack from one to all of the catalytic residues, some may simply be ‘inactive’ enzymes while others are known to be involved in surface recognition functions. The ESTHER database ( http://bioweb.ensam.inra.fr/esther ) gathers and annotates all the published information related to gene and protein sequences of this superfamily, as well as biochemical, pharmacological and structural data, and connects them so as to provide the bases for studying structure–function relationships within the family. The most recent developments of the database, which include a section on human diseases related to members of the family, are described. 
 We established a database of alternative splice forms (ASforms) for nine eukaryotic organisms. ASforms are defined by comparing high‐scoring ESTs with mRNA sequences using BLAST, taking known exon–intron information (from the Ensembl database). Filtering programs compare the ends of each aligned sequence pair for deletions or insertions in the EST sequence, which indicate the existence of alternative splice forms with respect to the exon–intron boundaries. Moreover, we defined the alternative splice profile of each human sequence. It indicates the number of alternatively spliced ESTs (NAE), the number of constitutively spliced ESTs (NCE) as well as the number of alternative splice sites (NSS) per mRNA. NAE and NCE correspond to the EST coverage and can be used as a quality indicator for the predicted alternative splice variants. The NSS value specifies the splice propensity of a gene. Additionally, the tissue type information of all ESTs was included. This allows (i) restriction of the search to certain tissues and (ii) calculation of the tissue‐NAEs, tissue‐NCEs and tissue‐NSS. These scores are suitable for the estimation of tissue specificity of certain ASforms. Furthermore, the developmental stage and disease information of the ESTs is available. EASED is accessible at http://eased.bioinf.mdc‐berlin.de/ . 
 In addition to maintaining the GenBank(R) nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides data analysis and retrieval resources for the data in GenBank and other biological data made available through NCBI’s website. NCBI resources include Entrez, PubMed, PubMed Central, LocusLink, the NCBI Taxonomy Browser, BLAST, BLAST Link (BLink), Electronic PCR, OrfFinder, Spidey, RefSeq, UniGene, HomoloGene, ProtEST, dbMHC, dbSNP, Cancer Chromosome Aberration Project (CCAP), Entrez Genomes and related tools, the Map Viewer, Model Maker, Evidence Viewer, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database, Retroviral Genotyping Tools, SARS Coronavirus Resource, SAGEmap, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) and the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART). Augmenting many of the web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets. All of the resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . 
 Essential genes are genes that are indispensable to support cellular life. These genes constitute a minimal gene set required for a living cell. We have constructed a Database of Essential Genes (DEG), which contains all the essential genes that are currently available. The functions encoded by essential genes are considered a foundation of life and therefore are likely to be common to all cells. Users can BLAST the query sequences against DEG. If homologous genes are found, it is possible that the queried genes are also essential. Users can search for essential genes by their function or name. Users can also browse and extract all the records in DEG. Essential gene products comprise excellent targets for antibacterial drugs. Analysis of essential genes could help to answer the question of what are the basic functions necessary to support cellular life. DEG is freely accessible from the website http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg/ . 
 Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important components of the innate immune system of many species. These peptides are found in eukaryotes, including mammals, amphibians, insects and plants, as well as in prokaryotes. Other than having pathogen‐lytic properties, these peptides have other activities like antitumor activity, mitogen activity, or they may act as signaling molecules. Their short length, fast and efficient action against microbes and low toxicity to mammals have made them potential candidates as peptide drugs. In many cases they are effective against pathogens that are resistant to conventional antibiotics. They can serve as natural templates for the design of novel antimicrobial drugs. Although there are vast amounts of data on natural AMPs, they are not available through one central resource. We have developed a comprehensive database (ANTIMIC, http://research.i2r. a‐star.edu.sg/Templar/DB/ANTIMIC/ ) of known and putative AMPs, which contains ∼1700 of these peptides. The database is integrated with tools to facilitate efficient extraction of data and their analysis at molecular level, as well as search for new AMPs. These tools include BLAST, PDB structure viewer and the Antimic profile module. 
 The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/ ), maintained at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), incorporates, organizes and distributes nucleotide sequences from public sources. The database is a part of an international collaboration with DDBJ (Japan) and GenBank (USA). Data are exchanged between the collaborating databases on a daily basis to achieve optimal synchrony. The web‐based tool, Webin, is the preferred system for individual submission of nucleotide sequences, including Third Party Annotation (TPA) and alignment data. Automatic submission procedures are used for submission of data from large‐scale genome sequencing centres and from the European Patent Office. Database releases are produced quarterly. The latest data collection can be accessed via FTP, email and WWW interfaces. The EBI’s Sequence Retrieval System (SRS) integrates and links the main nucleotide and protein databases as well as many other specialist molecular biology databases. For sequence similarity searching, a variety of tools (e.g. FASTA and BLAST) are available that allow external users to compare their own sequences against the data in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database, the complete genomic component subsection of the database, the WGS data sets and other databases. All available resources can be accessed via the EBI home page at http://www.ebi.ac.uk . 
 The European ribosomal RNA database aims to compile all complete or nearly complete ribosomal RNA sequences from both the small (SSU) and large (LSU) ribosomal subunits. All sequences are available in aligned format. Sequence alignment is based on the secondary structure of the molecules, as determined by comparative sequence analysis. Additional information about the sequences, such as taxonomic classification of the organism from which they have been obtained, and literature references are also provided. In order to identify the closest relatives to newly determined sequences, BLAST searches can be performed, after which the best matching sequences are aligned and a phylogenetic tree is inferred. As of 2003, the European ribosomal RNA database is maintained at Ghent University (Belgium). The database can be consulted at http://www.psb.ugent.be/rRNA/ . 
 TcruziDB ( http://TcruziDB.org ) is an integrated genome database for the parasitic organism Trypanosoma cruzi , the causative agent of Chagas’ disease. The database currently incorporates all available sequence data (Genomic, BAC, EST) in a single user‐friendly location. The database contains a variety of tools specifically designed for searching unannotated draft sequence via BLAST, keyword searches of pre‐computed BLAST results, and protein motif searches. Release 1.0 of the database contains nearly 730 million bp of genome sequence from 1.1 million sequence reads generated by the TIGR–Karolinska–SBRI Trypanosoma cruzi Genome Consortium and 15 million bp of clustered EST and genomic sequence obtained from other sources. As annotation, microarray and proteomic data become available, the database will incorporate and integrate these data using the GUS ( http://www.gusdb. org ) relational framework. 
 The SWISS‐MODEL Repository is a database of annotated three‐dimensional comparative protein structure models generated by the fully automated homology‐modelling pipeline SWISS‐MODEL. The Repository currently contains about 300 000 three‐dimensional models for sequences from the Swiss‐Prot and TrEMBL databases. The content of the Repository is updated on a regular basis incorporating new sequences, taking advantage of new template structures becoming available and reflecting improvements in the underlying modelling algorithms. Each entry consists of one or more three‐dimensional protein models, the superposed template structures, the alignments on which the models are based, a summary of the modelling process and a force field based quality assessment. The SWISS‐MODEL Repository can be queried via an interactive website at http://swissmodel.expasy. org/repository/ . Annotation and cross‐linking of the models with other databases, e.g. Swiss‐Prot on the ExPASy server, allow for seamless navigation between protein sequence and structure information. The aim of the SWISS‐MODEL Repository is to provide access to an up‐to‐date collection of annotated three‐dimensional protein models generated by automated homology modelling, bridging the gap between sequence and structure databases. 
 C A DRE is a public resource for housing and analysing genomic data extracted from species of Aspergillus . It arose to enable maintenance of the complete annotated genomic sequence of Aspergillus fumigatus and to provide tools for searching, analysing and visualizing features of fungal genomes. By implementing C A DRE using Ensembl, a framework is in place for storing and comparing several genomes: the resource will thus expand by including other Aspergillus genomes (such as Aspergillus nidulans ) as they become available. C A DRE is accessible at http://www.cadre. man.ac.uk . 
 MitoProteome is an object‐relational mitochondrial protein sequence database and annotation system. The initial release contains 847 human mitochondrial protein sequences, derived from public sequence databases and mass spectrometric analysis of highly purified human heart mitochondria. Each sequence is manually annotated with primary function, subfunction and subcellular location, and extensively annotated in an automated process with data extracted from external databases, including gene information from LocusLink and Ensembl; disease information from OMIM; protein–protein interaction data from MINT and DIP; functional domain information from Pfam; protein fingerprints from PRINTS; protein family and family‐specific signatures from InterPro; structure data from PDB; mutation data from PMD; BLAST homology data from NCBI NR; and proteins found to be related based on LocusLink and SWISS‐PROT references and sequence and taxonomy data. By highly automating the processes of maintaining the MitoProteome Protein List and extracting relevant data from external databases, we are able to present a dynamic database, updated frequently to reflect changes in public resources. The MitoProteome database is publicly available at http://www. mitoproteome.org/ . Users may browse and search MitoProteome, and access a complete compilation of data relevant to each protein of interest, cross‐linked to external databases. 
 Pfam is a large collection of protein families and domains. Over the past 2 years the number of families in Pfam has doubled and now stands at 6190 (version 10.0). Methodology improvements for searching the Pfam collection locally as well as via the web are described. Other recent innovations include modelling of discontinuous domains allowing Pfam domain definitions to be closer to those found in structure databases. Pfam is available on the web in the UK ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/ ), the USA ( http://pfam.wustl.edu/ ), France ( http://pfam.jouy.inra.fr/ ) and Sweden ( http://Pfam.cgb.ki.se/ ). 
 The 3D‐GENOMICS database ( http://www.sbg.bio. ic.ac.uk/3dgenomics/ ) provides structural annotations for proteins from sequenced genomes. In August 2003 the database included data for 93 proteomes. The annotations stored in the database include homologous sequences from various sequence databases, domains from SCOP and Pfam, patterns from Prosite and other predicted sequence features such as transmembrane regions and coiled coils. In addition to annotations at the sequence level, several precomputed cross‐ proteome comparative analyses are available based on SCOP domain superfamily composition. Annotations are available to the user via a web interface to the database. Multiple points of entry are available so that a user is able to: (i) directly access annotations for a single protein sequence via keywords or accession codes, (ii) examine a sequence of interest chosen from a summary of annotations for a particular proteome, or (iii) access precomputed frequency‐based cross‐proteome comparative analyses. 
 The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; http://www.yeastgenome.org/ ), a scientific database of the molecular biology and genetics of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , has recently developed several new resources that allow the comparison and integration of information on a genome‐wide scale, enabling the user not only to find detailed information about individual genes, but also to make connections across groups of genes with common features and across different species. The Fungal Alignment Viewer displays alignments of sequences from multiple fungal genomes, while the Sequence Similarity Query tool displays PSI‐BLAST alignments of each S.cerevisiae protein with similar proteins from any species whose sequences are contained in the non‐redundant (nr) protein data set at NCBI. The Yeast Biochemical Pathways tool integrates groups of genes by their common roles in metabolism and displays the metabolic pathways in a graphical form. Finally, the Find Chromosomal Features search interface provides a versatile tool for querying multiple types of information in SGD. 
 An antimicrobial peptide database (APD) has been established based on an extensive literature search. It contains detailed information for 525 peptides (498 antibacterial, 155 antifungal, 28 antiviral and 18 antitumor). APD provides interactive interfaces for peptide query, prediction and design. It also provides statistical data for a select group of or all the peptides in the database. Peptide information can be searched using keywords such as peptide name, ID, length, net charge, hydrophobic percentage, key residue, unique sequence motif, structure and activity. APD is a useful tool for studying the structure–function relationship of antimicrobial peptides. The database can be accessed via a web‐based browser at the URL: http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/main.html . 
 The aim of the MitoP2 database ( http://ihg.gsf.de/mitop2 ) is to provide a comprehensive list of mitochondrial proteins of yeast and man. Based on the current literature we created an annotated reference set of yeast and human proteins. In addition, data sets relevant to the study of the mitochondrial proteome are integrated and accessible via search tools and links. They include computational predictions of signalling sequences, and summarize results from proteome mapping, mutant screening, expression profiling, protein–protein interaction and cellular sublocalization studies. For each individual approach, specificity and sensitivity for allocating mitochondrial proteins was calculated. By providing the evidence for mitochondrial candidate proteins the MitoP2 database lends itself to the genetic characterization of human mitochondriopathies. 
 Genew, the Human Gene Nomenclature Database http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi‐bin/nomenclature/searchgenes.pl is the only resource that provides data for all human genes that have approved symbols. It is managed by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) as a confidential database, containing over 22 000 records, 75% of which are represented online by a publicly searchable text file. Since 2002, there have been significant improvements to the Genew search engine. Additionally we have increased our capacity to analyse confidential sequence data, which has enabled us to manage the large numbers of gene symbol requests that we receive from the chromosome sequencing consortia. 
 The SNP500Cancer Database provides sequence and genotype assay information for candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) useful in mapping complex diseases, such as cancer. The database is an integral component of the NCI’s Cancer Genome Anatomy Project. SNP500Cancer provides bi‐directional sequencing information on a set of control DNA samples derived from anonymized subjects (102 Coriell samples representing four self‐described ethnic groups: African/African‐American, Caucasian, Hispanic and Pacific Rim). All SNPs are chosen from public databases and reports, and the choice of genes includes a bias towards non‐synonymous and promoter SNPs in genes that have been implicated in one or more cancers. The web site is searchable by gene, chromosome, gene ontology pathway and by known dbSNP ID. As of July 2003, the database contains over 3400 SNPs, 2490 of which have been sequenced in the SNP500Cancer population. For each analyzed SNP, gene location and over 200 bp of surrounding annotated sequence (including nearby SNPs) are provided, with frequency information in total and per subpopulation, and calculation of Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) for each subpopulation. Sequence validated SNPs with minor allele frequency > 5% are entered into a high‐throughput pipeline for genotyping analysis to determine concordance for the same 102 samples. The website provides the conditions for validated genotyping assays. SNP500Cancer provides an invaluable resource for investigators to select SNPs for analysis, design genotyping assays using validated sequence data, choose selected assays already validated on one or more genotyping platforms, and select reference standards for genotyping assays. The SNP500Cancer Database is freely accessible via the web page at http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov/ . 
 RegulonDB is the primary database of the major international maintained curation of original literature with experimental knowledge about the elements and interactions of the network of transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli K‐12. This includes mechanistic information about operon organization and their decomposition into transcription units (TUs), promoters and their σ type, binding sites of specific transcriptional regulators (TRs), their organization into ‘regulatory phrases’, active and inactive conformations of TRs, as well as terminators and ribosome binding sites. The database is complemented with clearly marked computational predictions of TUs, promoters and binding sites of TRs. The current version has been expanded to include information beyond specific mechanisms aimed at gathering different growth conditions and the associated induced and/or repressed genes. RegulonDB is now linked with Swiss‐Prot, with microarray databases, and with a suite of programs to analyze and visualize microarray experiments. We provide a summary of the biological knowledge contained in RegulonDB and describe the major changes in the design of the database. RegulonDB can be accessed on the web at the URL: http://www.cifn.unam.mx/Computational_Biology/regulondb/ . 
 IntAct provides an open source database and toolkit for the storage, presentation and analysis of protein interactions. The web interface provides both textual and graphical representations of protein interactions, and allows exploring interaction networks in the context of the GO annotations of the interacting proteins. A web service allows direct computational access to retrieve interaction networks in XML format. IntAct currently contains ∼2200 binary and complex interactions imported from the literature and curated in collaboration with the Swiss‐Prot team, making intensive use of controlled vocabularies to ensure data consistency. All IntAct software, data and controlled vocabularies are available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact . 
 The SUPERFAMILY database provides structural assignments to protein sequences and a framework for analysis of the results. At the core of the database is a library of profile Hidden Markov Models that represent all proteins of known structure. The library is based on the SCOP classification of proteins: each model corresponds to a SCOP domain and aims to represent an entire superfamily. We have applied the library to predicted proteins from all completely sequenced genomes (currently 154), the Swiss‐Prot and TrEMBL databases and other sequence collections. Close to 60% of all proteins have at least one match, and one half of all residues are covered by assignments. All models and full results are available for download and online browsing at http://supfam.org . Users can study the distribution of their superfamily of interest across all completely sequenced genomes, investigate with which other superfamilies it combines and retrieve proteins in which it occurs. Alternatively, concentrating on a particular genome as a whole, it is possible first, to find out its superfamily composition, and secondly, to compare it with that of other genomes to detect superfamilies that are over‐ or under‐represented. In addition, the webserver provides the following standard services: sequence search; keyword search for genomes, superfamilies and sequence identifiers; and multiple alignment of genomic, PDB and custom sequences. 
 The PROSITE database consists of a large collection of biologically meaningful signatures that are described as patterns or profiles. Each signature is linked to documentation that provides useful biological information on the protein family, domain or functional site identified by the signature. The PROSITE web page has been redesigned and several tools have been implemented to help the user discover new conserved regions in their own proteins and to visualize domain arrangements. We also introduced the facility to search PDB with a PROSITE entry or a user’s pattern and visualize matched positions on 3D structures. The latest version of PROSITE (release 18.17 of November 30, 2003) contains 1676 entries. The database is accessible at http://www.expasy.org/prosite/ . 
 TrSDB—TranScout Database—( http://ibb.uab.es/trsdb ) is a proteome database of eukaryotic transcription factors based upon predicted motifs by TranScout and data sources such as InterPro and Gene Ontology Annotation. Nine eukaryotic proteomes are included in the current version. Extensive and diverse information for each database entry, different analyses considering TranScout classification and similarity relationships are offered for research on transcription factors or gene expression. 
 Retroviral insertional mutagenesis in mouse hematopoietic tumors provides a potent cancer gene discovery tool in the post‐genome‐sequence era. To manage multiple high‐throughput insertional mutagenesis screening projects, we developed the Retroviral Tagged Cancer Gene Database (RTCGD; http://RTCGD.ncifcrf.gov ). A sequence analysis pipeline determines the genomic position of each retroviral integration site cloned from a mouse tumor, the distance between it and the nearest candidate disease gene(s) and its orientation with respect to the candidate gene(s). The pipeline also identifies genomic regions that are targets of retroviral integration in more than one tumor (common integration sites, CISs) and are thus likely to encode a disease gene. Users can search the database using a specified gene symbol, chromosome number or tumor model to identify both CIS genes and unique viral integration sites or compare the integration sites cloned by different laboratories using different models. As a default setting, users first review the CIS Lists and then Clone Lists. CIS Lists describe CISs and their candidate disease genes along with links to other public databases and clone lists. Clone Lists describe the viral integration site clones along with the tumor model and tumor type from which they were cloned, candidate disease gene(s), genomic position and orientation of the integrated provirus with respect to the candidate gene(s). It also provides a pictorial view of the genomic location of each integration site relative to neighboring genes and markers. Researchers can identify integrations of interest and compare their results with those for multiple tumor models and tumor types using RTCGD. 
 Using more than one approach to characterizing functions of unknown proteins, we now present in GenProtEC ( http://genprotec.mbl.edu/ ) some level of function information for 87% of Escherichia coli K‐12 proteins. A new approach that has yielded new information entails assigning content of structural domains and their functions to E.coli proteins. In addition, some earlier methods have been further refined to provide more meaningful data. The process of identifying and separating multimodular or fused proteins into component modules has been improved. As a result, groups of sequence‐similar (paralogous) proteins have been refined. Experimental information from recent literature on previously unknown genes has been incorporated. We now use a rich system of characterizing cell roles which accents the fact that many proteins play more than one cellular role and therefore carry more than one designation from our detailed catalog of roles, MultiFun. 
Arabidopsis thaliana is the most widely studied model plant. Functional genomics is intensively underway in many laboratories worldwide. Beyond the basic annotation of the primary sequence data, the annotated genetic elements of Arabidopsis must be linked to diverse biological data and higher order information such as metabolic or regulatory pathways. The MIPS Arabidopsis thaliana database MAtDB aims to provide a comprehensive resource for Arabidopsis as a genome model that serves as a primary reference for research in plants and is suitable for transfer of knowledge to other plants, especially crops. The genome sequence as a common backbone serves as a scaffold for the integration of data, while, in a complementary effort, these data are enhanced through the application of state‐of‐the‐art bioinformatics tools. This information is visualized on a genome‐wide and a gene‐by‐gene basis with access both for web users and applications. This report updates the information given in a previous report and provides an outlook on further developments. The MAtDB web interface can be accessed at http://mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db . 
 High‐throughput instruments were recently developed to determine gene expression patterns on tissue sections by RNA in situ hybridization. The resulting images of gene expression patterns, chiefly of E14.5 mouse embryos, are accessible to the public at http://www.genepaint.org . This relational database is searchable for gene identifiers and RNA probe sequences. Moreover, patterns and intensity of expression in ∼100 different embryonic tissues are annotated and can be searched using a standardized catalog of anatomical structures. A virtual microscope tool, the Zoom Image Server, was implemented in GenePaint.org and permits interactive zooming and panning across ∼15 000 high‐resolution images. 
 The Génolevures online database ( http://cbi.labri.fr/Genolevures/ ) provides data and tools to facilitate comparative genomic studies on hemiascomycetous yeasts. Now, four complete genome sequences recently determined ( Candida glabrata , Kluyveromyces lactis , Debaryomyces hansenii , Yarrowia lipolytica ) have been added to the partial sequences of 13 species previously analysed by a random approach. The database also includes the reference genome Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Data are presented with a focus on relations between genes and genomes: conservation of genes and gene families, speciation, chromosomal reorganization and synteny. The Génolevures site includes a community area for specific studies by members of the international community. 
 The Molecular Biology Database Collection is a public resource listing key databases of value to the biologist, including those featured in this issue of Nucleic Acids Research , and other high‐quality databases. All databases included in this Collection are freely available to the public. This listing aims to serve as a convenient starting point for searching the web for reliable information on various aspects of molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics. This year’s update includes 548 databases, 162 more than the previous one. The databases are organized in a hierarchical classification that should simplify finding the right database for each given task. Each database in the list comes with a recently updated brief description. The database list and the database descriptions can be accessed online at the Nucleic Acids Research web site http://nar. oupjournals.org/ . 
HbVar ( http://globin.cse.psu.edu/globin/hbvar/ ) is a relational database developed by a multi‐center academic effort to provide up‐to‐date and high quality information on the genomic sequence changes leading to hemoglobin variants and all types of thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies. Extensive information is recorded for each variant and mutation, including sequence alterations, biochemical and hematological effects, associated pathology, ethnic occurrence and references. In addition to the regular updates to entries, we report two significant advances: (i) The frequencies for a large number of mutations causing β‐thalassemia in at‐risk populations have been extracted from the published literature and made available for the user to query upon. (ii) HbVar has been linked with the GALA (Genome Alignment and Annotation database, available at http://globin.cse.psu.edu/gala/ ) so that users can combine information on hemoglobin variants and thalassemia mutations with a wide spectrum of genomic data. It also expands the capacity to view and analyze the data, using tools within GALA and the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. 
 Bacteria belonging to the class Mollicutes were among the first ones to be selected for complete genome sequencing because of the minimal size of their genomes and their pathogenicity for humans and a broad range of animals and plants. At this time six genome sequences have been publicly released ( Mycoplasma genitalium , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Ureaplasma urealyticum‐parvum , Mycoplasma pulmonis , Mycoplasma penetrans and Mycoplasma gallisepticum ) and as the number of available mollicute genomes increases, comparative genomics analysis within this model group of organisms becomes more and more instructive. However, such an analysis is difficult to carry out without a suitable platform gathering not only the original annotations but also relevant information available in public databases or obtained by applying common bioinformatics methods. With the aim of solving these difficulties, we have developed a web‐accessible database named MolliGen ( http://cbi.labri.fr/outils/molligen/ ). After selecting a set of genomes the user can launch various types of search based on annotation, position on the chromosomes or sequence similarity. In addition, relationships of putative orthology have been precomputed to allow differential genome queries. The results are presented in table format with multiple links to public databases and to bioinformatic analyses such as multiple alignments or BLAST search. Specific tools were also developed for the graphical visualization of the results, including a multi‐ genome browser for displaying dynamic pictures with clickable objects and for viewing relationships of precomputed similarity. MolliGen is designed to integrate all the complete genomes of mollicutes as they become available. 
 Xpro is a relational database that contains all the eukaryotic protein‐encoding DNA sequences contained in GenBank with associated data required for the analysis of eukaryotic gene architecture. In addition to the information found in the GenBank records, which includes properties such as sequence, position, length and description about introns, exons and protein‐coding regions, Xpro provides annotations on the splice sites and intron phases. Furthermore, Xpro validates intron positions using alignment information between the record’s sequence and EST sequences found in dbEST. In the process of validation, alternative splicing information is also obtained and can be found in the database. The intron‐containing genes in the Xpro are also classified as experimental or predicted based on the intron position validation and specific keywords in the GenBank records that are present in predicted genes. An Entrez‐like query system, which is familiar to most biologists, is provided for accessing the information present in the database system. A non‐redundant set of Xpro database contents is also obtained by cross‐referencing to the Swiss‐Prot/TrEMBL and Pfam databases. The database currently contains information for 493 983 genes—351 918 intron‐ containing genes and 142 065 intron‐less genes. Xpro is updated for each new GenBank release and is freely available via the internet at http://origin.bic. nus.edu.sg/xpro . 
 tmRNA combines tRNA‐ and mRNA‐like properties and ameliorates problems arising from stalled ribosomes. Research on the mechanism, structure and biology of tmRNA is served by the tmRNA website ( http://www.indiana.edu/∼tmrna ), a collection of sequences, alignments, secondary structures and other information. Because many of these sequences are not in GenBank, a BLAST server has been added; another new feature is an abbreviated alignment for the tRNA‐like domain only. Many tmRNA sequences from plastids have been added, five found in public sequence data and another 10 generated by direct sequencing; detection in early‐branching members of the green plastid lineage brings coverage to all three primary plastid lineages. The new sequences include the shortest known tmRNA sequence. While bacterial tmRNAs usually have a lone pseudoknot upstream of the mRNA segment and a string of three or four pseudoknots downstream, plastid tmRNAs collectively show loss of pseudoknots at both postions. The pseudoknot‐string region is also too short to contain the usual pseudoknot number in another new entry, the tmRNA sequence from a bacterial endosymbiont of insect cells, Tremblaya princeps . Pseudoknots may optimize tmRNA function in free‐living bacteria, yet become dispensible when the endosymbiotic lifestyle relaxes selective pressure for fast growth. 
 Proteins can be formed by single or multiple domains. The process of recombination at the molecular level has generated a wide variety of multi‐domain proteins with specific domain organization to cater to the functional requirements of an organism. The functional and structural costs of inserting a domain into another means that multi‐domain proteins are usually formed by covalently linking the N‐terminus of one domain to the C‐terminus of the preceding domain. While this is true in a large proportion of multi‐domain proteins, we find a significant fraction of proteins that are the result of domain insertion. The inserted domain breaks the sequence contiguity of the domain into which it is inserted leading to a novel domain organization. This web resource aims to document domain insertions in known protein structures that are classified in the SCOP database. The web server can be accessed from http://stash.mrc‐lmb.cam. ac.uk/DomIns/ . 
 Nematode.net ( www.nematode.net ) is a web‐ accessible resource for investigating gene sequences from nematode genomes. The database is an outgrowth of the parasitic nematode EST project at Washington University’s Genome Sequencing Center (GSC), St Louis. A sister project at the University of Edinburgh and the Sanger Institute is also underway. More than 295 000 ESTs have been generated from >30 nematodes other than Caenorhabditis elegans including key parasites of humans, animals and plants. Nematode.net currently provides NemaGene EST cluster consensus sequence, enhanced online BLAST search tools, functional classifications of cluster sequences and comprehensive information concerning the ongoing generation of nematode genome data. The long‐term goal of nematode.net is to provide the scientific community with the highest quality sequence information and tools for studying these diverse species. 
 The ACLAME database ( http://aclame.ulb.ac.be ) is a collection and classification of prokaryotic mobile genetic elements (MGEs) from various sources, comprising all known phage genomes, plasmids and transposons. In addition to providing information on the full genomes and genetic entities, it aims to build a comprehensive classification of the functional modules of MGEs at the protein, gene and higher levels. This first version contains a comprehensive classification of 5069 proteins from 119 DNA bacteriophages into over 400 functional families. This classification was produced automatically using TRIBE‐MCL, a graph‐theory‐based Markov clustering algorithm that uses sequence measures as input, and then manually curated. Manual curation was aided by consulting annotations available in public databases retrieved through additional sequence similarity searches using Psi‐Blast and Hidden Markov Models. The database is publicly accessible and open to expert volunteers willing to participate in its curation. Its web interface allows browsing as well as querying the classification. The main objectives are to collect and organize in a rational way the complexity inherent to MGEs, to extend and improve the inadequate annotation currently associated with MGEs and to screen known genomes for the validation and discovery of new MGEs. 
Dictyostelium discoideum is a powerful and genetically tractable model system used for the study of numerous cellular molecular mechanisms including chemotaxis, phagocytosis and signal transduction. The past 2 years have seen a significant expansion in the scope and accessibility of online resources for Dictyostelium . Recent advances have focused on the development of a new comprehensive online resource called dictyBase ( http://dictybase.org ). This database not only provides access to genomic data including functional annotation of genes, gene products and chromosomal mapping, but also to extensive biological information such as mutant phenotypes and corresponding reference material. In conjunction with additional sites ( http://genome. imb‐jena.de/dictyostelium/ , http://dictyensembl. bioch.bcm.tmc.edu and http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_discoideum/ ) from the genome sequencing and assembly centers, these improvements have expanded the scope of the Dictyostelium databases making them accessible and useful to any researcher interested in comparative and functional genomics in metazoan organisms. 
 The Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS‐GSF), Neuherberg, Germany, provides protein sequence‐related information based on whole‐genome analysis. The main focus of the work is directed toward the systematic organization of sequence‐related attributes as gathered by a variety of algorithms, primary information from experimental data together with information compiled from the scientific literature. MIPS maintains automatically generated and manually annotated genome‐specific databases, develops systematic classification schemes for the functional annotation of protein sequences and provides tools for the comprehensive analysis of protein sequences. This report updates the information on the yeast genome (CYGD), the Neurospora crassa genome (MNCDB), the database of complete cDNAs (German Human Genome Project, NGFN), the database of mammalian protein–protein interactions (MPPI), the database of FASTA homologies (SIMAP), and the interface for the fast retrieval of protein‐associated information (QUIPOS). The Arabidopsis thaliana database, the rice database, the plant EST databases (MATDB, MOsDB, SPUTNIK), as well as the databases for the comprehensive set of genomes (PEDANT genomes) are described elsewhere in the 2003 and 2004 NAR database issues, respectively. All databases described, and the detailed descriptions of our projects can be accessed through the MIPS web server ( http://mips.gsf.de ). 
 The ORFDB ( http://orf.invitrogen.com/ ) represents an ongoing effort at Invitrogen Corporation to integrate relevant scientific data with an evolving collection of human and mouse Open Reading Frame (ORF) clones (Ultimate™ ORF Clones). The ORFDB serves as a central data warehouse enabling researchers to search the ORF collection through its web portal ORFBrowser, allowing researchers to find the Ultimate™ ORF clones by blast, keyword, GenBank accession, gene symbol, clone ID, Unigene ID, LocusLink ID or through functional relationships by browsing the collection via the Gene Ontology (GO) Browser. As of October 2003, the ORFDB contains 6200 human and 2870 mouse Ultimate™ ORF clones. All Ultimate™ ORF clones have been fully sequenced with high quality, and are matched to public reference protein sequences. In addition, the cloned ORFs have been extensively annotated across six categories: Gene, ORF, Clone Format, Protein, SNP and Genomic links, with the information assembled in a format termed the ORFCard. The ORFCard represents an information repository that documents the sequence quality, alignment with respect to public protein sequences, and the latest publicly available information associated with each human and mouse gene represented in the collection. 
We previously introduced two new protein databases (trEST and trGEN) of hypothetical protein sequences predicted from EST and HTG sequences, respectively. Here, we present the updates made on these two databases plus a new database (trome), which uses alignments of EST data to HTG or full genomes to generate virtual transcripts and coding sequences. This new database is of higher quality and since it contains the information in a much denser format it is of much smaller size. These new databases are in a Swiss‐Prot‐like format and are updated on a weekly basis (trEST and trGEN) or every 3 months (trome). They can be downloaded by anonymous ftp from ftp://ftp.isrec.isb‐sib.ch/pub/databases.
 The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) is an annotated non‐redundant collection of eukaryotic POL II promoters, experimentally defined by a transcription start site (TSS). There may be multiple promoter entries for a single gene. The underlying experimental evidence comes from journal articles and, starting from release 73, from 5′ ESTs of full‐length cDNA clones used for so‐called in silico primer extension. Access to promoter sequences is provided by pointers to TSS positions in nucleotide sequence entries. The annotation part of an EPD entry includes a description of the type and source of the initiation site mapping data, links to other biological databases and bibliographic references. EPD is structured in a way that facilitates dynamic extraction of biologically meaningful promoter subsets for comparative sequence analysis. Web‐based interfaces have been developed that enable the user to view EPD entries in different formats, to select and extract promoter sequences according to a variety of criteria and to navigate to related databases exploiting different cross‐references. Tools for analysing sequence motifs around TSSs defined in EPD are provided by the signal search analysis server. EPD can be accessed at http://www.epd. isb‐sib.ch . 
 SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) is a web tool ( http://smart.embl.de/ ) for the identification and annotation of protein domains, and provides a platform for the comparative study of complex domain architectures in genes and proteins. The January 2004 release of SMART contains 685 protein domains. New developments in SMART are centred on the integration of data from completed metazoan genomes. SMART now uses predicted proteins from complete genomes in its source sequence databases, and integrates these with predictions of orthology. New visualization tools have been developed to allow analysis of gene intron–exon structure within the context of protein domain structure, and to align these displays to provide schematic comparisons of orthologous genes, or multiple transcripts from the same gene. Other improvements include the ability to query SMART by Gene Ontology terms, improved structure database searching and batch retrieval of multiple entries. 
 Alternative splicing is widespread in mammalian gene expression, and variant splice patterns are often specific to different stages of development, particular tissues or a disease state. There is a need to systematically collect data on alternatively spliced exons, introns and splice isoforms, and to annotate this data. The Alternative Splicing Database consortium has been addressing this need, and is committed to maintaining and developing a value‐added database of alternative splice events, and of experimentally verified regulatory mechanisms that mediate splice variants. In this paper we present two of the products from this project: namely, a database of computationally delineated alternative splice events as seen in alignments of EST/cDNA sequences with genome sequences, and a database of alternatively spliced exons collected from literature. The reported splice events are from nine different organisms and are annotated for various biological features including expression states and cross‐species conservation. The data are presented on our ASD web pages ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/asd ). 
 DSDBASE is a database of disulphide bonds in proteins, which provides information on native disulphides and those that are stereochemically possible between pairs of residues for all known protein structural entries. The modelling of disulphides has been performed, using MODIP, by the identification of residue pairs that can strainlessly accommodate a covalent cross‐link. We also assess the stereochemical quality of the covalent cross‐link and grade them appropriately. One of the potential uses of the database is to design site‐directed mutants in order to enhance the thermal stability of a protein. The proposed sites of mutations can be viewed specifically with respect to active sites of enzymes and across physiological dimers. The occurrence of native and modelled disulphides increases the dimensions of the database enormously. This database can also be employed for proposing three‐dimensional models of disulphide‐rich short polypeptides. The database can be accessed from http://www.ncbs.res.in/∼faculty/mini/dsdbase/dsdbase.html . Supplementary information can be accessed from http://www.ncbs.res.in/ ∼faculty/mini/dsdbase/nar/suppl.htm . 
 Peptidases (proteolytic enzymes) are of great relevance to biology, medicine and biotechnology. This practical importance creates a need for an integrated source of information about them, and also about their natural inhibitors. The MEROPS database ( http://merops.sanger.ac.uk ) aims to fill this need. The organizational principle of the database is a hierarchical classification in which homologous sets of the proteins of interest are grouped in families and the homologous families are grouped in clans. Each peptidase, family and clan has a unique identifier. The database has recently been expanded to include the protein inhibitors of peptidases, and these are classified in much the same way as the peptidases. Forms of information recently added include new links to other databases, summary alignments for peptidase clans, displays to show the distribution of peptidases and inhibitors among organisms, substrate cleavage sites and indexes for expressed sequence tag libraries containing peptidases. A new way of making hyperlinks to the database has been devised and a BlastP search of our library of peptidase and inhibitor sequences has been added. 
 FLAGdb ++ is dedicated to the integration and visualization of data for high‐throughput functional analysis of a fully sequenced genome, as illustrated for Arabidopsis . FLAGdb ++ displays the predicted or experimental data in a position‐dependent way and displays correlations and relationships between different features. FLAGdb ++ provides for a given genome region, summarized characteristics of experimental materials like probe lengths, locations and specificities having an impact upon the confidence we will put in the experimental results. A selected subset of the available information is linked to a locus represented on an easy‐to‐interpret and memorable graphical display. Data are curated, processed and formatted before their integration into FLAGdb ++ . FLAGdb ++ contains different options for easy back and forth navigation through many loci selected at the start of a session. It includes an original two‐component visualization of the data, a genome‐wide and a local view, which are permanently linked and display complementary information. Density curves along the chromosomes may be displayed in parallel for suggesting correlations between different structural and functional data. FLAGdb ++ is fully accessible at http://genoplante‐info.infobiogen.fr/FLAGdb/ . 
 The rapid pace at which genomic and proteomic data is being generated necessitates the development of tools and resources for managing data that allow integration of information from disparate sources. The Human Protein Reference Database ( http://www.hprd.org ) is a web‐based resource based on open source technologies for protein information about several aspects of human proteins including protein–protein interactions, post‐translational modifications, enzyme–substrate relationships and disease associations. This information was derived manually by a critical reading of the published literature by expert biologists and through bioinformatics analyses of the protein sequence. This database will assist in biomedical discoveries by serving as a resource of genomic and proteomic information and providing an integrated view of sequence, structure, function and protein networks in health and disease. 
 The yeast Microarray Global Viewer (yMGV @ http://transcriptome.ens.fr/ymgv ) was created 3 years ago as a database that houses a collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharo myces pombe microarray data sets published in 82 different articles. yMGV couples data mining tools with a user‐friendly web interface so that, with a few mouse clicks, one can identify the conditions that affect the expression of a gene or list of genes regulated in a set of experiments. One of the major new features we present here is a set of tools that allows for inter‐organism comparisons. This should enable the fission yeast community to take advantage of the large amount of available information on budding yeast transcriptome. New tools and ongoing developments are also presented here. 
 HOMSTRAD ( http://www‐cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/ homstrad/ ) is a collection of protein families, clustered on the basis of sequence and structural similarity. The database is unique in that the protein family sequence alignments have been specially annotated using the program, JOY, to highlight a wide range of structural features. Such data are useful for identifying key structurally conserved residues within the families. Superpositions of the structures within each family are also available and a sensitive structure‐aided search engine, FUGUE, can be used to search the database for matches to a query protein sequence. Historically, HOMSTRAD families were generated using several key pieces of software, including COMPARER and MNYFIT, and held in a number of flat files and indexes. A new relational database version of HOMSTRAD, HOMSTRAD BETA ( http://www‐cryst.bioc.cam. ac.uk/homstradbeta/ ) is being developed using MySQL. This relational data structure provides more flexibility for future developments, reduces update times and makes data more easily accessible. Consequently it has been possible to add a number of new web features including a custom alignment facility. Altogether, this makes HOMSTRAD and its new BETA version, an excellent resource both for comparative modelling and for identifying distant sequence/structure similarities between proteins. 
 We have constructed coli BASE, a database for Escherichia coli , Shigella and Salmonella comparative genomics available online at http://colibase. bham.ac.uk . Unlike other E.coli databases, which focus on the laboratory model strain K12, coli BASE is intended to reflect the full diversity of E.coli and its relatives. The database contains comparative data including whole genome alignments and lists of putative orthologous genes, together with numerous analytical tools and links to existing online resources. The data are stored in a relational database, accessible by a number of user‐friendly search methods and graphical browsers. The database schema is generic and can easily be applied to other bacterial genomes. Two such databases, Campy DB (for the analysis of Campylobacter spp.) and Clostri DB (for Clostridium spp.) are also available at http://campy.bham.ac.uk and http://clostri. bham.ac.uk , respectively. An example of the power of E.coli comparative analyses such as those available through coli BASE is presented. 
 WormBase ( http://www.wormbase.org/ ) is the central data repository for information about Caenorhabditis elegans and related nematodes. As a model organism database, WormBase extends beyond the genomic sequence, integrating experimental results with extensively annotated views of the genome. The WormBase Consortium continues to expand the biological scope and utility of WormBase with the inclusion of large‐scale genomic analyses, through active data and literature curation, through new analysis and visualization tools, and through refinement of the user interface. Over the past year, the nearly complete genomic sequence and comparative analyses of the closely related species Caenorhabditis briggsae have been integrated into WormBase, including gene predictions, ortholog assignments and a new synteny viewer to display the relationships between the two species. Extensive site‐wide refinement of the user interface now provides quick access to the most frequently accessed resources and a consistent browsing experience across the site. Unified single‐page views now provide complete summaries of commonly accessed entries like genes. These advances continue to increase the utility of WormBase for C.elegans researchers, as well as for those researchers exploring problems in functional and comparative genomics in the context of a powerful genetic system. 
 The FREP database ( http://facts.gsc.riken.go.jp/FREP/ ) contains 31 396 RepeatMasker‐identified non‐redundant variant repeat sequences derived from 16 527 mouse cDNAs with protein‐coding potential. The repeats were computationally associated with potential effects on transcriptional variation, translation, protein function or involvement in disease to identify Functional REPeats (FREPs). FREPs are defined by the (i) occurrence of exon–exon boundaries in repeats, (ii) presence of polyadenylation sites in 3′UTR‐located repeats, (iii) effect on translation, (iv) position in the protein‐ coding region or protein domains or (v) conditional association with disease MeSH terms. Currently the database contains 9261 (29.5%) inferred FREPs derived from 6861 (41.5%) mouse cDNAs. Integrated evidence of the functional assignments and dynamically generated sequence similarity search results support the exploration and annotation of functional, ancestral or taxon‐specific repeats. Keyword and pre‐selected feature searches (e.g. coding sequence–repeat or splice site–repeat relations) support intuitive database querying as well as the retrieval of repeat sequences. Integrated sequence search and alignment tools allow the analysis of known or identification of new functional repeat candidates. FREP is a unique resource for illuminating the role of transposons and repetitive sequences in shaping the coding part of the mouse transcriptome and for selecting the appropriate experimental model to study diseases with suspected repeat etiology contributions. 
 GELBANK is a publicly available database of two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) gel patterns of proteomes from organisms with known genome information (available at http://gelbank.anl.gov and ftp://bioinformatics.anl.gov/gelbank/). Currently it includes 131 completed, mostly microbial proteomes available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. A web interface allows the upload of 2D gel patterns and their annotation for registered users. The images are organized by species, tissue type, separation method, sample type and staining method. The database can be queried based on protein or 2DE‐pattern attributes. A web interface allows registered users to assign molecular weight and pH gradient profiles to their own 2D gel patterns as well as to link protein identifications to a given spot on the pattern. The website presents all of the submitted 2D gel patterns where the end‐user can dynamically display the images or parts of images along with molecular weight, pH profile information and linked protein identification. A collection of images can be selected for the creation of animations from which the user can select sub‐regions of interest and unlimited 2D gel patterns for visualization. The website currently presents 233 identifications for 81 gel patterns for Homo sapiens , Methanococcus jannaschii , Pyro coccus furiosus , Shewanella oneidensis , Escherichia coli and Deinococcus radiodurans . 
 IntEnz is the name for the Integrated relational Enzyme database and is the official version of the Enzyme Nomenclature. The Enzyme Nomenclature comprises recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Bio chemistry and Molecular Biology (NC‐IUBMB) on the nomenclature and classification of enzyme‐catalysed reactions. IntEnz is supported by NC‐IUBMB and contains enzyme data curated and approved by this committee. The database IntEnz is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intenz . 
 The aMAZE LightBench ( http://www.amaze.ulb. ac.be/ ) is a web interface to the aMAZE relational database, which contains information on gene expression, catalysed chemical reactions, regulatory interactions, protein assembly, as well as metabolic and signal transduction pathways. It allows the user to browse the information in an intuitive way, which also reflects the underlying data model. Moreover links are provided to literature references, and whenever appropriate, to external databases. 
 We have developed an integrated database that is specialized for the study of imprinted disease genes. The database contains novel candidate imprinted genes identified by the RIKEN full‐length mouse cDNA microarray study, information on validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to confirm imprinting using reciprocal mouse crosses and the predicted physical position of imprinting‐related disease loci in the mouse and human genomes. It has two user‐friendly search interfaces: the SNP‐central view (MuSCAT: MoUse SNP CATalog) and the candidate gene‐central view (CITE: Candidate Imprinted Transcripts by Expression). The database, EICO (Expression‐based Imprint Candidate Organizer), can be accessed via the World Wide Web ( http://fantom2.gsc.riken.jp/EICODB/ ) and the DAS client software. These data and interfaces facilitate understanding of the mechanism of imprinting in mammalian inherited traits. 
 Rice is a major food staple for the world’s population and serves as a model species in cereal genome research. The Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) has long been devoting itself to sequencing, information analysis and biological research of the rice and other crop genomes. In order to facilitate the application of the rice genomic information and to provide a foundation for functional and evolutionary studies of other important cereal crops, we implemented our Rice Information System (BGI‐RIS), the most up‐to‐date integrated information resource as well as a workbench for comparative genomic analysis. In addition to comprehensive data from Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica sequenced by BGI, BGI‐RIS also hosts carefully curated genome information from Oryza sativa L. ssp . japonica and EST sequences available from other cereal crops. In this resource, sequence contigs of indica (93‐11) have been further assembled into Mbp‐sized scaffolds and anchored onto the rice chromosomes referenced to physical/genetic markers, cDNAs and BAC‐end sequences. We have annotated the rice genomes for gene content, repetitive elements, gene duplications (tandem and segmental) and single nucleotide polymorphisms between rice subspecies. Designed as a basic platform, BGI‐RIS presents the sequenced genomes and related information in systematic and graphical ways for the convenience of in‐depth comparative studies ( http://rise.genomics.org.cn/ ). 
 The Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (MaizeGDB) is a central repository for maize sequence, stock, phenotype, genotypic and karyotypic variation, and chromosomal mapping data. In addition, MaizeGDB provides contact information for over 2400 maize cooperative researchers, facilitating interactions between members of the rapidly expanding maize community. MaizeGDB represents the synthesis of all data available previously from ZmDB and from MaizeDB—databases that have been superseded by MaizeGDB. MaizeGDB provides web‐based tools for ordering maize stocks from several organizations including the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center and the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station (NCRPIS). Sequence searches yield records displayed with embedded links to facilitate ordering cloned sequences from various groups including the Maize Gene Discovery Project and the Clemson University Genomics Institute. An intuitive web interface is implemented to facilitate navigation between related data, and analytical tools are embedded within data displays. Web‐based curation tools for both designated experts and general researchers are currently under development. MaizeGDB can be accessed at http://www.maizegdb.org/ . 
 The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Table Browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi‐bin/hgText ) provides text‐based access to a large collection of genome assemblies and annotation data stored in the Genome Browser Database. A flexible alternative to the graphical‐based Genome Browser, this tool offers an enhanced level of query support that includes restrictions based on field values, free‐form SQL queries and combined queries on multiple tables. Output can be filtered to restrict the fields and lines returned, and may be organized into one of several formats, including a simple tab‐ delimited file that can be loaded into a spreadsheet or database as well as advanced formats that may be uploaded into the Genome Browser as custom annotation tracks. The Table Browser User’s Guide located on the UCSC website provides instructions and detailed examples for constructing queries and configuring output. 
 PlantGDB ( http://www.plantgdb.org/ ) is a database of molecular sequence data for all plant species with significant sequencing efforts. The database organizes EST sequences into contigs that represent tentative unique genes. Contigs are annotated and, whenever possible, linked to their respective genomic DNA. Genome sequence fragments are assembled similarly. The goal of the PlantGDB web site is to establish the basis for identifying sets of genes common to all plants or specific to particular species by integrating a number of bioinformatics tools that facilitate gene prediction and cross‐ species comparisons. For species with large‐scale genome sequencing efforts, PlantGDB provides genome browsing capabilities that integrate all available EST and cDNA evidence for current gene models (for Arabidopsis thaliana , see the AtGDB site at http://www.plantgdb.org/AtGDB/ ). 
 Full‐malaria ( http://fullmal.ims.u‐tokyo.ac.jp ), a database for full‐length cDNAs from the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum has been updated in at least three points. (i) We added 8934 sequences generated from the addition of new libraries, so that our collection of 11 424 full‐length cDNAs covers 1375 (25%) of the estimated number of the entire 5409 parasite genes. (ii) All of our full‐length cDNAs and GenBank EST sequences were mapped to genomic sequences together with publicly available annotated genes and other predictions. This precisely determined the gene structures and positions of the transcriptional start sites, which are indispensable for the identification of the promoter regions. (iii) A total of 4257 cDNA sequences were newly generated from murine malaria parasites, Plasmodium yoelii yoelii . The genome/cDNA sequences were compared at both nucleotide and amino acid levels, with those of P.falciparum , and the sequence alignment for each gene is presented graphically. This part of the database serves as a versatile platform to elucidate the function(s) of malaria genes by a comparative genomic approach. It should also be noted that all of the cDNAs represented in this database are supported by physical cDNA clones, which are publicly and freely available, and should serve as indispensable resources to explore functional analyses of malaria genomes. 
 CryptoDB ( http://CryptoDB.org ) represents a collaborative effort to locate all genome data for the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum in a single user‐friendly database. CryptoDB currently houses the genomic sequence data for both the human type 1 H strain and the bovine type 2 IOWA strain in addition to all other available EST and GSS sequences obtained from public repositories. All data are available for data mining via BLAST, keyword searches of pre‐computed BLASTX results and user‐defined or PROSITE motif pattern searches. Release 1.0 of CryptoDB contains ∼19 million bases of genome sequence for the H and IOWA strains and an additional ∼24 million bases of GSS and EST sequence obtained from other sources. Open reading frames greater than 50 and 100 amino acids have been generated for all sequences and all data are available for bulk download. This database, like other apicomplexan parasite databases, has been built utilizing the PlasmoDB model. 
 GeneDB ( http://www.genedb.org/ ) is a genome database for prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The resource provides a portal through which data generated by the Pathogen Sequencing Unit at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and other collaborating sequencing centres can be made publicly available. It combines data from finished and ongoing genome and expressed sequence tag (EST) projects with curated annotation, that can be searched, sorted and downloaded, using a single web based resource. The current release stores 11 datasets of which six are curated and maintained by biologists, who review and incorporate information from the scientific literature, public databases and the respective research communities. 
 The CyberCell Database (CCDB: http://redpoll. pharmacy.ualberta.ca/CCDB ) is a comprehensive, web‐accessible database designed to support and coordinate international efforts in modeling an Escherichia coli cell on a computer. The CCDB brings together both observed and derived quantitative data from numerous independent sources covering many aspects of the genomic, proteomic and metabolomic character of E.coli (strain K12). The database is self‐updating but also supports ‘community’ annotation, and provides an extensive array of viewing, querying and search options including a powerful, easy‐to‐use relational data extraction system. 
 The Unified Medical Language System ( http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov ) is a repository of biomedical vocabularies developed by the US National Library of Medicine. The UMLS integrates over 2 million names for some 900 000 concepts from more than 60 families of biomedical vocabularies, as well as 12 million relations among these concepts. Vocabularies integrated in the UMLS Metathesaurus include the NCBI taxonomy, Gene Ontology, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), OMIM and the Digital Anatomist Symbolic Knowledge Base. UMLS concepts are not only inter‐related, but may also be linked to external resources such as GenBank. In addition to data, the UMLS includes tools for customizing the Metathesaurus (MetamorphoSys), for generating lexical variants of concept names (lvg) and for extracting UMLS concepts from text (MetaMap). The UMLS knowledge sources are updated quarterly. All vocabularies are available at no fee for research purposes within an institution, but UMLS users are required to sign a license agreement. The UMLS knowledge sources are distributed on CD‐ROM and by FTP. 
 Pathbase is a database that stores images of the abnormal histology associated with spontaneous and induced mutations of both embryonic and adult mice including those produced by transgenesis, targeted mutagenesis and chemical mutagenesis. Images of normal mouse histology and strain‐dependent background lesions are also available. The database and the images are publicly accessible ( http://www.pathbase.net ) and linked by anatomical site, gene and other identifiers to relevant databases; there are also facilities for public comment and record annotation. The database is structured around a novel ontology of mouse disorders (MPATH) and provides high‐resolution downloadable images of normal and diseased tissues that are searchable through orthogonal ontologies for pathology, developmental stage, anatomy and gene attributes (GO terms), together with controlled vocabularies for type of genetic manipulation or mutation, genotype and free text annotation for mouse strain and additional attributes. The database is actively curated and data records assessed by pathologists in the Pathbase Consortium before publication. The database interface is designed to have optimal browser and platform compatibility and to interact directly with other web‐based mouse genetic resources. 
 The Gene Ontology (GO) project ( http://www. geneontology.org/ ) provides structured, controlled vocabularies and classifications that cover several domains of molecular and cellular biology and are freely available for community use in the annotation of genes, gene products and sequences. Many model organism databases and genome annotation groups use the GO and contribute their annotation sets to the GO resource. The GO database integrates the vocabularies and contributed annotations and provides full access to this information in several formats. Members of the GO Consortium continually work collectively, involving outside experts as needed, to expand and update the GO vocabularies. The GO Web resource also provides access to extensive documentation about the GO project and links to applications that use GO data for functional analyses. 
 The Rice Proteome Database is the first detailed database to describe the proteome of rice. The current release contains 21 reference maps based on two‐dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D‐PAGE) of proteins from rice tissues and subcellular compartments. These reference maps comprise 11 941 identified proteins showing tissue and subcellular localization, corresponding to 4180 separate protein entries in the database. The Rice Proteome Database contains the calculated properties of each protein such as molecular weight, isoelectric point and expression; experimentally determined properties such as amino acid sequences obtained using protein sequencers and mass spectrometry; and the results of database searches such as sequence homologies. The database is searchable by keyword, accession number, protein name, isoelectric point, molecular weight and amino acid sequence, or by selection of a spot on one of the 2D‐PAGE reference maps. Cross‐references are provided to tools for proteomics and to other 2D‐PAGE databases, which in turn provide many links to other molecular databases. The information in the Rice Proteome Database is updated weekly, and is available on the World Wide Web at http://gene64.dna.affrc.go.jp/RPD/ . 
 The Peptaibol Database is a sequence and structure resource for the unusual class of peptides known as peptaibols. These peptides exhibit antibiotic and membrane channel‐forming activities. The database includes sequence, biological source and bibliographical data for the naturally occurring peptaibols. Information is also collated for the growing number of peptaibol 3D structures determined by either crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. The database can be obtained as a whole or can be queried by name, group, sequence motif, biological origin and/or literature reference. The Peptaibol Database can be freely accessed at http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/peptaibol . 
 VirGen is a comprehensive viral genome resource that organizes the ‘sequence space’ of viral genomes in a structured fashion. It has been developed with the objective of serving as an annotated and curated database comprising complete genome sequences of viruses, value‐added derived data and data mining tools. The current release (v1.1) contains 559 complete genomes in addition to 287 putative genomes of viruses belonging to eight viral families for which the host range includes animals and plants. Viral genomes in VirGen are annotated using sequence‐based Bioinformatics approaches. The genomic data is also curated to identify ‘alternate names’ of viral proteins, where available. VirGen archives the results of comparisons of genomes, proteomes and individual proteins within and between viral species. It is the first resource to provide phylogenetic trees of viral species computed using whole‐genome sequence data. The module of predicted B‐cell antigenic determinants in VirGen is an attempt to link the genome to its vaccinome. Comparative genome analysis data facilitate the study of genome organization and evolution of viruses, which would have implications in applied research to identify candidates for the design of vaccines and antiviral drugs. VirGen is a relational database and is available at http://bioinfo. ernet.in/virgen/virgen.html . 
Alu elements are short interspersed elements (SINEs) ∼300 nucleotides in length. More than 1 million Alu s are found in the human genome. Despite their being genetically functionless, recent findings suggest that Alu elements may have a broad evolutionary impact by affecting gene structures, protein sequences, splicing motifs and expression patterns. Because of these effects, compiling a genomic database of Alu sequences that reside within protein‐coding genes seemed a useful enterprise. Presently, such data are limited since the structural and positional information on genes and Alu sequences are scattered throughout incompatible and unconnected databases. Alu Gene ( http://Alugene.tau.ac.il/ ) provides easy access to a complete Alu map of the human genome, as well as Alu ‐associated information. The Alu elements are annotated with respect to coding region and exon/intron location. This design facilitates queries on Alu sequences, locations, as well as motifs and compositional properties via a one‐stop search page. 
 ApiEST‐DB ( http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/paradbs‐servlet/ ) provides integrated access to publicly available EST data from protozoan parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa. The database currently incorporates a total of nearly 100 000 ESTs from several parasite species of clinical and/or veterinary interest, including Eimeria tenella , Neospora caninum , Plasmodium falciparum , Sarcocystis neurona and Toxoplasma gondii . To facilitate analysis of these data, EST sequences were clustered and assembled to form consensus sequences for each organism, and these assemblies were then subjected to automated annotation via similarity searches against protein and domain databases. The underlying relational database infrastructure, Genomics Unified Schema (GUS), enables complex biologically based queries, facilitating validation of gene models, identification of alternative splicing, detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms, identification of stage‐specific genes and recognition of phylogenetically conserved and phylogenetically restricted sequences. 
Pristionchus pacificus is a free‐living nematode of the Diplogastridae family and was recently developed as a satellite system in evolutionary developmental biology. AppaDB, a P.pacificus database, was created ( http://appadb.eb.tuebingen. mpg.de ) to integrate the genomic data of P.pacificus , comprising the physical map, genetic linkage map, EST and BAC end sequence and hybridization data. This developing database serves as a repository to search and find any information regarding physical contigs or genetic markers required for mapping of mutants. Additionally, it provides a platform for the Caenorhabditis elegans community to compare nematode genetic data in an evolutionary perspective. 
 The database of topographic mapping of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (topoSNP) provides an online resource for analyzing non‐synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) that can be mapped onto known 3D structures of proteins. These include disease‐ associated nsSNPs derived from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database and other nsSNPs derived from dbSNP, a resource at the National Center for Biotechnology Information that catalogs SNPs. TopoSNP further classifies each nsSNP site into three categories based on their geometric location: those located in a surface pocket or an interior void of the protein, those on a convex region or a shallow depressed region, and those that are completely buried in the interior of the protein structure. These unique geometric descriptions provide more detailed mapping of nsSNPs to protein structures. The current release also includes relative entropy of SNPs calculated from multiple sequence alignment as obtained from the Pfam database (a database of protein families and conserved protein motifs) as well as manually adjusted multiple alignments obtained from ClustalW. These structural and conservational data can be useful for studying whether nsSNPs in coding regions are likely to lead to phenotypic changes. TopoSNP includes an interactive structural visualization web interface, as well as downloadable batch data. The database will be updated at regular intervals and can be accessed at: http://gila.bioengr.uic.edu/snp/toposnp . 
 IMGT/GeneInfo is a user‐friendly online information system that provides information on data resulting from the complex mechanisms of immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) V(D)J recombinations. For the first time, it is possible to visualize all the rearrangement parameters on a single page. IMGT/GeneInfo is part of the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® (IMGT), a high‐quality integrated knowledge resource specializing in IG, TR, major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and related proteins of the immune system of human and other vertebrate species. The IMGT/GeneInfo system was developed by the TIMC and ICH laboratories (with the collaboration of LIGM), and is the first example of an external system being incorporated into IMGT. In this paper, we report the first part of this work. IMGT/GeneInfo_TR deals with the human and mouse TRA/TRD and TRB loci of the TR. Data handling and visualization are complementary to the current data and tools in IMGT, and will subsequently allow the modelling of V(D)J gene use, and thus, to predict non‐standard recombination profiles which may eventually be found in conditions such as leukaemias or lymphomas. Access to IMGT/GeneInfo is free and can be found at http://imgt.cines.fr/GeneInfo . 
 TransportDB ( http://www.membranetransport.org ) is a relational database designed for describing the predicted cellular membrane transport proteins in organisms whose complete genome sequences are available. For each organism, the complete set of membrane transport systems was identified and classified into different types and families according to putative membrane topology, protein family, bioenergetics and substrate specificities. Web pages were created to provide user‐friendly interfaces to easily access, query and download the data. Additional features, such as a BLAST search tool against known transporter protein sequences, comparison of transport systems from different organisms and phylogenetic trees of individual transporter families are also provided. TransportDB will be regularly updated with data obtained from newly sequenced genomes. 
 Release 4.0 of ProTherm, thermodynamic database for proteins and mutants, contains ∼14 500 numerical data (∼450% of the first version) of several thermodynamic parameters along with experimental methods and conditions, and structural, functional and literature information. The sequence and structural information of proteins is connected with thermodynamic data through links between entries in Protein Data Bank, Protein Information Resource and SWISS‐PROT and the data in ProTherm. We have separated the Gibbs free energy change obtained at extrapolated temperature from the data on denaturation temperature measured by the thermal denaturation method. We have added the statistics of amino acid replacements and links to homologous structures to each protein. Further, we have improved the search and display options to enhance search capability through the web interface. ProTherm is freely available at http://gibk26. bse.kyutech.ac.jp/jouhou/Protherm/protherm.html . 
 We have created an Amino Acid–Nucleotide Interaction Database (AANT; http://aant.icmb.utexas. edu/ ) that categorizes all amino acid–nucleotide interactions from experimentally determined protein–nucleic acid structures, and provides users with a graphic interface for visualizing these interactions in aggregate. AANT accomplishes this by extracting individual amino acid–nucleotide interactions from structures in the Protein Data Bank, combining and superimposing these interactions into multiple structure files (e.g. 20 amino acids × 5 nucleotides) and grouping structurally similar interactions into more readily identifiable clusters. Using the Chime web browser plug‐in, users can view 3D representations of the superimpositions and clusters. The unique collection and representation of data on amino acid–nucleotide interactions facilitates understanding the specificity of protein–nucleic acid interactions at a more fundamental level, and allows comparison of otherwise extremely disparate sets of structures. Moreover, by modularly representing the fundamental interactions that govern binding specificity it may prove possible to better engineer nucleic acid binding proteins. 
 The aptamer database is designed to contain comprehensive sequence information on aptamers and unnatural ribozymes that have been generated by in vitro selection methods. Such data are not normally collected in ‘natural’ sequence databases, such as GenBank. Besides serving as a storehouse of sequences that may have diagnostic or therapeutic utility, the database serves as a valuable resource for theoretical biologists who describe and explore fitness landscapes. The database is updated monthly and is publicly available at http://aptamer. icmb.utexas.edu/ . 
 MODBASE ( http://salilab.org/modbase ) is a relational database of annotated comparative protein structure models for all available protein sequences matched to at least one known protein structure. The models are calculated by MODPIPE, an automated modeling pipeline that relies on the MODELLER package for fold assignment, sequence–structure alignment, model building and model assessment ( http:/salilab.org/modeller ). MODBASE uses the MySQL relational database management system for flexible querying and CHIMERA for viewing the sequences and structures ( http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/ ). MODBASE is updated regularly to reflect the growth in protein sequence and structure databases, as well as improvements in the software for calculating the models. For ease of access, MODBASE is organized into different data sets. The largest data set contains 1 262 629 models for domains in 659 495 out of 1 182 126 unique protein sequences in the complete Swiss‐Prot/TrEMBL database (August 25, 2003); only models based on alignments with significant similarity scores and models assessed to have the correct fold despite insignificant alignments are included. Another model data set supports target selection and structure‐based annotation by the New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium; e.g. the 53 new structures produced by the consortium allowed us to characterize structurally 24 113 sequences. MODBASE also contains binding site predictions for small ligands and a set of predicted interactions between pairs of modeled sequences from the same genome. Our other resources associated with MODBASE include a comprehensive database of multiple protein structure alignments (DBALI, http://salilab.org/dbali ) as well as web servers for automated comparative modeling with MODPIPE (MODWEB, http://salilab. org/modweb ), modeling of loops in protein structures (MODLOOP, http://salilab.org/modloop ) and predicting functional consequences of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPWEB, http://salilab. org/snpweb ). 
 ERGDB is an integrated knowledge database dedicated to genes responsive to estrogen. Genes included in ERGDB are those whose expression levels are experimentally proven to be either up‐regulated or down‐regulated by estrogen. Genes included are identified based on publications from the PubMed database and each record has been manually examined, evaluated and selected for inclusion by biologists. ERGDB aims to be a unified gateway to store, search, retrieve and update information about estrogen responsive genes. Each record contains links to relevant databases, such as GenBank, LocusLink, Refseq, PubMed and ATCC. The unique feature of ERGDB is that it contains information on the dependence of gene reactions on experimental conditions. In addition to basic information about the genes, information for each record includes gene functional description, experimental methods used, tissue or cell type, gene reaction, estrogen exposure time and the summary of putative estrogen response elements if the gene’s promoter sequence was available. Through a web interface at http://sdmc.i2r.a‐star.edu.sg/ergdb/ cgi‐bin/explore.pl users can either browse or query ERGDB. Access is free for academic and non‐profit users. 
 Hembase ( http://hembase.niddk.nih.gov ) is an integrated browser and genome portal designed for web‐based examination of the human erythroid transcriptome. To date, Hembase contains 15 752 entries from erythroblast Expressed Sequenced Tags (ESTs) and 380 referenced genes relevant for erythropoiesis. The database is organized to provide a cytogenetic band position, a unique name as well as a concise annotation for each entry. Search queries may be performed by name, keyword or cytogenetic location. Search results are linked to primary sequence data and three major human genome browsers for access to information considered current at the time of each search. Hembase provides interested scientists and clinical hematologists with a genome‐based approach toward the study of erythroid biology. 
 Gene expression is controlled mainly by the binding of transcription factors to regulatory sequences. To generate a genomic map for regulatory sequences, the Arabidopsis thaliana genome was screened for putative transcription factor binding sites. Using publicly available data from the TRANSFAC database and from publications, alignment matrices for 23 transcription factors of 13 different factor families were used with the pattern search program Patser to determine the genomic positions of more than 2.4 × 10 6 putative binding sites. Due to the dense clustering of genes and the observation that regulatory sequences are not restricted to upstream regions, the prediction of binding sites was performed for the whole genome. The genomic positions and the underlying data were imported into the newly developed AthaMap database. This data can be accessed by positional information or the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative identification number. Putative binding sites are displayed in the defined region. Data on the matrices used and on the thresholds applied in these screens are given in the database. Considering the high density of sites it will be a valuable resource for generating models on gene expression regulation. The data are available at http://www.athamap.de . 
 TropGENE‐DB, is a crop information system created to store genetic, molecular and phenotypic data of the numerous yet poorly documented tropical crop species. The most common data stored in TropGENE‐DB are information on genetic resources (agro‐morphological data, parentages, allelic diversity), molecular markers, genetic maps, results of quantitative trait loci analyses, data from physical mapping, sequences, genes, as well as the corresponding references. TropGENE‐DB is organized on a crop basis with currently three running modules (sugarcane, cocoa and banana), with plans to create additional modules for rice, cotton, oil palm, coconut, rubber tree, pineapple, taro, yam and sorghum. The TropGENE‐DB information system is accessible for consultation via the internet at http://tropgenedb.cirad.fr . Specific web consultation interfaces have been designed to allow quick consultations as well as complex queries. 
 All the protein sequences from plants (including Arabidopsis thaliana ) available from SwissProt/TrEMBL have been the subject of an all‐by‐all systematic comparison and grouped into clusters of related proteins. Within each cluster, the sequences have been submitted to pyramidal classification; in the case where two or several subfamilies have been grouped together, the pyramidal tree helps in finding which sequences make the links between subfamilies. In addition, the ‘domains’ that are common to two or more sequences within a cluster were determined and displayed à la ProDom. The resulting graphical representations proved to be quite efficient in pinpointing those protein sequences suffering from a probable error in the annotation of their genes. The clusters can be searched through various criteria and their pyramidal classifications and their domain representations can be displayed by querying http://genoplante‐info. infobiogen.fr/phytoprot . The user can also launch a BLAST search of a query sequence against all the clusters. 
 To study the global regulation of cell morphology, a number of groups have recently reported genome‐wide screening data for yeast mutants with abnormal morphology. Despite the relatively simple ellipsoidal shape of yeast cells, in the past, cell morphology researchers have processed information on cells manually. These time‐consuming, entirely subjective tasks motivated us to develop image‐processing software that automatically extracts yeast cells from micrographs and processes them to measure key morphological characteristics such as cell size, roundness, bud neck position angle, nuclear DNA localization and actin localization. To date, we have retrieved 960 609 cells from 52 988 micrographs of 2531 mutants using our software, and we have published the results in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Morphological Database (SCMD), which facilitates the analysis of abnormal cells. Our system provides quantitative data for shapes of the daughter and mother cells, localization of the nuclear DNA and morphology of the actin patches. To search for mutants with similar morphological traits, the system outputs a list of mutants ranked by similarity of average morphological parameters. The SCMD is available at http://yeast. gi.k.u‐tokyo.ac.jp/ . 
 Hematopoiesis describes the process of the normal formation and development of blood cells, involving both proliferation and differentiation from stem cells. Abnormalities in this developmental program yield blood cell diseases, such as leukemia. Although, in recent years, extensive molecular research in normal hematopoietic development has characterized transcription factors and their binding sites in the target gene promoters, the information generated is highly fragmented. In order to integrate this important regulatory information with the corresponding genomic sequences, we have developed a new database called Hematopoiesis Promoter Database (HemoPDB). HemoPDB is a comprehensive resource focused on transcriptional regulation during hematopoietic development and associated aberrances that result in malignancy. HemoPDB (version 1.0) contains 246 promoter sequences and 604 experimentally known cis ‐regulatory elements of 187 different transcription factors, with links to published references. Orthologous promoters from different species are linked with each other and displayed in the same database record, accompanied by a visual image of the promoters and corresponding annotations of cis ‐regulatory elements. HemoPDB may be searched for the promoter of a specific gene, transcription factors and target genes, and genes that are expressed in a certain cell type or lineage, through a user‐friendly web interface at http://bioinformatics.med.ohio‐state.edu/HemoPDB . Links to the documentation and other technical details are provided on this website. 
 The Rice Genome Research Project in Japan performs genome sequencing and comprehensive expression profiling, constructs genetic and physical maps, collects full‐length cDNAs and generates mutant lines, all aimed at improving the breeding of the rice plant as a food source. The National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences in Tsukuba, Japan, has accumulated numerous rice biological resources and has already successfully produced a high‐quality genome sequence, a high‐density genetic map with 3000 markers, 30 000 full‐length cDNAs, over 700 expression profiles with a 9000 cDNA microarray and 15 000 flanking sequences with Tos17 insertions in about 3765 mutant lines from about 50 000 transposon insertion lines. These resources are available in the public domain. A new unification tool for functional genomics, called Rice PIPELINE, has also been developed for the dynamic collection and compilation of genomics data (genome sequences, full‐length cDNAs, gene expression profiles, mutant lines, cis elements) from various databases. The mission of Rice PIPELINE is to provide a unique scientific resource that pools publicly available rice genomic data for search by clone sequence, clone name, GenBank accession number, or keyword. The web‐based form of Rice PIPELINE is available at http://cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/PIPE/ . 
 DBTSS ( http://dbtss.hgc.jp ) was originally constructed based on a collection of experimentally determined TSSs of human genes. Since its first release in 2002, it has been updated several times. First, the amount of stored data has increased significantly: e.g. the number of clones that match both the RefSeq mRNA set and the genome sequence has increased from 111 382 to 190 964, now covering 11 234 genes. Second, the positions of SNPs in dbSNP were displayed on the upstream regions of contained human genes. Third, DBTSS now covers other species such as mouse and the human malaria parasite. It will become a central database containing data for many more species with oligo‐capping and related methods. Lastly, the database now serves for comparative promoter analyses: in the current version, comparative views of potentially orthologous promoters from human and mouse are presented with an additional function of searching potential transcription‐factor binding sites, which are either conserved or diverged between species. 
 In a number of higher plants, a substantial portion of the genome is composed of repetitive sequences that can hinder genome annotation and sequencing efforts. To better understand the nature of repetitive sequences in plants and provide a resource for identifying such sequences, we constructed databases of repetitive sequences for 12 plant genera: Arabidopsis , Brassica , Glycine , Hordeum , Lotus , Lycopersicon , Medicago , Oryza , Solanum , Sorghum , Triticum and Zea ( www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/plant. repeats/index.shtml ). The repetitive sequences within each database have been coded into super‐classes, classes and sub‐classes based on sequence and structure similarity. These databases are available for sequence similarity searches as well as downloadable files either as entire databases or subsets of each database. To further the utility for comparative studies and to provide a resource for searching for repetitive sequences in other genera within these families, repetitive sequences have been combined into four databases to represent the Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Gramineae and Solanaceae families. Collectively, these databases provide a resource for the identification, classification and analysis of repetitive sequences in plants. 
 NASC operates an Affymetrix ‘GeneChip’ (microarray) service for the Arabidopsis thaliana community. All data produced by the service are publicly available through our microarray data base ‘NASCArrays’ published at http://affymetrix. arabidopsis.info . The data are accessible through text searching and a series of data mining tools. All data are annotated with sample preparation details, and the original Affymetrix data are available for download. The database aims to be MIAME supportive and provide a coordinated resource for re searchers interested in the transcriptome of Arabidopsis . Using this database, data produced will be shared with other databases worldwide. 
 The Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA ) aims to provide high‐quality electronic and manual annotations to the UniProt Knowledgebase (Swiss‐Prot, TrEMBL and PIR‐PSD) using the standardized vocabulary of the Gene Ontology (GO). As a supplementary archive of GO annotation, GOA promotes a high level of integration of the knowledge represented in UniProt with other databases. This is achieved by converting UniProt annotation into a recognized computational format. GOA provides annotated entries for nearly 60 000 species (GOA‐SPTr) and is the largest and most comprehensive open‐source contributor of annotations to the GO Consortium annotation effort. By integrating GO annotations from other model organism groups, GOA consolidates specialized knowledge and expertise to ensure the data remain a key reference for up‐to‐date biological information. Furthermore, the GOA database fully endorses the Human Proteomics Initiative by prioritizing the annotation of proteins likely to benefit human health and disease. In addition to a non‐redundant set of annotations to the human proteome (GOA‐Human) and monthly releases of its GO annotation for all species (GOA‐SPTr), a series of GO mapping files and specific cross‐references in other databases are also regularly distributed. GOA can be queried through a simple user‐friendly web interface or downloaded in a parsable format via the EBI and GO FTP websites. The GOA data set can be used to enhance the annotation of particular model organism or gene expression data sets, although increasingly it has been used to evaluate GO predictions generated from text mining or protein interaction experiments. In 2004, the GOA team will build on its success and will continue to supplement the functional annotation of UniProt and work towards enhancing the ability of scientists to access all available biological information. Researchers wishing to query or contribute to the GOA project are encouraged to email: goa@ebi.ac.uk . 
 We generated the PEDE (Pig EST Data Explorer; http://pede.dna.affrc.go.jp/ ) database using se quences assembled from porcine 5′ ESTs from oligo‐capped full‐length cDNA libraries. Thus far we have performed EST analysis of various organs (thymus, spleen, uterus, lung, liver, ovary and peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and assembled 68 076 high‐quality sequences into 5546 contigs and 28 461 singlets. PEDE provides a search interface for getting results of homology searches and enables users to obtain information on sequence data and cDNA clones of interest. Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms detected through comparison of the EST sequences are classified by origin (western and oriental breeds) and are searchable in the database. This database system can accelerate analyses of livestock traits and yields information that can lead to new applications in pigs as model systems for medical research. 
 The TOPS database holds topological descriptions of protein structures. These compact and highly abstract descriptions reduce the protein fold to a sequence of Secondary Structure Elements (SSEs) and three sets of pairwise relationships between them, hydrogen bonds relating parallel and anti‐ parallel β strands, spatial adjacencies relating neighbouring SSEs, and the chiralities of selected supersecondary structures, including connections in βαβ units and between parallel α helices. The database is used as a resource for visualizing folding topologies, fast topological pattern searching and structure comparison. Here, significant enhancements to the TOPS database are described. The topological description has been enhanced to include packing relationships between helices, which significantly improves the description of protein folds with little β strand content. Further, the topological description has been annotated with sequence information. The query interfaces to the database have been improved and the new version can be found at http://www.tops.leeds.ac.uk/ . 
 The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) is one component of the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) system ( http://www.informatics.jax.org ), a community database resource for the laboratory mouse. MGD strives to provide a comprehensive knowledgebase about the mouse with experiments and data annotated from both literature and online sources. MGD curates and presents consensus and experimental data representations of genetic, genotype (sequence) and phenotype information including highly detailed reports about genes and gene products. Primary foci of integration are through representations of relationships between genes, sequences and phenotypes. MGD collaborates with other bioinformatics groups to curate a definitive set of information about the laboratory mouse and to build and implement the data and semantic standards that are essential for comparative genome analysis. Recent developments in MGD discussed here include an extensive integration of the mouse sequence data and substantial revisions in the presentation, query and visualization of sequence data. 
 We have built a protein subcellular localization annotation database, the DBSubLoc database, which is available at http://www.bioinfo.tsinghua. edu.cn/dbsubloc.html . Annotations were taken from primary protein databases, model organism genome projects and literature texts, and then were analyzed to dig out the subcellular localization features of the proteins. The proteins are also classified into different categories. Based on sequence alignment, non‐redundant subsets of the database have been built, which may provide useful information for subcellular localization prediction. The database now contains >60 000 protein sequences including ∼30 000 protein sequences in the non‐redundant data sets. Online download, search and Blast tools are also available. 
 The Macromolecular Structure Database (MSD) group ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd/ ) continues to enhance the quality and consistency of macromolecular structure data in the worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) and to work towards the integration of various bioinformatics data resources. One of the major obstacles to the improved integration of structural databases such as MSD and sequence databases like UniProt is the absence of up to date and well-maintained mapping between corresponding entries. We have worked closely with the UniProt group at the EBI to clean up the taxonomy and sequence cross-reference information in the MSD and UniProt databases. This information is vital for the reliable integration of the sequence family databases such as Pfam and Interpro with the structure-oriented databases of SCOP and CATH. This information has been made available to the eFamily group ( http://www.efamily.org.uk/ ) and now forms the basis of the regular interchange of information between the member databases (MSD, UniProt, Pfam, Interpro, SCOP and CATH). This exchange of annotation information has enriched the structural information in the MSD database with annotation from wider sequence-oriented resources. This work was carried out under the ‘Structure Integration with Function, Taxonomy and Sequences (SIFTS)’ initiative ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/docs/sifts ) in the MSD group. 
 The PEDANT genome database ( http://pedant.gsf.de ) contains pre-computed bioinformatics analyses of publicly available genomes. Its main mission is to provide robust automatic annotation of the vast majority of amino acid sequences, which have not been subjected to in-depth manual curation by human experts in high-quality protein sequence databases. By design PEDANT annotation is genome-oriented, making it possible to explore genomic context of gene products, and evaluate functional and structural content of genomes using a category-based query mechanism. At present, the PEDANT database contains exhaustive annotation of over 1 240 000 proteins from 270 eubacterial, 23 archeal and 41 eukaryotic genomes. 
 The SIEGE (Smoking Induced Epithelial Gene Expression) database is a clinical resource for compiling and analyzing gene expression data from epithelial cells of the human intra-thoracic airway. This database supports a translational research study whose goal is to profile the changes in airway gene expression that are induced by cigarette smoke. RNA is isolated from airway epithelium obtained at bronchoscopy from current-, former- and never-smoker subjects, and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A Genechips, which measure the level of expression of ∼22 500 human transcripts. The microarray data generated along with relevant patient information is uploaded to SIEGE by study administrators using the database's web interface, found at http://pulm.bumc.bu.edu/siegeDB . PERL-coded scripts integrated with SIEGE perform various quality control functions including the processing, filtering and formatting of stored data. The R statistical package is used to import database expression values and execute a number of statistical analyses including t -tests, correlation coefficients and hierarchical clustering. Values from all statistical analyses can be queried through CGI-based tools and web forms found on the ‘Search’ section of the database website. Query results are embedded with graphical capabilities as well as with links to other databases containing valuable gene resources, including Entrez Gene, GO, Biocarta, GeneCards, dbSNP and the NCBI Map Viewer. 
 In addition to maintaining the GenBank(R) nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides data retrieval systems and computational resources for the analysis of data in GenBank and other biological data made available through NCBI's website. NCBI resources include Entrez, Entrez Programming Utilities, PubMed, PubMed Central, Entrez Gene, the NCBI Taxonomy Browser, BLAST, BLAST Link (BLink), Electronic PCR, OrfFinder, Spidey, RefSeq, UniGene, HomoloGene, ProtEST, dbMHC, dbSNP, Cancer Chromosomes, Entrez Genomes and related tools, the Map Viewer, Model Maker, Evidence Viewer, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs), Retroviral Genotyping Tools, HIV-1/Human Protein Interaction Database, SAGEmap, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) and the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART). Augmenting many of the Web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized datasets. All of the resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . 
 Eukaryotes produce functionally diverse classes of small RNAs (20–25 nt). These include microRNAs (miRNAs), which act as regulatory factors during growth and development, and short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which function in several epigenetic and post-transcriptional silencing systems. The Arabidopsis Small RNA Project (ASRP) seeks to characterize and functionally analyze the major classes of endogenous small RNAs in plants. The ASRP database provides a repository for sequences of small RNAs cloned from various Arabidopsis genotypes and tissues. Version 3.0 of the database contains 1920 unique sequences, with tools to assist in miRNA and siRNA identification and analysis. The comprehensive database is publicly available through a web interface at http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu . 
 Molecular markers are required in a broad spectrum of gene screening approaches, ranging from gene-mapping within traditional ‘forward’-genetics approaches through QTL identification studies to genotyping and haplotyping studies. As we enter the post-genomics era, the need for genetic markers does not diminish, even in the species with fully sequenced genomes. PlantMarkers is a genetic marker database that contains a comprehensive pool of predicted molecular markers. We have adopted contemporary techniques to identify putative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), simple sequence repeat (SSR) and conserved orthologue set markers. A systematic approach to identify as broad a range of putative markers has been undertaken by screening the available openSputnik unigene consensus sequences from over 50 plant species. A web presence at http://markers.btk.fi provides functionality so that a user may search for species-specific markers on the basis of many specific criteria not limited to non-synonymous SNPs segregating between different varieties or measured polymorphic SSRs. Feedback forms are provided with all sequence entries to enable inclusion of, for example, map location for markers validated by the research community. 
 Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have become a standard tool in functional genomics. Once incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), siRNAs mediate the specific recognition of corresponding target mRNAs and their cleavage. However, only a small fraction of randomly chosen siRNA sequences is able to induce efficient gene silencing. In common laboratory practice, successful RNA interference experiments typically require both, the labour and cost-intensive identification of an active siRNA sequence and the optimization of target cell line-specific procedures for optimal siRNA delivery. To optimize the design and performance of siRNA experiments, we have established the human siRNA database (HuSiDa). The database provides sequences of published functional siRNA molecules targeting human genes and important technical details of the corresponding gene silencing experiments, including the mode of siRNA generation, recipient cell lines, transfection reagents and procedures and direct links to published references (PubMed). The database can be accessed at http://www.human-siRNA-database.net . We used the siRNA sequence information stored in the database for scrutinizing published sequence selection parameters for efficient gene silencing. 
 The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; http://www.yeastgenome.org/ ) is a scientific database of gene, protein and genomic information for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . SGD has recently developed two new resources that facilitate nucleotide and protein sequence comparisons between S.cerevisiae and other organisms. The Fungal BLAST tool provides directed searches against all fungal nucleotide and protein sequences available from GenBank, divided into categories according to organism, status of completeness and annotation, and source. The Model Organism BLASTP Best Hits resource displays, for each S.cerevisiae protein, the single most similar protein from several model organisms and presents links to the database pages of those proteins, facilitating access to curated information about potential orthologs of yeast proteins. 
 The Sting Report is a versatile web-based application for extraction and presentation of detailed information about any individual amino acid of a protein structure stored in the STING Database. The extracted information is presented as a series of GIF images and tables, containing the values of up to 125 sequence/structure/function descriptors/parameters. The GIF images are generated by the Gold STING modules. The HTML page resulting from the STING Report query can be printed and, most importantly, it can be composed and visualized on a computer platform with an elementary configuration. Using the STING Report, a user can generate a collection of customized reports for amino acids of specific interest. Such a collection comes as an ideal match for a demand for the rapid and detailed consultation and documentation of data about structure/function. The inclusion of information generated with STING Report in a research report or even a textbook, allows for the increased density of its contents. STING Report is freely accessible within the Gold STING Suite at http://www.cbi.cnptia.embrapa.br , http://www.es.embnet.org/SMS/ , http://gibk26.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/SMS/ and http://trantor.bioc.columbia.edu/SMS (option: STING Report). 
 Experimental data on the Escherichia coli transcriptional regulatory system has been used in the past years to predict new regulatory elements (promoters, transcription factors (TFs), TFs' binding sites and operons) within its genome. As more genomes of gamma-proteobacteria are being sequenced, the prediction of these elements in a growing number of organisms has become more feasible, as a step towards the study of how different bacteria respond to environmental changes at the level of transcriptional regulation. In this work, we present TRACTOR_DB (TRAnscription FaCTORs' predicted binding sites in prokaryotic genomes), a relational database that contains computational predictions of new members of 74 regulons in 17 gamma-proteobacterial genomes. For these predictions we used a comparative genomics approach regarding which several proof-of-principle articles for large regulons have been published. TRACTOR_DB may be currently accessed at http://www.bioinfo.cu/Tractor_DB , http://www.tractor.lncc.br/ or at http://www.cifn.unam.mx/Computational_Genomics/tractorDB . Contact Email id is tractor@cifn.unam.mx . 
 The Candida Genome Database (CGD) is a new database that contains genomic information about the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans . CGD is a public resource for the research community that is interested in the molecular biology of this fungus. CGD curators are in the process of combing the scientific literature to collect all C.albicans gene names and aliases; to assign gene ontology terms that describe the molecular function, biological process, and subcellular localization of each gene product; to annotate mutant phenotypes; and to summarize the function and biological context of each gene product in free-text description lines. CGD also provides community resources, including a reservation system for gene names and a colleague registry through which Candida researchers can share contact information and research interests. CGD is publicly funded (by NIH grant R01 DE15873-01 from the NIDCR) and is freely available at http://www.candidagenome.org/ . 
 The Small Subunit rRNA Modification Database provides a listing of reported post-transcriptionally modified nucleosides and sequence sites in small subunit rRNAs from bacteria, archaea and eukarya. Data are compiled from reports of full or partial rRNA sequences, including RNase T1 oligonucleotide catalogs reported in earlier literature in studies of phylogenetic relatedness. Options for data presentation include full sequence maps, some of which have been assembled by database curators with the aid of contemporary gene sequence data, and tabular forms organized by source organism or chemical identity of the modification. A total of 32 rRNA sequence alignments are provided, annotated with sites of modification and chemical identities of modifications if known, with provision for scrolling full sequences or user-dictated subsequences for comparative viewing for organisms of interest. The database can be accessed through the World Wide Web at http://medlib.med.utah.edu/SSUmods . 
 The Inparanoid eukaryotic ortholog database ( http://inparanoid.cgb.ki.se/ ) is a collection of pairwise ortholog groups between 17 whole genomes; Anopheles gambiae , Caenorhabditis briggsae , Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila melanogaster , Danio rerio , Takifugu rubripes , Gallus gallus , Homo sapiens , Mus musculus , Pan troglodytes , Rattus norvegicus , Oryza sativa , Plasmodium falciparum , Arabidopsis thaliana , Escherichia coli , Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Complete proteomes for these genomes were derived from Ensembl and UniProt and compared pairwise using Blast, followed by a clustering step using the Inparanoid program. An Inparanoid cluster is seeded by a reciprocally best-matching ortholog pair, around which inparalogs (should they exist) are gathered independently, while outparalogs are excluded. The ortholog clusters can be searched on the website using Ensembl gene/protein or UniProt identifiers, annotation text or by Blast alignment against our protein datasets. The entire dataset can be downloaded, as can the Inparanoid program itself. 
 Metagrowth is a new type of knowledge base developed to guide the experimental studies of culture conditions of obligate parasitic bacteria. We have gathered biological evidences giving possible clues to the development of the axenic (i.e. ‘cell-free’) growth of obligate parasites from various sources including published literature, genomic sequence information, metabolic databases and transporter databases. The database entries are composed of those evidences and specific hypotheses derived from them. Currently, 200 entries are available for Rickettsia prowazekii , Rickettsia conorii , Tropheryma whipplei , Treponema pallidum , Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Coxiella burnetii . The web interface of Metagrowth helps users to design new axenic culture media eventually suitable for those bacteria. Metagrowth is accessible at http://igs-server.cnrs-mrs.fr/axenic/ . 
 Integr8 is a new web portal for exploring the biology of organisms with completely deciphered genomes. For over 190 species, Integr8 provides access to general information, recent publications, and a detailed statistical overview of the genome and proteome of the organism. The preparation of this analysis is supported through Genome Reviews, a new database of bacterial and archaeal DNA sequences in which annotation has been upgraded (compared to the original submission) through the integration of data from many sources, including the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database, the UniProt Knowledgebase, InterPro, CluSTr, GOA and HOGENOM. Integr8 also allows the users to customize their own interactive analysis, and to download both customized and prepared datasets for their own use. Integr8 is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/integr8 . 
 Rfam is a comprehensive collection of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) families, represented by multiple sequence alignments and profile stochastic context-free grammars. Rfam aims to facilitate the identification and classification of new members of known sequence families, and distributes annotation of ncRNAs in over 200 complete genome sequences. The data provide the first glimpses of conservation of multiple ncRNA families across a wide taxonomic range. A small number of large families are essential in all three kingdoms of life, with large numbers of smaller families specific to certain taxa. Recent improvements in the database are discussed, together with challenges for the future. Rfam is available on the Web at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/ and http://rfam.wustl.edu/ . 
 PANTHER is a large collection of protein families that have been subdivided into functionally related subfamilies, using human expertise. These subfamilies model the divergence of specific functions within protein families, allowing more accurate association with function (ontology terms and pathways), as well as inference of amino acids important for functional specificity. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are built for each family and subfamily for classifying additional protein sequences. The latest version, 5.0, contains 6683 protein families, divided into 31 705 subfamilies, covering ∼90% of mammalian protein-coding genes. PANTHER 5.0 includes a number of significant improvements over previous versions, most notably (i) representation of pathways (primarily signaling pathways) and association with subfamilies and individual protein sequences; (ii) an improved methodology for defining the PANTHER families and subfamilies, and for building the HMMs; (iii) resources for scoring sequences against PANTHER HMMs both over the web and locally; and (iv) a number of new web resources to facilitate analysis of large gene lists, including data generated from high-throughput expression experiments. Efforts are underway to add PANTHER to the InterPro suite of databases, and to make PANTHER consistent with the PIRSF database. PANTHER is now publicly available without restriction at http://panther.appliedbiosystems.com . 
 DoOP ( http://doop.abc.hu/ ) is a database of eukaryotic promoter sequences (upstream regions) aiming to facilitate the recognition of regulatory sites conserved between species. The annotated first exons of human and Arabidopsis thaliana genes were used as queries in BLAST searches to collect the most closely related orthologous first exon sequences from Chordata and Viridiplantae species. Up to 3000 bp DNA segments upstream from these first exons constitute the clusters in the chordate and plant sections of the Database of Orthologous Promoters. Release 1.0 of DoOP contains 21 061 chordate clusters from 284 different species and 7548 plant clusters from 269 different species. The database can be used to find and retrieve promoter sequences of a given gene from various species and it is also suitable to see the most trivial conserved sequence blocks in the orthologous upstream regions. Users can search DoOP with either sequence or text (annotation) to find promoter clusters of various genes. In addition to the sequence data, the positions of the conserved sequence blocks derived from multiple alignments, the positions of repetitive elements and the positions of transcription start sites known from the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) can be viewed graphically. 
 MITOMAP ( http://www.MITOMAP.org ), a database for the human mitochondrial genome, has grown rapidly in data content over the past several years as interest in the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in human origins, forensics, degenerative diseases, cancer and aging has increased dramatically. To accommodate this information explosion, MITOMAP has implemented a new relational database and an improved search engine, and all programs have been rewritten. System administrative changes have been made to improve security and efficiency, and to make MITOMAP compatible with a new automatic mtDNA sequence analyzer known as Mitomaster. 
 We used the Automatic Domain Decomposition Algorithm (ADDA) to generate a database of protein domain families with complete coverage of all protein sequences. Sequences are split into domains and domains are grouped into protein domain families in a completely automated process. The current database contains domains for more than 1.5 million sequences in more than 40 000 domain families. In particular, there are 3828 novel domain families that do not overlap with the curated domain databases Pfam, SCOP and InterPro. The data are freely available for downloading and querying via a web interface ( http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi:9801/sqgraph/pairsdb ). 
 The EzCatDB (Enzyme Catalytic-mechanism Database) specifically includes catalytic mechanisms of enzymes in terms of sequences and tertiary structures of enzymes, and proposed catalytic mechanisms, along with ligand structures. The EzCatDB groups enzyme data in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the SWISS-PROT database with identical domain compositions, Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and catalytic mechanisms. The EzCatDB can be queried by the type of catalytic residue, name and type of ligand molecule that interacts with an enzyme as a cofactor, substrate or product. It can provide literature information, other database codes and EC numbers. The EzCatDB provides ligand annotation for enzymes in the PDB as well as literature information on structure and catalytic mechanisms. Furthermore, the EzCatDB also provides a hierarchic classification of catalytic mechanisms. This classification incorporates catalytic mechanisms and active-site structures of enzymes as well as basic reactions and reactive parts of ligand molecules. The EzCatDB is available at http://mbs.cbrc.jp/EzCatDB/ . 
 The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP-II) provides the research community with aligned and annotated rRNA gene sequences, along with analysis services and a phylogenetically consistent taxonomic framework for these data. Updated monthly, these services are made available through the RDP-II website ( http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/ ). RDP-II release 9.21 (August 2004) contains 101 632 bacterial small subunit rRNA gene sequences in aligned and annotated format. High-throughput tools for initial taxonomic placement, identification of related sequences, probe and primer testing, data navigation and subalignment download are provided. The RDP-II email address for questions or comments is rdpstaff@msu.edu . 
 InterPro, an integrated documentation resource of protein families, domains and functional sites, was created to integrate the major protein signature databases. Currently, it includes PROSITE, Pfam, PRINTS, ProDom, SMART, TIGRFAMs, PIRSF and SUPERFAMILY. Signatures are manually integrated into InterPro entries that are curated to provide biological and functional information. Annotation is provided in an abstract, Gene Ontology mapping and links to specialized databases. New features of InterPro include extended protein match views, taxonomic range information and protein 3D structure data. One of the new match views is the InterPro Domain Architecture view, which shows the domain composition of protein matches. Two new entry types were introduced to better describe InterPro entries: these are active site and binding site. PIRSF and the structure-based SUPERFAMILY are the latest member databases to join InterPro, and CATH and PANTHER are soon to be integrated. InterPro release 8.0 contains 11 007 entries, representing 2573 domains, 8166 families, 201 repeats, 26 active sites, 21 binding sites and 20 post-translational modification sites. InterPro covers over 78% of all proteins in the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL components of UniProt. The database is available for text- and sequence-based searches via a webserver ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro ), and for download by anonymous FTP ( ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/interpro ). 
 S4 is an automatically generated database of multiple structure-based sequence alignments of protein superfamilies in the SCOP database. All structural domains that do not share more than 40% sequence identity as defined by the ASTRAL compendium of protein structures are included. The alignments are constructed using pairwise structural alignments to generate residue equivalences that are then integrated into multiple alignments using sequence alignment tools. We describe the database and give examples showing how the automatically generated S4 alignments compare favourably to hand-crafted alignments. Available at: http://compbio.mds.qmw.ac.uk/S4.html . 
 The RIKEN Arabidopsis Genome Encyclopedia (RARGE) database houses information on biological resources ranging from transcriptome to phenome, including RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length (RAFL) complementary DNAs (cDNAs), their promoter regions, Dissociation ( Ds ) transposon-tagged lines and expression data from microarray experiments. RARGE provides tools for searching by resource code, sequence homology or keyword, and rapid access to detailed information on the resources. We have isolated 245 946 RAFL cDNA clones and collected 11 933 transposon-tagged lines, which are available from the RIKEN Bioresource Center and are stored in RARGE. The RARGE web interface can be accessed at http://rarge.gsc.riken.jp/ . Additionally, we report 90 000 new RAFL cDNA clones here. 
 PDB_TM is a database for transmembrane proteins with known structures. It aims to collect all transmembrane proteins that are deposited in the protein structure database (PDB) and to determine their membrane-spanning regions. These assignments are based on the TMDET algorithm, which uses only structural information to locate the most likely position of the lipid bilayer and to distinguish between transmembrane and globular proteins. This algorithm was applied to all PDB entries and the results were collected in the PDB_TM database. By using TMDET algorithm, the PDB_TM database can be automatically updated every week, keeping it synchronized with the latest PDB updates. The PDB_TM database is available at http://www.enzim.hu/PDB_TM . 
 The Poxvirus Bioinformatics Resource Center (PBRC) has been established to provide informational and analytical resources to the scientific community to aid research directed at providing a better understanding of the Poxviridae family of viruses. The PBRC was specifically established as the result of the concern that variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, as well as related viruses, might be utilized as biological weapons. In addition, the PBRC supports research on poxviruses that might be considered new and emerging infectious agents such as monkeypox virus. The PBRC consists of a relational database and web application that supports the data storage, annotation, analysis and information exchange goals of the project. The current release consists of over 35 complete genomic sequences of various genera, species and strains of viruses from the Poxviridae family. Sequence and annotation information for these viruses has been obtained from sequences publicly available from GenBank as well as sequences not yet deposited in GenBank that have been obtained from ongoing sequencing projects. In addition to sequence data, the PBRC provides comprehensive annotation and curation of virus genes; analytical tools to aid in the understanding of the available sequence data, including tools for the comparative analysis of different virus isolates; and visualization tools to help better display the results of various analyses. The PBRC represents the initial development of what will become a more comprehensive Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center for Biodefense that will be one of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' ‘Bioinformatics Resource Centers for Biodefense and Emerging or Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases’. The PBRC website is available at http://www.poxvirus.org . 
 Messenger RNA polyadenylation is one of the key post-transcriptional events in eukaryotic cells. A large number of genes in mammalian species can undergo alternative polyadenylation, which leads to mRNAs with variable 3′ ends. As the 3′ end of mRNAs often contains cis elements important for mRNA stability, mRNA localization and translation, the implications of the regulation of polyadenylation can be multifold. Alternative polyadenylation is controlled by cis elements and trans factors, and is believed to occur in a tissue- or disease-specific manner. Given the availability of many databases devoted to other aspects of mRNA metabolism, such as transcriptional initiation and splicing, systematic information on polyadenylation, including alternative polyadenylation and its regulation, is noticeably lacking. Here, we present a database named polyA_DB, through which we strive to provide several types of information regarding polyadenylation in mammalian species: (i) polyadenylation sites and their locations with respect to the genomic structure of genes; (ii) cis elements surrounding polyadenylation sites; (iii) comparison of polyadenylation configuration between orthologous genes; and (iv) tissue/organ information for alternative polyadenylation sites. Currently, polyA_DB contains 45 565 polyadenylation sites for 25 097 human and mouse genes, representing the most comprehensive polyadenylation database till date. The database is accessible via the website ( http://polya.umdnj.edu/polyadb ). 
 The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is the largest fully public repository for high-throughput molecular abundance data, primarily gene expression data. The database has a flexible and open design that allows the submission, storage and retrieval of many data types. These data include microarray-based experiments measuring the abundance of mRNA, genomic DNA and protein molecules, as well as non-array-based technologies such as serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and mass spectrometry proteomic technology. GEO currently holds over 30 000 submissions representing approximately half a billion individual molecular abundance measurements, for over 100 organisms. Here, we describe recent database developments that facilitate effective mining and visualization of these data. Features are provided to examine data from both experiment- and gene-centric perspectives using user-friendly Web-based interfaces accessible to those without computational or microarray-related analytical expertise. The GEO database is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo . 
 BacMap is an interactive visual database containing fully labeled, zoomable and searchable chromosome maps from more than 170 bacterial (archaebacterial and eubacterial) species. It uses a recently developed visualization tool (CGView) to generate high-resolution circular genome maps from sequence feature information. Each map includes an interface that allows the image to be expanded and rotated. In the default view, identified genes are drawn to scale and colored according to coding directions. When a region of interest is expanded, gene labels are displayed. Each label is hyperlinked to a custom ‘gene card’ which provides several fields of information concerning the corresponding DNA and protein sequences. Each genome map is searchable via a local BLAST search and a gene name/synonym search. BacMap is freely available at http://wishart.biology.ualberta.ca/BacMap/ . 
 Ciliated protozoa have two kinds of nuclei: Macronuclei (MAC) and Micronuclei (MIC). In some ciliate classes, such as spirotrichs, most genes undergo several layers of DNA rearrangement during macronuclear development. Because of such processes, these organisms provide ideal systems for studying mechanisms of recombination and gene rearrangement. Here, we describe a database that contains all spirotrich genes for which both MAC and MIC versions are sequenced, with consistent annotation and easy access to all the features. An interface to query the database is available at http://oxytricha.princeton.edu/dimorphism/database.htm . 
 GenBank ® is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available DNA sequences for more than 165 000 named organisms, obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank staff upon receipt. Daily data exchange with the EMBL Data Library in the UK and the DNA Data Bank of Japan helps to ensure worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through NCBI's retrieval system, Entrez, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. To access GenBank and its related retrieval and analysis services, go to the NCBI Homepage at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . 
 The rapid recent evolution of the field phenomics—the genome-wide study of gene dispensability by quantitative analysis of phenotypes—has resulted in an increasing demand for new data analysis and visualization tools. Following the introduction of a novel approach for precise, genome-wide quantification of gene dispensability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae we here announce a public resource for mining, filtering and visualizing phenotypic data—the PROPHECY database. PROPHECY is designed to allow easy and flexible access to physiologically relevant quantitative data for the growth behaviour of mutant strains in the yeast deletion collection during conditions of environmental challenges. PROPHECY is publicly accessible at http://prophecy.lundberg.gu.se . 
 ProDom is a comprehensive database of protein domain families generated from the global comparison of all available protein sequences. Recent improvements include the use of three-dimensional (3D) information from the SCOP database; a completely redesigned web interface ( http://www.toulouse.inra.fr/prodom.html ); visualization of ProDom domains on 3D structures; coupling of ProDom analysis with the Geno3D homology modelling server; Bayesian inference of evolutionary scenarios for ProDom families. In addition, we have developed ProDom-SG, a ProDom-based server dedicated to the selection of candidate proteins for structural genomics. 
 A database for potato genome data (PoMaMo, Potato Maps and More) was established. The database contains molecular maps of all twelve potato chromosomes with about 1000 mapped elements, sequence data, putative gene functions, results from BLAST analysis, SNP and InDel information from different diploid and tetraploid potato genotypes, publication references, links to other public databases like GenBank ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) or SGN (Solanaceae Genomics Network, http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/ ), etc. Flexible search and data visualization interfaces enable easy access to the data via internet ( https://gabi.rzpd.de/PoMaMo.html ). The Java servlet tool YAMB (Yet Another Map Browser) was designed to interactively display chromosomal maps. Maps can be zoomed in and out, and detailed information about mapped elements can be obtained by clicking on an element of interest. The GreenCards interface allows a text-based data search by marker-, sequence- or genotype name, by sequence accession number, gene function, BLAST Hit or publication reference. The PoMaMo database is a comprehensive database for different potato genome data, and to date the only database containing SNP and InDel data from diploid and tetraploid potato genotypes. 
 PDB-Ligand ( http://www.idrtech.com/PDB-Ligand/ ) is a three-dimensional structure database of small molecular ligands that are bound to larger biomolecules deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It is also a database tool that allows one to browse, classify, superimpose and visualize these structures. As of May 2004, there are about 4870 types of small molecular ligands, experimentally determined as a complex with protein or DNA in the PDB. The proteins that a given ligand binds are often homologous and present the same binding structure to the ligand. However, there are also many instances wherein a given ligand binds to two or more unrelated proteins, or to the same or homologous protein in different binding environments. PDB-Ligand serves as an interactive structural analysis and clustering tool for all the ligand-binding structures in the PDB. PDB-Ligand also provides an easier way to obtain a number of different structure alignments of many related ligand-binding structures based on a simple and flexible ligand clustering method. PDB-Ligand will be a good resource for both a better interpretation of ligand-binding structures and the development of better scoring functions to be used in many drug discovery applications. 
 Gene expression profiling of cancer tissues is expected to contribute to our understanding of cancer biology as well as developments of new methods of diagnosis and therapy. Our collaborative efforts in Japan have been mainly focused on solid tumors such as breast, colorectal and hepatocellular cancers. The expression data are obtained by a high-throughput RT–PCR technique, and patients are recruited mainly from a single hospital. In the cancer gene expression database (CGED), the expression and clinical data are presented in a way useful for scientists interested in specific genes or biological functions. The data can be retrieved either by gene identifiers or by functional categories defined by Gene Ontology terms or the Swiss-Prot annotation. Expression patterns of multiple genes, selected by names or similarity search of the patterns, can be compared. Visual presentation of the data with sorting function enables users to easily recognize of relationships between gene expression and clinical parameters. Data for other cancers such as lung and thyroid cancers will be added in the near future. The URL of CGED is http://cged.hgc.jp . 
 The Arabidopsis Nucleolar Protein Database ( http://bioinf.scri.sari.ac.uk/cgi-bin/atnopdb/home ) provides information on 217 proteins identified in a proteomic analysis of nucleoli isolated from Arabidopsis cell culture. The database is organized on the basis of the Arabidopsis gene identifier number. The information provided includes protein description, protein class, whether or not the plant protein has a homologue in the most recent human nucleolar proteome and the results of reciprocal BLAST analysis of the human proteome. In addition, for one-third of the 217 Arabidopsis nucleolar proteins, localization images are available from analysis of full-length cDNA–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions and the strength of signal in different parts of the cell—nucleolus, nucleolus-associated structures, nucleoplasm, nuclear bodies and extra-nuclear—is provided. For each protein, the most likely human and yeast orthologues, where identifiable through BLASTX analysis, are given with links to relevant information sources. 
 A full description of a protein's function requires knowledge of all partner proteins with which it specifically associates. From a functional perspective, ‘association’ can mean direct physical binding, but can also mean indirect interaction such as participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular process. Currently, information about protein association is scattered over a wide variety of resources and model organisms. STRING aims to simplify access to this information by providing a comprehensive, yet quality-controlled collection of protein–protein associations for a large number of organisms. The associations are derived from high-throughput experimental data, from the mining of databases and literature, and from predictions based on genomic context analysis. STRING integrates and ranks these associations by benchmarking them against a common reference set, and presents evidence in a consistent and intuitive web interface. Importantly, the associations are extended beyond the organism in which they were originally described, by automatic transfer to orthologous protein pairs in other organisms, where applicable. STRING currently holds 730 000 proteins in 180 fully sequenced organisms, and is available at http://string.embl.de/ . 
 Knowledge of the 3D structure of glycoproteins and protein–carbohydrate complexes is indispensable to fully understand the biological processes they are involved in. Carbohydrate Structure Suite is an attempt to automatically analyse carbohydrate structures contained in the PDB and make the results publicly available on the internet. Characteristic torsion angles, glycoprotein sequences and carbohydrate–protein interactions are analysed. Furthermore, tools to crosslink the PDB and carbohydrate databases and to check the integrity of carbohydrate 3D structures are included. The service is available at ( www.dkfz.de/spec/css/ ). 
 DynaProt 2D presents an advanced online database for dynamic access to proteomes and two-dimensional (2D) gels. The database was designed to administer complete in silico proteomes and links them with experimental proteomic data in the manner of 2D electrophoresis gels (IPG-Dalt). The 2D gels serve as reference maps in 2D gel analysis as well as tools for navigation of the database to switch between experimental and predicted data. Therefore, all identified spots in the gels are clickable and linked with summarized protein information. The protein information tables contain calculated characteristics, which are often used in proteomics, such as the molecular weight, isoelectric point, codon adaptation index, grand average of hydropathicity, etc. The design of the database permits online extension of gel data and protein attributes without knowledge of any software language. Besides navigation via 2D gels, the clear graphical user interface permits quick and intuitive searching throughout complete proteomes and supports, e.g. the search for proteins with isoelectric points within pH ranges of interest or protein classes (e.g. ribosomal proteins or transporters). The first organism implemented in the database is Lactococcus lactis . The database is available at www.wzw.tum.de/proteomik/lactis . 
 L1Base is a dedicated database containing putatively active LINE-1 (L1) insertions residing in human and rodent genomes that are as follows: (i) intact in the two open reading frames (ORFs), full-length L1s (FLI-L1s) and (ii) intact ORF2 but disrupted ORF1 (ORF2-L1s). In addition, due to their regulatory potential, the full-length (>6000 bp) non-intact L1s (FLnI-L1s) were also included in the database. Application of a novel annotation methodology, L1Xplorer, allowed in-depth annotation of functional sequence features important for L1 activity, such as transcription factor binding sites and amino acid residues. The L1Base is available online at http://l1base.molgen.mpg.de . In addition, the data stored in the database can be accessed from the Ensembl web browser via a DAS service ( http://l1das.molgen.mpg.de:8080/das ). 
 Bioremediation, the exploitation of biological catalysts (mostly microorganisms) for removing pollutants from the environment, requires the integration of huge amounts of data from different sources. We have developed MetaRouter, a system for maintaining heterogeneous information related to bioremediation in a framework that allows its query, administration and mining (application of methods for extracting new knowledge). MetaRouter is an application intended for laboratories working in biodegradation and bioremediation, which need to maintain and consult public and private data, linked internally and with external databases, and to extract new information from it. Among the data-mining features is a program included for locating biodegradative pathways for chemical compounds according to a given set of constraints and requirements. The integration of biodegradation information with the corresponding protein and genome data provides a suitable framework for studying the global properties of the bioremediation network. The system can be accessed and administrated through a web interface. The full-featured system (except administration facilities) is freely available at http://pdg.cnb.uam.es/MetaRouter . Additional material: http://www.pdg.cnb.uam.es/biodeg_net/MetaRouter . 
 Several proteins that have substantially diverged during evolution retain similar three-dimensional structures and biological function inspite of poor sequence identity. The database on Genomic Distribution of protein structural domain Superfamilies (GenDiS) provides record for the distribution of 4001 protein domains organized as 1194 structural superfamilies across 18 997 genomes at various levels of hierarchy in taxonomy. GenDiS database provides a survey of protein domains enlisted in sequence databases employing a 3-fold sequence search approach. Lineage-specific literature is obtained from the taxonomy database for individual protein members to provide a platform for performing genomic and phyletic studies across organisms. The database documents residual properties and provides alignments for the various superfamily members in genomes, offering insights into the rational design of experiments and for the better understanding of a superfamily. GenDiS database can be accessed at http://www.ncbs.res.in/~faculty/mini/gendis/home.html . 
 PRECISE (Predicted and Consensus Interaction Sites in Enzymes) is a database of interactions between the amino acid residues of an enzyme and its ligands (substrate and transition state analogs, cofactors, inhibitors and products). It is available online at http://precise.bu.edu/ . In the current version, all information on interactions is extracted from the enzyme–ligand complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) by performing the following steps: (i) clustering homologous enzyme chains such that, in each cluster, the proteins have the same EC number and all sequences are similar; (ii) selecting a representative chain for each cluster; (iii) selecting ligand types; (iv) finding non-bonded interactions and hydrogen bonds; and (v) summing the interactions for all chains within the cluster. The output of the search is the color-coded sequence of the representative. The colors indicate the total number of interactions found at each amino acid position in all chains of the cluster. Clicking on a residue displays a detailed list of interactions for that residue. Optional filters allow restricting the output to selected chains in the cluster, to non-bonded or hydrogen bonding interactions, and to selected ligand types. The binding site information is essential for understanding and altering substrate specificity and for the design of enzyme inhibitors. 
 REBASE is a comprehensive database of information about restriction enzymes, DNA methyltransferases and related proteins involved in restriction–modification. It contains both published and unpublished work with information about recognition and cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, crystal and sequence data. Experimentally characterized homing endonucleases are also included. Additionally, REBASE contains complete and up-to-date information about the methylation sensitivity of restriction endonucleases. An extensive analysis is included of the restriction–modification systems that are predicted to be present in the sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes from GenBank. The contents of REBASE are available by browsing from the web ( http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html ) and through selected compilations by ftp ( ftp.neb.com ) and as monthly updates that can be requested via email. 
 The Ashbya Genome Database (AGD) is a comprehensive online source of information covering genes from the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii . The database content is based upon comparative genome annotation between A.gossypii and the closely related budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae taking both sequence similarity and synteny (conserved order and orientation) into account. Release 2 of AGD contains 4718 protein-encoding loci located across seven chromosomes. Information can be retrieved using systematic or standard locus names from A.gossypii as well as budding and fission yeast. Approximately 90% of the genes in the genome of A.gossypii are homologous and syntenic to loci of budding yeast. Therefore, AGD is a useful tool not only for the various yeast communities in general but also for biologists who are interested in evolutionary aspects of genome research and comparative genome annotation. The database provides scientists with a convenient graphical user interface that includes various locus search and genome browsing options, data download and export functionalities and numerous reciprocal links to external databases including SGD, MIPS, GeneDB, KEGG, GermOnline and Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL. AGD is accessible at http://agd.unibas.ch/ . 
 The Arabidopsis Mitochondrial Protein Database is an Internet-accessible relational database containing information on the predicted and experimentally confirmed protein complement of mitochondria from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana ( http://www.ampdb.bcs.uwa.edu.au/ ). The database was formed using the total non-redundant nuclear and organelle encoded sets of protein sequences and allows relational searching of published proteomic analyses of Arabidopsis mitochondrial samples, a set of predictions from six independent subcellular-targeting prediction programs, and orthology predictions based on pairwise comparison of the Arabidopsis protein set with known yeast and human mitochondrial proteins and with the proteome of Rickettsia. A variety of precomputed physical–biochemical parameters are also searchable as well as a more detailed breakdown of mass spectral data produced from our proteomic analysis of Arabidopsis mitochondria. It contains hyperlinks to other Arabidopsis genomic resources (MIPS, TIGR and TAIR), which provide rapid access to changing gene models as well as hyperlinks to T-DNA insertion resources, Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) and Genome Tiling Array data and a variety of other Arabidopsis online resources. It also incorporates basic analysis tools built into the query structure such as a BLAST facility and tools for protein sequence alignments for convenient analysis of queried results. 
 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM™) is a comprehensive, authoritative and timely knowledgebase of human genes and genetic disorders compiled to support human genetics research and education and the practice of clinical genetics. Started by Dr Victor A. McKusick as the definitive reference Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/ ) is now distributed electronically by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, where it is integrated with the Entrez suite of databases. Derived from the biomedical literature, OMIM is written and edited at Johns Hopkins University with input from scientists and physicians around the world. Each OMIM entry has a full-text summary of a genetically determined phenotype and/or gene and has numerous links to other genetic databases such as DNA and protein sequence, PubMed references, general and locus-specific mutation databases, HUGO nomenclature, MapViewer, GeneTests, patient support groups and many others. OMIM is an easy and straightforward portal to the burgeoning information in human genetics. 
 Although the list of completed genome sequencing projects has expanded rapidly, sequencing and analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) remain a primary tool for discovery of novel genes in many eukaryotes and a key element in genome annotation. The TIGR Gene Indices ( http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi ) are a collection of 77 species-specific databases that use a highly refined protocol to analyze gene and EST sequences in an attempt to identify and characterize expressed transcripts and to present them on the Web in a user-friendly, consistent fashion. A Gene Index database is constructed for each selected organism by first clustering, then assembling EST and annotated cDNA and gene sequences from GenBank. This process produces a set of unique, high-fidelity virtual transcripts, or tentative consensus (TC) sequences. The TC sequences can be used to provide putative genes with functional annotation, to link the transcripts to genetic and physical maps, to provide links to orthologous and paralogous genes, and as a resource for comparative and functional genomic analysis. 
 The Diatom EST database provides integrated access to expressed sequence tag (EST) data from two eukaryotic microalgae of the class Bacillariophyceae, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana . The database currently contains sequences of close to 30 000 ESTs organized into PtDB, the P.tricornutum EST database, and TpDB, the T.pseudonana EST database. The EST sequences were clustered and assembled into a non-redundant set for each organism, and these non-redundant sequences were then subjected to automated annotation using similarity searches against protein and domain databases. EST sequences, clusters of contiguous sequences, their annotation and analysis with reference to the publicly available databases, and a codon usage table derived from a subset of sequences from PtDB and TpDB can all be accessed in the Diatom EST Database. The underlying RDBMS enables queries over the raw and annotated EST data and retrieval of information through a user-friendly web interface, with options to perform keyword and BLAST searches. The EST data can also be retrieved based on Pfam domains, Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) and Gene Ontologies (GO) assigned to them by similarity searches. The Database is available at http://avesthagen.sznbowler.com . 
 Reactome, located at http://www.reactome.org is a curated, peer-reviewed resource of human biological processes. Given the genetic makeup of an organism, the complete set of possible reactions constitutes its reactome. The basic unit of the Reactome database is a reaction; reactions are then grouped into causal chains to form pathways. The Reactome data model allows us to represent many diverse processes in the human system, including the pathways of intermediary metabolism, regulatory pathways, and signal transduction, and high-level processes, such as the cell cycle. Reactome provides a qualitative framework, on which quantitative data can be superimposed. Tools have been developed to facilitate custom data entry and annotation by expert biologists, and to allow visualization and exploration of the finished dataset as an interactive process map. Although our primary curational domain is pathways from Homo sapiens , we regularly create electronic projections of human pathways onto other organisms via putative orthologs, thus making Reactome relevant to model organism research communities. The database is publicly available under open source terms, which allows both its content and its software infrastructure to be freely used and redistributed. 
 Longer words and phrases are frequently mapped onto a shorter form such as abbreviations or acronyms for efficiency of communication. These abbreviations are pervasive in all aspects of biology and medicine and as the amount of biomedical literature grows, so does the number of abbreviations and the average number of definitions per abbreviation. Even more confusing, different authors will often abbreviate the same word/phrase differently. This ambiguity impedes our ability to retrieve information, integrate databases and mine textual databases for content. Efforts to standardize nomenclature, especially those doing so retrospectively, need to be aware of different abbreviatory mappings and spelling variations. To address this problem, there have been several efforts to develop computer algorithms to identify the mapping of terms between short and long form within a large body of literature. To date, four such algorithms have been applied to create online databases that comprehensively map biomedical terms and abbreviations within MEDLINE: ARGH ( http://lethargy.swmed.edu/ARGH/argh.asp ), the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server ( http://bionlp.stanford.edu/abbreviation/ ), AcroMed ( http://medstract.med.tufts.edu/acro1.1/index.htm ) and SaRAD ( http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/projects/abbrev.html ). In addition to serving as useful computational tools, these databases serve as valuable references that help biologists keep up with an ever-expanding vocabulary of terms. 
 The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/ ) provides a non-redundant collection of sequences representing genomic data, transcripts and proteins. Although the goal is to provide a comprehensive dataset representing the complete sequence information for any given species, the database pragmatically includes sequence data that are currently publicly available in the archival databases. The database incorporates data from over 2400 organisms and includes over one million proteins representing significant taxonomic diversity spanning prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses. Nucleotide and protein sequences are explicitly linked, and the sequences are linked to other resources including the NCBI Map Viewer and Gene. Sequences are annotated to include coding regions, conserved domains, variation, references, names, database cross-references, and other features using a combined approach of collaboration and other input from the scientific community, automated annotation, propagation from GenBank and curation by NCBI staff. 
 The CATH database of protein domain structures ( http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath/ ) currently contains 43 229 domains classified into 1467 superfamilies and 5107 sequence families. Each structural family is expanded with sequence relatives from GenBank and completed genomes, using a variety of efficient sequence search protocols and reliable thresholds. This extended CATH protein family database contains 616 470 domain sequences classified into 23 876 sequence families. This results in the significant expansion of the CATH HMM model library to include models built from the CATH sequence relatives, giving a 10% increase in coverage for detecting remote homologues. An improved Dictionary of Homologous superfamilies (DHS) ( http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dhs/ ) containing specific sequence, structural and functional information for each superfamily in CATH considerably assists manual validation of homologues. Information on sequence relatives in CATH superfamilies, GenBank and completed genomes is presented in the CATH associated DHS and Gene3D resources. Domain partnership information can be obtained from Gene3D ( http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath/Gene3D/ ). A new CATH server has been implemented ( http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cath/CathServer.pl ) providing automatic classification of newly determined sequences and structures using a suite of rapid sequence and structure comparison methods. The statistical significance of matches is assessed and links are provided to the putative superfamily or fold group to which the query sequence or structure is assigned. 
 The Yeast Resource Center Public Data Repository (YRC PDR) serves as a single point of access for the experimental data produced from many collaborations typically studying Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). The experimental data include large amounts of mass spectrometry results from protein co-purification experiments, yeast two-hybrid interaction experiments, fluorescence microscopy images and protein structure predictions. All of the data are accessible via searching by gene or protein name, and are available on the Web at http://www.yeastrc.org/pdr/ . 
 Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are a popular method for gene-knockdown, acting by degrading the target mRNA. Before performing experiments it is invaluable to locate and evaluate previous knockdown experiments for the gene of interest. The siRNA database provides a gene-centric view of siRNA experimental data, including siRNAs of known efficacy and siRNAs predicted to be of high efficacy by a combination of methods. Linked to these sequences is information such as siRNA thermodynamic properties and the potential for sequence-specific off-target effects. The database enables the user to evaluate an siRNA's potential for inhibition and non-specific effects. The database is available at http://siRNA.cgb.ki.se . 
 The international ImMunoGeneTics information system ® (IMGT) ( http://imgt.cines.fr ), created in 1989, by the Laboratoire d'ImmunoGénétique Moléculaire LIGM (Université Montpellier II and CNRS) at Montpellier, France, is a high-quality integrated knowledge resource specializing in the immunoglobulins (IGs), T cell receptors (TRs), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of human and other vertebrates, and related proteins of the immune systems (RPI) that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and to the MHC superfamily (MhcSF). IMGT includes several sequence databases (IMGT/LIGM-DB, IMGT/PRIMER-DB, IMGT/PROTEIN-DB and IMGT/MHC-DB), one genome database (IMGT/GENE-DB) and one three-dimensional (3D) structure database (IMGT/3Dstructure-DB), Web resources comprising 8000 HTML pages (IMGT Marie-Paule page), and interactive tools. IMGT data are expertly annotated according to the rules of the IMGT Scientific chart, based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts. IMGT tools are particularly useful for the analysis of the IG and TR repertoires in normal physiological and pathological situations. IMGT is used in medical research (autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, AIDS, leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas), veterinary research, biotechnology related to antibody engineering (phage displays, combinatorial libraries, chimeric, humanized and human antibodies), diagnostics (clonalities, detection and follow up of residual diseases) and therapeutical approaches (graft, immunotherapy and vaccinology). IMGT is freely available at http://imgt.cines.fr . 
 PA-GOSUB (Proteome Analyst: Gene Ontology Molecular Function and Subcellular Localization) is a publicly available, web-based, searchable and downloadable database that contains the sequences, predicted GO molecular functions and predicted subcellular localizations of more than 107 000 proteins from 10 model organisms (and growing), covering the major kingdoms and phyla for which annotated proteomes exist ( http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~bioinfo/PA/GOSUB ). The PA-GOSUB database effectively expands the coverage of subcellular localization and GO function annotations by a significant factor (already over five for subcellular localization, compared with Swiss-Prot v42.7), and more model organisms are being added to PA-GOSUB as their sequenced proteomes become available. PA-GOSUB can be used in three main ways. First, a researcher can browse the pre-computed PA-GOSUB annotations on a per-organism and per-protein basis using annotation-based and text-based filters. Second, a user can perform BLAST searches against the PA-GOSUB database and use the annotations from the homologs as simple predictors for the new sequences. Third, the whole of PA-GOSUB can be downloaded in either FASTA or comma-separated values (CSV) formats. 
 The Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD) ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/ ) is a set of specialist databases related to the study of polymorphic genes in the immune system. IPD currently consists of four databases: IPD-KIR, contains the allelic sequences of Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors; IPD-MHC, a database of sequences of the Major Histocompatibility Complex of different species; IPD-HPA, alloantigens expressed only on platelets; and IPD-ESTAB, which provides access to the European Searchable Tumour Cell-Line Database, a cell bank of immunologically characterized melanoma cell lines. The IPD project works with specialist groups or nomenclature committees who provide and curate individual sections before they are submitted to IPD for online publication. The IPD project stores all the data in a set of related databases. Those sections with similar data, such as IPD-KIR and IPD-MHC share the same database structure. The sharing of a common database structure makes it easier to implement common tools for data submission and retrieval. The data are currently available online from the website and ftp directory; files will also be made available in different formats to download from the website and ftp server. The data will also be included in SRS, BLAST and FASTA search engines at the European Bioinformatics Institute. 
 Nucleosome Positioning Region Database (NPRD), which is compiling the available experimental data on locations and characteristics of nucleosome formation sites (NFSs), is the first curated NFS-oriented database. The object of the database is a single NFS described in an individual entry. When annotating results of NFS experimental mapping, we pay special attention to several important functional characteristics, such as the relationship between type of gene activity and nucleosome positioning, the influence of non-histone proteins on nucleosome formation, type of the variant of nucleosome positioning (translational or rotational), indication of tissue types and states of cell activity, description of experimental methods used and accuracy of nucleosome position determination, and the results of applying theoretical and computer methods to the analysis of contextual and conformational DNA properties. At present, the NPRD database contains 438 entries and integrates the data described in 124 original papers. The database URL: http://srs6.bionet.nsc.ru/srs6/ . Then click the button ‘Databank’ and open the link NUCLEOSOME. 
 Bacterial pathogens continue to impose a major threat to public health worldwide in the 21st century. Intensified studies on bacterial pathogenesis have greatly expanded our knowledge about the mechanisms of the disease processes at the molecular level over the last decades. To facilitate future research, it becomes necessary to form a database collectively presenting the virulence factors (VFs) of various medical significant bacterial pathogens. The aim of virulence factor database (VFDB) ( http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/ ) is to provide such a source for scientists to rapidly access to current knowledge about VFs from various bacterial pathogens. VFDB is comprehensive and user-friendly. One can search VFDB by browsing each genus or by typing keywords. Furthermore, a BLAST search tool against all known VF-related genes is also available. VFDB provides a unified gateway to store, search, retrieve and update information about VFs from various bacterial pathogens. 
Echo BASE ( http://www.ecoli-york.org ) is a relational database designed to contain and manipulate information from post-genomic experiments using the model bacterium Escherichia coli K-12. Its aim is to collate information from a wide range of sources to provide clues to the functions of the approximately 1500 gene products that have no confirmed cellular function. The database is built on an enhanced annotation of the updated genome sequence of strain MG1655 and the association of experimental data with the E.coli genes and their products. Experiments that can be held within Echo BASE include proteomics studies, microarray data, protein–protein interaction data, structural data and bioinformatics studies. Echo BASE also contains annotated information on ‘orphan’ enzyme activities from this microbe to aid characterization of the proteins that catalyse these elusive biochemical reactions. 
 From 138 662 embryophyte (higher plant) and 348 142 chordate genes, 4216 embryophyte and 15 452 chordate gene families were generated. For each of these gene families, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates ( Ka / Ks ), mappings from gene trees to the NCBI taxonomy and structural links to solved three-dimensional protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with Grantham-weighted mutational factors were all calculated. Of the ‘gene family trees’, 173 embryophyte and 505 chordate branches show Ka / Ks ≫ 1 and are candidates for functional adaptation. The calculated information is available both as a gene family database and as a phylogenetically indexed resource, called ‘The Adaptive Evolution Database’ (TAED), available at http://www.bioinfo.no/tools/TAED . 
 The Conserved Domain Database (CDD) is the protein classification component of NCBI's Entrez query and retrieval system. CDD is linked to other Entrez databases such as Proteins, Taxonomy and PubMed®, and can be accessed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=cdd . CD-Search, which is available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi , is a fast, interactive tool to identify conserved domains in new protein sequences. CD-Search results for protein sequences in Entrez are pre-computed to provide links between proteins and domain models, and computational annotation visible upon request. Protein–protein queries submitted to NCBI's BLAST search service at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST are scanned for the presence of conserved domains by default. While CDD started out as essentially a mirror of publicly available domain alignment collections, such as SMART, Pfam and COG, we have continued an effort to update, and in some cases replace these models with domain hierarchies curated at the NCBI. Here, we report on the progress of the curation effort and associated improvements in the functionality of the CDD information retrieval system. 
 Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are an increasingly important tool for genetic and biomedical research. However, the accumulated sequence information on allelic variation is not matched by an understanding of the effect of SNPs on the functional attributes or ‘molecular phenotype’ of a protein. Towards this aim we developed SNPeffect, an online resource of human non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) mapping phenotypic effects of allelic variation in human genes. SNPeffect contains 31 659 nsSNPs from 12 480 human proteins. The current release of SNPeffect incorporates data on protein stability, integrity of functional sites, protein phosphorylation and glycosylation, subcellular localization, protein turnover rates, protein aggregation, amyloidosis and chaperone interaction. The SNP entries are accessible through both a search and browse interface and are linked to most major biological databases. The data can be displayed as detailed descriptions of individual SNPs or as an overview of all SNPs for a given protein. SNPeffect will be regularly updated and can be accessed at http://snpeffect.vib.be/ . 
 The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Proteome Browser provides a wealth of protein information presented in graphical images and with links to other protein-related Internet sites. The Proteome Browser is tightly integrated with the UCSC Genome Browser. For the first time, Genome Browser users have both the genome and proteome worlds at their fingertips simultaneously. The Proteome Browser displays tracks of protein and genomic sequences, exon structure, polarity, hydrophobicity, locations of cysteine and glycosylation potential, Superfamily domains and amino acids that deviate from normal abundance. Histograms show genome-wide distribution of protein properties, including isoelectric point, molecular weight, number of exons, InterPro domains and cysteine locations, together with specific property values of the selected protein. The Proteome Browser also provides links to gene annotations in the Genome Browser, the Known Genes details page and the Gene Sorter; domain information from Superfamily, InterPro and Pfam; three-dimensional structures at the Protein Data Bank and ModBase; and pathway data at KEGG, BioCarta/CGAP and BioCyc. As of August 2004, the Proteome Browser is available for human, mouse and rat proteomes. The browser may be accessed from any Known Genes details page of the Genome Browser at http://genome.ucsc.edu . A user's guide is also available on this website. 
 We describe improvements to two databases that give access to information on genomic sequence similarities, functional elements in DNA and experimental results that demonstrate those functions. GALA, the database of Genome ALignments and Annotations, is now a set of interlinked relational databases for five vertebrate species, human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat and chicken. For each species, GALA records pairwise and multiple sequence alignments, scores derived from those alignments that reflect the likelihood of being under purifying selection or being a regulatory element, and extensive annotations such as genes, gene expression patterns and transcription factor binding sites. The user interface supports simple and complex queries, including operations such as subtraction and intersections as well as clustering and finding elements in proximity to features. dbERGE II, the database of Experimental Results on Gene Expression, contains experimental data from a variety of functional assays. Both databases are now run on the DB2 database management system. Improved hardware and tuning has reduced response times and increased querying capacity, while simplified query interfaces will help direct new users through the querying process. Links are available at http://www.bx.psu.edu/ . 
 Maintained at the Universität Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany, the Compilation of tRNA Sequences and Sequences of tRNA Genes is accessible at the URL http://www.tRNA.uni-bayreuth.de with mirror site located at the Institute of Protein Research, Pushchino, Russia ( http://alpha.protres.ru/trnadbase ). The compilation is a searchable, periodically updated database of currently available tRNA sequences. The present version of the database contains a new Genomic tRNA Compilation including the sequences of tRNA genes from genomic sequences published up to July 2003. It consists of about 5800 tRNA gene sequences from 111 organisms covering archaea, bacteria, higher and lower eukarya. The former Compilation of tRNA Genes (up to the end of 1998) and the updated Compilation tRNA Sequences (561 entries) are also supported by the new software. The database can be explored by using multiple search criteria and sequence templates. The database provides a service that allows to obtain statistical information on the occurrences of certain bases at given positions of the tRNA sequences. This allows phylogenic studies and search for identity elements in respect to interactions of tRNAs with various enzymes. 
 In order to understand gene regulation, accurate and comprehensive knowledge of transcriptional regulatory elements is essential. Here, we report our efforts in building a mammalian Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED) with associated data analysis functions. It collects cis - and trans -regulatory elements and is dedicated to easy data access and analysis for both single-gene-based and genome-scale studies. Distinguishing features of TRED include: (i) relatively complete genome-wide promoter annotation for human, mouse and rat; (ii) availability of gene transcriptional regulation information including transcription factor binding sites and experimental evidence; (iii) data accuracy is ensured by hand curation; (iv) efficient user interface for easy and flexible data retrieval; and (v) implementation of on-the-fly sequence analysis tools. TRED can provide good training datasets for further genome-wide cis -regulatory element prediction and annotation, assist detailed functional studies and facilitate the decipher of gene regulatory networks ( http://rulai.cshl.edu/TRED ). 
 The Silkworm Knowledgebase (SilkDB) is a web-based repository for the curation, integration and study of silkworm genetic and genomic data. With the recent accomplishment of a ∼6X draft genome sequence of the domestic silkworm ( Bombyx mori ), SilkDB provides an integrated representation of the large-scale, genome-wide sequence assembly, cDNAs, clusters of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), transposable elements (TEs), mutants, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and functional annotations of genes with assignments to InterPro domains and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. SilkDB also hosts a set of ESTs from Bombyx mandarina , a wild progenitor of B.mori , and a collection of genes from other Lepidoptera. Comparative analysis results between the domestic and wild silkworm, between B.mori and other Lepidoptera, and between B.mori and the two sequenced insects, fruitfly and mosquito, are displayed by using B.mori genome sequence as a reference framework. Designed as a basic platform, SilkDB strives to provide a comprehensive knowledgebase about the silkworm and present the silkworm genome and related information in systematic and graphical ways for the convenience of in-depth comparative studies. SilkDB is publicly accessible at http://silkworm.genomics.org.cn . 
 The Comprehensive Yeast Genome Database (CYGD) compiles a comprehensive data resource for information on the cellular functions of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and related species, chosen as the best understood model organism for eukaryotes. The database serves as a common resource generated by a European consortium, going beyond the provision of sequence information and functional annotations on individual genes and proteins. In addition, it provides information on the physical and functional interactions among proteins as well as other genetic elements. These cellular networks include metabolic and regulatory pathways, signal transduction and transport processes as well as co-regulated gene clusters. As more yeast genomes are published, their annotation becomes greatly facilitated using S.cerevisiae as a reference. CYGD provides a way of exploring related genomes with the aid of the S.cerevisiae genome as a backbone and SIMAP, the Similarity Matrix of Proteins. The comprehensive resource is available under http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/yeast/ . 
 With the improved secreted protein prediction approach and comprehensive data sources, including Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, RefSeq, Ensembl and CBI-Gene, we have constructed secretomes of human, mouse and rat, with a total of 18 152 secreted proteins. All the entries are ranked according to the prediction confidence. They were further annotated via a proteome annotation pipeline that we developed. We also set up a secreted protein classification pipeline and classified our predicted secreted proteins into different functional categories. To make the dataset more convincing and comprehensive, nine reference datasets are also integrated, such as the secreted proteins from the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) system at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and the vertebrate secreted proteins from Swiss-Prot. All these entries were grouped via a TribeMCL based clustering pipeline. We have constructed a web-based secreted protein database, which has been publicly available at http://spd.cbi.pku.edu.cn . Users can browse the database via a GO assignment or chromosomal-location-based interface. Moreover, text query and sequence similarity search are also provided, and the sequence and annotation data can be downloaded freely from the SPD website. 
 The Nucleic Acids Research Molecular Biology Database Collection is a public online resource that lists the databases described in this and previous issues of Nucleic Acids Research together with other databases of value to the biologist and available throughout the world. All databases included in this Collection are freely available to the public. The 2005 update includes 719 databases, 171 more than the 2004 one. The databases are organized in a hierarchical classification that simplifies the process of finding the right database for any given task. The growing number of databases related to immunology, plant and organelle research have been accommodated by separating them into three new categories. The database summaries provide brief descriptions of the databases, contact details, appropriate references and acknowledgements. The online summaries also serve as a venue for the maintainers of each database to introduce database updates and other improvements in the scope and tools. These updates are particularly important for those databases that have not been described in print in the recent past. The database list and summaries are available online at the Nucleic Acids Research web site, http://nar.oupjournals.org/ . 
 To comprehensively identify transcription start sites and the frequencies of individual mRNAs in human cell libraries, a method of 5′ end Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) was developed recently, which makes it possible to collect a large amount of start site information, and subsequently, we have established a related database server called 5′SAGE. This database displays the observed frequencies of individual 5′ end SAGE tags and previously unknown transcription start sites in the promoter regions, introns and intergenic regions of known genes. 5′SAGE will be useful for analyzing promoter regions and start site variation in different tissues, and is freely available at http://5sage.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ . 
 FlyBase ( http://flybase.org ) is the primary repository of genetic and molecular data of the insect family Drosophilidae. For the most extensively studied species, Drosophila melanogaster , a wide range of data are presented in integrated formats. Data types include mutant phenotypes, molecular characterization of mutant alleles and aberrations, cytological maps, wild-type expression patterns, anatomical images, transgenic constructs and insertions, sequence-level gene models and molecular classification of gene product functions. There is a growing body of data for other Drosophila species; this is expected to increase dramatically over the next year, with the completion of draft-quality genomic sequences of an additional 11 Drosphila species. 
 We describe a comprehensive map of putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) across multiple genomes created using a search method that relies on hidden Markov models built from experimentally determined TFBSs. Using the information in the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases, we built 1134 models for TFBSs and used them to scan regions 10 kb upstream of the start of the transcript for all known genes in the human, mouse and Drosophila melanogaster genomes. The results, together with homology information on clusters of ortholog genes across the three genomes, were used to create a multi-organism catalog of annotated TFBSs. The catalog can be queried through a web interface accessible at http://bio.chip.org/mapper that allows the identification, visualization and selection of TFBSs occurring in the promoter of a gene of interest and also the common factors predicted to bind across the cluster of orthologs that includes that gene. Alternatively, the interface allows the user to retrieve binding sites for a single transcription factor of interest in a single gene or in all genes of the human, mouse or fruit fly genomes. 
 The identification and study of evolutionarily conserved genomic sequences that surround disease-related genes is a valuable tool to gain insight into the functional role of these genes and to better elucidate the pathogenetic mechanisms of disease. We created the DG-CST (Disease Gene Conserved Sequence Tags) database for the identification and detailed annotation of human–mouse conserved genomic sequences that are localized within or in the vicinity of human disease-related genes. CSTs are defined as sequences that show at least 70% identity between human and mouse over a length of at least 100 bp. The database contains CST data relative to over 1088 genes responsible for monogenetic human genetic diseases or involved in the susceptibility to multifactorial/polygenic diseases. DG-CST is accessible via the internet at http://dgcst.ceinge.unina.it/ and may be searched using both simple and complex queries. A graphic browser allows direct visualization of the CSTs and related annotations within the context of the relative gene and its transcripts. 
 ProtoNet is an automatic hierarchical classification of the protein sequence space. In 2004, the ProtoNet (version 4.0) presents the analysis of over one million proteins merged from SwissProt and TrEMBL databases. In addition to rich visualization and analysis tools to navigate the clustering hierarchy, we incorporated several improvements that allow a simplified view of the scaffold of the proteins. An unsupervised, biologically valid method that was developed resulted in a condensation of the ProtoNet hierarchy to only 12% of the clusters. A large portion of these clusters was automatically assigned high confidence biological names according to their correspondence with functional annotations. ProtoNet is available at: http://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il . 
 The Rat Genome Database (RGD) ( http://rgd.mcw.edu ) aims to meet the needs of its community by providing genetic and genomic infrastructure while also annotating the strengths of rat research: biochemistry, nutrition, pharmacology and physiology. Here, we report on RGD's development towards creating a phenome database. Recent developments can be categorized into three groups. (i) Improved data collection and integration to match increased volume and biological scope of research. (ii) Knowledge representation augmented by the implementation of a new ontology and annotation system. (iii) The addition of quantitative trait loci data, from rat, mouse and human to our advanced comparative genomics tools, as well as the creation of new, and enhancement of existing, tools to enable users to efficiently browse and survey research data. The emphasis is on helping researchers find genes responsible for disease through the use of rat models. These improvements, combined with the genomic sequence of the rat, have led to a successful year at RGD with over two million page accesses that represent an over 4-fold increase in a year. Future plans call for increased annotation of biological information on the rat elucidated through its use as a model for human pathobiology. The continued development of toolsets will facilitate integration of these data into the context of rat genomic sequence, as well as allow comparisons of biological and genomic data with the human genomic sequence and of an increasing number of organisms. 
 Genomic projects heavily depend on genome annotations and are limited by the current deficiencies in the published predictions of gene structure and function. It follows that, improved annotation will allow better data mining of genomes, and more secure planning and design of experiments. The purpose of the GeneFarm project is to obtain homogeneous, reliable, documented and traceable annotations for Arabidopsis nuclear genes and gene products, and to enter them into an added-value database. This re-annotation project is being performed exhaustively on every member of each gene family. Performing a family-wide annotation makes the task easier and more efficient than a gene-by-gene approach since many features obtained for one gene can be extrapolated to some or all the other genes of a family. A complete annotation procedure based on the most efficient prediction tools available is being used by 16 partner laboratories, each contributing annotated families from its field of expertise. A database, named GeneFarm, and an associated user-friendly interface to query the annotations have been developed. More than 3000 genes distributed over 300 families have been annotated and are available at http://genoplante-info.infobiogen.fr/Genefarm/ . Furthermore, collaboration with the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics is underway to integrate the GeneFarm data into the protein knowledgebase Swiss-Prot. 
 Information about bacterial subcellular localization (SCL) is important for protein function prediction and identification of suitable drug/vaccine/diagnostic targets. PSORTdb ( http://db.psort.org/ ) is a web-accessible database of SCL for bacteria that contains both information determined through laboratory experimentation and computational predictions. The dataset of experimentally verified information (∼2000 proteins) was manually curated by us and represents the largest dataset of its kind. Earlier versions have been used for training SCL predictors, and its incorporation now into this new PSORTdb resource, with its associated additional annotation information and dataset version control, should aid researchers in future development of improved SCL predictors. The second component of this database contains computational analyses of proteins deduced from the most recent NCBI dataset of completely sequenced genomes. Analyses are currently calculated using PSORTb, the most precise automated SCL predictor for bacterial proteins. Both datasets can be accessed through the web using a very flexible text search engine, a data browser, or using BLAST, and the entire database or search results may be downloaded in various formats. Features such as GO ontologies and multiple accession numbers are incorporated to facilitate integration with other bioinformatics resources. PSORTdb is freely available under GNU General Public License. 
 The Vertebrate Genome Annotation (Vega) database ( http://vega.sanger.ac.uk ) has been designed to be a community resource for browsing manual annotation of finished sequences from a variety of vertebrate genomes. Its core database is based on an Ensembl-style schema, extended to incorporate curation-specific metadata. In collaboration with the genome sequencing centres, Vega attempts to present consistent high-quality annotation of the published human chromosome sequences. In addition, it is also possible to view various finished regions from other vertebrates, including mouse and zebrafish. Vega displays only manually annotated gene structures built using transcriptional evidence, which can be examined in the browser. Attempts have been made to standardize the annotation procedure across each vertebrate genome, which should aid comparative analysis of orthologues across the different finished regions. 
 The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) provides the scientific community with a single, centralized, authoritative resource for protein sequences and functional information. Formed by uniting the Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and PIR protein database activities, the UniProt consortium produces three layers of protein sequence databases: the UniProt Archive (UniParc), the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProt) and the UniProt Reference (UniRef) databases. The UniProt Knowledgebase is a comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase with extensive cross-references. This centrepiece consists of two sections: UniProt/Swiss-Prot, with fully, manually curated entries; and UniProt/TrEMBL, enriched with automated classification and annotation. During 2004, tens of thousands of Knowledgebase records got manually annotated or updated; we introduced a new comment line topic: TOXIC DOSE to store information on the acute toxicity of a toxin; the UniProt keyword list got augmented by additional keywords; we improved the documentation of the keywords and are continuously overhauling and standardizing the annotation of post-translational modifications. Furthermore, we introduced a new documentation file of the strains and their synonyms. Many new database cross-references were introduced and we started to make use of Digital Object Identifiers. We also achieved in collaboration with the Macromolecular Structure Database group at EBI an improved integration with structural databases by residue level mapping of sequences from the Protein Data Bank entries onto corresponding UniProt entries. For convenient sequence searches we provide the UniRef non-redundant sequence databases. The comprehensive UniParc database stores the complete body of publicly available protein sequence data. The UniProt databases can be accessed online ( http://www.uniprot.org ) or downloaded in several formats ( ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub ). New releases are published every two weeks. 
 In recent years, there have been increasing numbers of transcripts identified that do not encode proteins, many of which are developmentally regulated and appear to have regulatory functions. Here, we describe the construction of a comprehensive mammalian noncoding RNA database (RNAdb) which contains over 800 unique experimentally studied non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including many associated with diseases and/or developmental processes. The database is available at http://research.imb.uq.edu.au/RNAdb and is searchable by many criteria. It includes microRNAs and snoRNAs, but not infrastructural RNAs, such as rRNAs and tRNAs, which are catalogued elsewhere. The database also includes over 1100 putative antisense ncRNAs and almost 20 000 putative ncRNAs identified in high-quality murine and human cDNA libraries, with more to be added in the near future. Many of these RNAs are large, and many are spliced, some alternatively. The database will be useful as a foundation for the emerging field of RNomics and the characterization of the roles of ncRNAs in mammalian gene expression and regulation. 
 BarleyBase (BB) ( www.barleybase.org ) is an online database for plant microarrays with integrated tools for data visualization and statistical analysis. BB houses raw and normalized expression data from the two publicly available Affymetrix genome arrays, Barley1 and Arabidopsis ATH1 with plans to include the new Affymetrix 61K wheat, maize, soybean and rice arrays, as they become available. BB contains a broad set of query and display options at all data levels, ranging from experiments to individual hybridizations to probe sets down to individual probes. Users can perform cross-experiment queries on probe sets based on observed expression profiles and/or based on known biological information. Probe set queries are integrated with visualization and analysis tools such as the R statistical toolbox, data filters and a large variety of plot types. Controlled vocabularies for gene and plant ontologies, as well as interconnecting links to physical or genetic map and other genomic data in PlantGDB, Gramene and GrainGenes, allow users to perform EST alignments and gene function prediction using Barley1 exemplar sequences, thus, enhancing cross-species comparison. 
 WormBase ( http://www.wormbase.org ), the model organism database for information about Caenorhabditis elegans and related nematodes, continues to expand in breadth and depth. Over the past year, WormBase has added multiple large-scale datasets including SAGE, interactome, 3D protein structure datasets and NCBI KOGs. To accommodate this growth, the International WormBase Consortium has improved the user interface by adding new features to aid in navigation, visualization of large-scale datasets, advanced searching and data mining. Internally, we have restructured the database models to rationalize the representation of genes and to prepare the system to accept the genome sequences of three additional Caenorhabditis species over the coming year. 
 Entrez Gene ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene ) is NCBI's database for gene-specific information. It does not include all known or predicted genes; instead Entrez Gene focuses on the genomes that have been completely sequenced, that have an active research community to contribute gene-specific information, or that are scheduled for intense sequence analysis. The content of Entrez Gene represents the result of curation and automated integration of data from NCBI's Reference Sequence project (RefSeq), from collaborating model organism databases, and from many other databases available from NCBI. Records are assigned unique, stable and tracked integers as identifiers. The content (nomenclature, map location, gene products and their attributes, markers, phenotypes, and links to citations, sequences, variation details, maps, expression, homologs, protein domains and external databases) is updated as new information becomes available. Entrez Gene is a step forward from NCBI's LocusLink, with both a major increase in taxonomic scope and improved access through the many tools associated with NCBI Entrez. 
 The crop expressed sequence tag database, CR-EST ( http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/cr-est/ ), is a publicly available online resource providing access to sequence, classification, clustering and annotation data of crop EST projects. CR-EST currently holds more than 200 000 sequences derived from 41 cDNA libraries of four species: barley, wheat, pea and potato. The barley section comprises approximately one-third of all publicly available ESTs. CR-EST deploys an automatic EST preparation pipeline that includes the identification of chimeric clones in order to transparently display the data quality. Sequences are clustered in species-specific projects to currently generate a non-redundant set of ∼22 600 consensus sequences and ∼17 200 singletons, which form the basis of the provided set of unigenes. A web application allows the user to compute BLAST alignments of query sequences against the CR-EST database, query data from Gene Ontology and metabolic pathway annotations and query sequence similarities from stored BLAST results. CR-EST also features interactive JAVA-based tools, allowing the visualization of open reading frames and the explorative analysis of Gene Ontology mappings applied to ESTs. 
 ECgene provides annotation for gene structure, function and expression, taking alternative splicing events into consideration. The gene-modeling algorithm combines the genome-based expressed sequence tag (EST) clustering and graph-theoretic transcript assembly procedures. The website provides several viewers and applications that have many unique features useful for the analysis of the transcript structure and gene expression. The summary viewer shows the gene summary and the essence of other annotation programs. The genome browser and the transcript viewer are available for comparing the gene structure of splice variants. Changes in the functional domains by alternative splicing can be seen at a glance in the transcript viewer. We also provide two unique ways of analyzing gene expression. The SAGE tags deduced from the assembled transcripts are used to delineate quantitative expression patterns from SAGE libraries available publically. Furthermore, the cDNA libraries of EST sequences in each cluster are used to infer qualitative expression patterns. It should be noted that the ECgene website provides annotation for the whole transcriptome, not just the alternatively spliced genes. Currently, ECgene supports the human, mouse and rat genomes. The ECgene suite of tools and programs is available at http://genome.ewha.ac.kr/ECgene/ . 
 The SYSTERS project aims to provide a meaningful partitioning of the whole protein sequence space by a fully automatic procedure. A refined two-step algorithm assigns each protein to a family and a superfamily. The sequence data underlying SYSTERS release 4 now comprise several protein sequence databases derived from completely sequenced genomes (ENSEMBL, TAIR, SGD and GeneDB), in addition to the comprehensive Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL databases. The SYSTERS web server ( http://systers.molgen.mpg.de ) provides access to 158 153 SYSTERS protein families. To augment the automatically derived results, information from external databases like Pfam and Gene Ontology are added to the web server. Furthermore, users can retrieve pre-processed analyses of families like multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees. New query options comprise a batch retrieval tool for functional inference about families based on automatic keyword extraction from sequence annotations. A new access point, PhyloMatrix, allows the retrieval of phylogenetic profiles of SYSTERS families across organisms with completely sequenced genomes. 
 The database VBASE2 provides germ-line sequences of human and mouse immunoglobulin variable (V) genes. It acts as an interconnecting platform between several existing self-contained data systems: VBASE2 integrates genome sequence data and links to the V genes in the Ensembl Genome Browser. For a single V gene sequence, all references to the EMBL nucleotide sequence database are provided, including references for V(D)J rearrangements. Furthermore, cross-references to the VBASE database, the IMGT database and the Kabat database are available. A DAS server allows the display of VBASE2 V genes within the Ensembl Genome Browser. VBASE2 can be accessed either by a web-based text query or by a sequence similarity search with the DNAPLOT software. VBASE2 is available at http://www.vbase2.org , and the DAS server is located at http://www.dnaplot.com/das . 
 GeneCards ® is an automatically mined database of human genes that strives to create, along with its auxiliary databases—GeneLoc, GeneNote and GeneAnnot—the most inclusive resource of gene-centered information of the human genome. GeneTide, the Gene Terra Incognita Discovery Endeavor ( http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/genetide/ ), the newest addition to this family, is a transcriptome-focused database which aims to enhance GeneCards with additional expressed sequence tag (EST)-based genes. This is achieved by comprehensively mapping >85% of the ∼5.6 million human ESTs currently available at dbEST to known genes by means of data mining and integration of genomic resources including UniGene, DoTS, AceView and in-house resources. GeneTide thus creates comprehensive links between ESTs and GeneCards genes. Furthermore, groups of unassociated transcripts serve as a basis for defining novel EST-based GeneCards Candidates (EGCs). These EGCs, nearly 25 000 of which were defined in version 0.3 of GeneTide, are further annotated with various parameters, including splicing evidence and expression data extracted from the GeneNote database, to determine their validity as possible de novo genes. 
 Members of a protein family normally have a general biochemical function in common, but frequently one or more subgroups have evolved a slightly different function, such as different substrate specificity. It is important to detect such function shifts for a more accurate functional annotation. The FunShift database described here is a compilation of function shift analysis performed between subfamilies in protein families. It consists of two main components: (i) subfamilies derived from protein domain families and (ii) pairwise subfamily comparisons analyzed for function shift. The present release, FunShift 12, was derived from Pfam 12 and consists of 151 934 subfamilies derived from 7300 families. We carried out function shift analysis by two complementary methods on families with up to 500 members. From a total of 179 210 subfamily pairs, 62 384 were predicted to be functionally shifted in 2881 families. Each subfamily pair is provided with a markup of probable functional specificity-determining sites. Tools for searching and exploring the data are provided to make this database a valuable resource for protein function annotation. Knowledge of these functionally important sites will be useful for experimental biologists performing functional mutation studies. FunShift is available at http://FunShift.cgb.ki.se . 
 To efficiently utilize the growing body of available protein localization data, we have developed Organelle DB, a web-accessible database cataloging more than 25 000 proteins from nearly 60 organelles, subcellular structures and protein complexes in 154 organisms spanning the eukaryotic kingdom. Organelle DB is the first on-line resource devoted to the identification and presentation of eukaryotic proteins localized to organelles and subcellular structures. As such, Organelle DB is a strong resource of data from the human proteome as well as from the major model organisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Arabidopsis thaliana , Drosophila melanogaster , Caenorhabditis elegans and Mus musculus . In particular, Organelle DB is a central repository of yeast data, incorporating results—and actual fluorescent images—from ongoing large-scale studies of protein localization in S.cerevisiae . Each protein in Organelle DB is presented with its sequence and, as available, a detailed description of its function; functions were extracted from relevant model organism databases, and links to these databases are provided within Organelle DB. To facilitate data interoperability, we have annotated all protein localizations using vocabulary from the Gene Ontology consortium. We also welcome new data for inclusion in Organelle DB, which may be freely accessed at http://organelledb.lsi.umich.edu . 
 Genomic and post-genomic biological research has provided fine-grain insights into the molecular processes of life, but also threatens to drown biomedical researchers in data. Moreover, as new high-throughput technologies are developed, the types of data that are gathered en masse are diversifying. The need to collect, store and curate all this information in ways that allow its efficient retrieval and exploitation is greater than ever. The European Bioinformatics Institute's (EBI's) databases and tools have evolved to meet the changing needs of molecular biologists: since we last wrote about our services in the 2003 issue of Nucleic Acids Research , we have launched new databases covering protein–protein interactions (IntAct), pathways (Reactome) and small molecules (ChEBI). Our existing core databases have continued to evolve to meet the changing needs of biomedical researchers, and we have developed new data-access tools that help biologists to move intuitively through the different data types, thereby helping them to put the parts together to understand biology at the systems level. The EBI's data resources are all available on our website at http://www.ebi.ac.uk . 
 The Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) ( http://bind.ca ) archives biomolecular interaction, reaction, complex and pathway information. Our aim is to curate the details about molecular interactions that arise from published experimental research and to provide this information, as well as tools to enable data analysis, freely to researchers worldwide. BIND data are curated into a comprehensive machine-readable archive of computable information and provides users with methods to discover interactions and molecular mechanisms. BIND has worked to develop new methods for visualization that amplify the underlying annotation of genes and proteins to facilitate the study of molecular interaction networks. BIND has maintained an open database policy since its inception in 1999. Data growth has proceeded at a tremendous rate, approaching over 100 000 records. New services provided include a new BIND Query and Submission interface, a Standard Object Access Protocol service and the Small Molecule Interaction Database ( http://smid.blueprint.org ) that allows users to determine probable small molecule binding sites of new sequences and examine conserved binding residues. 
 As database management systems expand their array of analytical functionality, they become powerful research engines for biomedical data analysis and drug discovery. Databases can hold most of the data types commonly required in life sciences and consequently can be used as flexible platforms for the implementation of knowledgebases. Performing data analysis in the database simplifies data management by minimizing the movement of data from disks to memory, allowing pre-filtering and post-processing of datasets, and enabling data to remain in a secure, highly available environment. This article describes the Oracle Database 10 g implementation of BLAST and Regular Expression Searches and provides case studies of their usage in bioinformatics. http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/index.html
 The Stanford Microarray Database (SMD) ( http://smd.stanford.edu ) is a research tool for hundreds of Stanford researchers and their collaborators. In addition, SMD functions as a resource for the entire biological research community by providing unrestricted access to microarray data published by SMD users and by disseminating its source code. In addition to storing GenePix (Axon Instruments) and ScanAlyze output from spotted microarrays, SMD has recently added the ability to store, retrieve, display and analyze the complete raw data produced by several additional microarray platforms and image analysis software packages, so that we can also now accept data from Affymetrix GeneChips (MAS5/GCOS or dChip), Agilent Catalog or Custom arrays (using Agilent's Feature Extraction software) or data created by SpotReader (Niles Scientific). We have implemented software that allows us to accept MAGE-ML documents from array manufacturers and to submit MIAME-compliant data in MAGE-ML format directly to ArrayExpress and GEO, greatly increasing the ease with which data from SMD can be published adhering to accepted standards and also increasing the accessibility of published microarray data to the general public. We have introduced a new tool to facilitate data sharing among our users, so that datasets can be shared during, before or after the completion of data analysis. The latest version of the source code for the complete database package was released in November 2004 ( http://smd.stanford.edu/download/ ), allowing researchers around the world to deploy their own installations of SMD. 
 IMGT/GENE-DB is the comprehensive IMGT genome database for immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) genes from human and mouse, and, in development, from other vertebrates. IMGT/GENE-DB is the international reference for the IG and TR gene nomenclature and works in close collaboration with the HUGO Nomenclature Committee, Mouse Genome Database and genome committees for other species. IMGT/GENE-DB allows a search of IG and TR genes by locus, group and subgroup, which are CLASSIFICATION concepts of IMGT-ONTOLOGY. Short cuts allow the retrieval gene information by gene name or clone name. Direct links with configurable URL give access to information usable by humans or programs. An IMGT/GENE-DB entry displays accurate gene data related to genome (gene localization), allelic polymorphisms (number of alleles, IMGT reference sequences, functionality, etc.) gene expression (known cDNAs), proteins and structures (Protein displays, IMGT Colliers de Perles). It provides internal links to the IMGT sequence databases and to the IMGT Repertoire Web resources, and external links to genome and generalist sequence databases. IMGT/GENE-DB manages the IMGT reference directory used by the IMGT tools for IG and TR gene and allele comparison and assignment, and by the IMGT databases for gene data annotation. IMGT/GENE-DB is freely available at http://imgt.cines.fr . 
 Using the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Genome Project as a test case, we have developed a database and submission system to facilitate a community-based approach to continually updated genome annotation ( http://www.pseudomonas.com ). Researchers submit proposed annotation updates through one of three web-based form options which are then subjected to review, and if accepted, entered into both the database and log file of updates with author acknowledgement. In addition, a coordinator continually reviews literature for suitable updates, as we have found such reviews to be the most efficient. Both the annotations database and updates-log database have Boolean search capability with the ability to sort results and download all data or search results as tab-delimited files. To complement this peer-reviewed genome annotation, we also provide a linked GBrowse view which displays alternate annotations. Additional tools and analyses are also integrated, including PseudoCyc, and knockout mutant information. We propose that this database system, with its focus on facilitating flexible queries of the data and providing access to both peer-reviewed annotations as well as alternate annotation information, may be a suitable model for other genome projects wishing to use a continually updated, community-based annotation approach. The source code is freely available under GNU General Public Licence. 
 Taiwan Polymorphic Marker Database (TPMD) ( http://tpmd.nhri.org.tw/ ) is a marker database designed to provide experimental details and useful marker information allelotyped in Taiwanese populations accompanied by resources and technical supports. The current version deposited more than 372 000 allelotyping data from 1425 frequently used and fluorescent-labeled microsatellite markers with variation types of dinucleotide, trinucleotide and tetranucleotide. TPMD contains text and map displays with searchable and retrievable options for marker names, chromosomal location in various human genome maps and marker heterozygosity in populations of Taiwanese, Japanese and Caucasian. The integration of marker information in map display is useful for the selection of high heterozygosity and commonly used microsatellite markers to refine mapping of diseases locus followed by identification of disease gene by positional candidate cloning. In addition, our results indicated that the number of markers with heterozygosity over 0.7 in Asian populations is lower than that in Caucasian. To increase accuracy and facilitate genetic studies using microsatellite markers, we also list markers with genotyping difficulty due to ambiguity of allele calling and recommend an optimal set of microsatellite markers for genotyping in Taiwanese, and possible extension of genotyping in other Mongoloid populations. 
 Processed pseudogenes result from reverse transcribed mRNAs. In general, because processed pseudogenes lack promoters, they are no longer functional from the moment they are inserted into the genome. Subsequently, they freely accumulate substitutions, insertions and deletions. Moreover, the ancestral structure of processed pseudogenes could be easily inferred using the sequence of their functional homologous genes. Owing to these characteristics, processed pseudogenes represent good neutral markers for studying genome evolution. Recently, there is an increasing interest for these markers, particularly to help gene prediction in the field of genome annotation, functional genomics and genome evolution analysis (patterns of substitution). For these reasons, we have developed a method to annotate processed pseudogenes in complete genomes. To make them useful to different fields of research, we stored them in a nucleic acid database after having annotated them. In this work, we screened both mouse and human complete genomes from ENSEMBL to find processed pseudogenes generated from functional genes with introns. We used a conservative method to detect processed pseudogenes in order to minimize the rate of false positive sequences. Within processed pseudogenes, some are still having a conserved open reading frame and some have overlapping gene locations. We designated as retroelements all reverse transcribed sequences and more strictly, we designated as processed pseudogenes, all retroelements not falling in the two former categories (having a conserved open reading or overlapping gene locations). We annotated 5823 retroelements (5206 processed pseudogenes) in the human genome and 3934 (3428 processed pseudogenes) in the mouse genome. Compared to previous estimations, the total number of processed pseudogenes was underestimated but the aim of this procedure was to generate a high-quality dataset. To facilitate the use of processed pseudogenes in studying genome structure and evolution, DNA sequences from processed pseudogenes, and their functional reverse transcribed homologs, are now stored in a nucleic acid database, HOPPSIGEN. HOPPSIGEN can be browsed on the PBIL (Pôle Bioinformatique Lyonnais) World Wide Web server ( http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/ ) or fully downloaded for local installation. 
 Working in parallel with the efforts to sequence the chicken ( Gallus gallus ) genome, the Beijing Genomics Institute led an international team of scientists from China, USA, UK, Sweden, The Netherlands and Germany to map extensive DNA sequence variation throughout the chicken genome by sampling DNA from domestic breeds. Using the Red Jungle Fowl genome sequence as a reference, we identified 3.1 million non-redundant DNA sequence variants. To facilitate the application of our data to avian genetics and to provide a foundation for functional and evolutionary studies, we created the ‘Chicken Variation Database’ (ChickVD). A graphical MapView shows variants mapped onto the chicken genome in the context of gene annotations and other features, including genetic markers, trait loci, cDNAs, chicken orthologs of human disease genes and raw sequence traces. ChickVD also stores information on quantitative trait loci using data from collaborating institutions and public resources. Our data can be queried by search engine and homology-based BLAST searches. ChickVD is publicly accessible at http://chicken.genomics.org.cn . 
 The Ensembl ( http://www.ensembl.org/ ) project provides a comprehensive and integrated source of annotation of large genome sequences. Over the last year the number of genomes available from the Ensembl site has increased by 7 to 16, with the addition of the six vertebrate genomes of chimpanzee, dog, cow, chicken, tetraodon and frog and the insect genome of honeybee. The majority have been annotated automatically using the Ensembl gene build system, showing its flexibility to reliably annotate a wide variety of genomes. With the increased number of vertebrate genomes, the comparative analysis provided to users has been greatly improved, with new website interfaces allowing annotation of different genomes to be directly compared. The Ensembl software system is being increasingly widely reused in different projects showing the benefits of a completely open approach to software development and distribution. 
 The 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs play crucial roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression through the modulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic mRNA transport, translation efficiency, subcellular localization and message stability. UTRdb is a curated database of 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs, derived from several sources of primary data. Experimentally validated functional motifs are annotated (and also collated as the UTRsite database) and cross-links to genomic and protein data are provided. The integration of UTRdb with genomic and protein data has allowed the implementation of a powerful retrieval resource for the selection and extraction of UTR subsets based on their genomic coordinates and/or features of the protein encoded by the relevant mRNA (e.g. GO term, PFAM domain, etc.). All internet resources implemented for retrieval and functional analysis of 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs are accessible at http://www.ba.itb.cnr.it/UTR/ . 
 The SilkSatDb ( silk moth micro sat ellite d ata b ase) ( http://www.cdfd.org.in/silksatdb ) is a relational database of microsatellites extracted from the available expressed sequence tags and whole genome shotgun sequences of the silkmoth, Bombyx mori . The database has been rendered with a simple and robust web-based search facility, developed using PHP. The SilkSatDb also stores information on primers developed and validated in the laboratory. Users can retrieve information on the microsatellite and the protocols used, along with informative figures and polymorphism status of those microsatellites. In addition, the interface is coupled with Autoprimer, a primer-designing program, using which users can design primers for the loci of interest. 
 Within-species sequence variation data are of special interest since they contain information about recent population/species history, and the molecular evolutionary forces currently in action in natural populations. These data, however, are presently dispersed within generalist databases, and are difficult to access. To solve this problem, we have developed Polymorphix, a database dedicated to sequence polymorphism. It contains within-species homologous sequence families built using EMBL/GenBank under suitable similarity and bibliographic criteria. Polymorphix is an ACNUC structured database allowing both simple and complex queries for population genomic studies. Alignments within families as well as phylogenetic trees can be download. When available, outgroups are included in the alignment. Polymorphix contains sequences from the nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplastic genomes of every eukaryote species represented in EMBL. It can be accessed by a web interface ( http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/polymorphix/query.php ). 
 The rat genome database RatMap ( http://ratmap.org or http://ratmap.gen.gu.se ) has been one of the main resources for rat genome information since 1994. The database is maintained by CMB–Genetics at Göteborg University in Sweden and provides information on rat genes, polymorphic rat DNA-markers and rat quantitative trait loci (QTLs), all curated at RatMap. The database is under the supervision of the Rat Gene and Nomenclature Committee (RGNC); thus much attention is paid to rat gene nomenclature. RatMap presents information on rat idiograms, karyotypes and provides a unified presentation of the rat genome sequence and integrated rat linkage maps. A set of tools is also available to facilitate the identification and characterization of rat QTLs, as well as the estimation of exon/intron number and sizes in individual rat genes. Furthermore, comparative gene maps of rat in regard to mouse and human are provided. 
 Classifying proteins into families and superfamilies allows identification of functionally important conserved domains. The motifs and scoring matrices derived from such conserved regions provide computational tools that recognize similar patterns in novel sequences, and thus enable the prediction of protein function for genomes. The eBLOCKs database enumerates a cascade of protein blocks with varied conservation levels for each functional domain. A biologically important region is most stringently conserved among a smaller family of highly similar proteins. The same region is often found in a larger group of more remotely related proteins with a reduced stringency. Through enumeration, highly specific signatures can be generated from blocks with more columns and fewer family members, while highly sensitive signatures can be derived from blocks with fewer columns and more members as in a superfamily. By applying PSI-BLAST and a modified K -means clustering algorithm, eBLOCKs automatically groups protein sequences according to different levels of similarity. Multiple sequence alignments are made and trimmed into a series of ungapped blocks. Motifs and position-specific scoring matrices were derived from eBLOCKs and made available for sequence search and annotation. The eBLOCKs database provides a tool for high-throughput genome annotation with maximal specificity and sensitivity. The eBLOCKs database is freely available on the World Wide Web at http://motif.stanford.edu/eblocks/ to all users for online usage. Academic and not-for-profit institutions wishing copies of the program may contact Douglas L. Brutlag ( brutlag@stanford.edu ). Commercial firms wishing copies of the program for internal installation may contact Jacqueline Tay at the Stanford Office of Technology Licensing ( jacqueline.tay@stanford.edu ; http://otl.stanford.edu/ ). 
 The database of 3D Interacting Domains (3did) is a collection of domain–domain interactions in proteins for which high-resolution three-dimensional structures are known. 3did exploits structural information to provide critical molecular details necessary for understanding how interactions occur. It also offers an overview of how similar in structure are interactions between different members of the same protein family. The database also contains Gene Ontology-based functional annotations and interactions between yeast proteins from large-scale interaction discovery studies. A web-based tool to query 3did is available at http://3did.embl.de . 
 Owing to the high costs involved, only 28 eukaryotic genomes have been fully sequenced to date. On the other hand, an increasing number of projects have been initiated to generate survey sequence data for a large number of other eukaryotic organisms. For the most part, these data are poorly organized and difficult to analyse. Here, we present PartiGeneDB ( http://www.partigenedb.org ), a publicly available database resource, which collates and processes these sequence datasets on a species-specific basis to form non-redundant sets of gene objects—which we term partial genomes. Users may query the database to identify particular genes of interest either on the basis of sequence similarity or via the use of simple text searches for specific patterns of BLAST annotation. Alternatively, users can examine entire partial genome datasets on the basis of relative expression of gene objects or by the use of an interactive Java-based tool (SimiTri), which displays sequence similarity relationships for a large number of sequence objects in a single graphic. PartiGeneDB facilitates regular incremental updates of new sequence datasets associated with both new and exisitng species. PartiGeneDB currently contains the assembled partial genomes derived from 1.83 million sequences associated with 247 different eukaryotes. 
 T1DBase ( http://T1DBase.org ) is a public website and database that supports the type 1 diabetes (T1D) research community. The site is currently focused on the molecular genetics and biology of T1D susceptibility and pathogenesis. It includes the following datasets: annotated genome sequence for human, rat and mouse; information on genetically identified T1D susceptibility regions in human, rat and mouse, and genetic linkage and association studies pertaining to T1D; descriptions of NOD mouse congenic strains; the Beta Cell Gene Expression Bank, which reports expression levels of genes in beta cells under various conditions, and annotations of gene function in beta cells; data on gene expression in a variety of tissues and organs; and biological pathways from KEGG and BioCarta. Tools on the site include the GBrowse genome browser, site-wide context dependent search, Connect-the-Dots for connecting gene and other identifiers from multiple data sources, Cytoscape for visualizing and analyzing biological networks, and the GESTALT workbench for genome annotation. All data are open access and all software is open source. 
 We have developed an information repository named SpliceInfo to collect the occurrences of the four major alternative-splicing (AS) modes in human genome; these include exon skipping, 5′-alternative splicing, 3′-alternative splicing and intron retention. The dataset is derived by comparing the nucleotide and protein sequences available for a given gene for evidence of AS. Additional features such as the tissue specificity of the mRNA, the protein domain contained by exons, the GC-ratio of exons, the repeats contained within the exons, and the Gene Ontology are annotated computationally for each exonic region that is alternatively spliced. Motivated by a previous investigation of AS-related motifs such as exonic splicing enhancer and exonic splicing silencer, this resource also provides a means of identifying motifs candidates and this should help to identify potential regulatory mechanisms within a particular exonic sequence set and its two flanking intronic sequence sets. This is carried out using motif discovery tools to identify motif candidates related to alternative splicing regulation and together with a secondary structure prediction tool, will help in the identification of the structural properties of such regulatory motifs. The integrated resource is now available on http://SpliceInfo.mbc.NCTU.edu.tw/ . 
 A contig-oriented database for annotation of the rice genome has been constructed to facilitate map-based rice genomics. The Rice Annotation Database has the following functional features: (i) extensive effort of manual annotations of P1-derived artificial chromosome/bacterial artificial chromosome clones can be merged at chromosome and contig-level; (ii) concise visualization of the annotation information such as the predicted genes, results of various prediction programs (RiceHMM, Genscan, Genscan+, Fgenesh, GeneMark, etc.), homology to expressed sequence tag, full-length cDNA and protein; (iii) user-friendly clone / gene query system; (iv) download functions for nucleotide, amino acid and coding sequences; (v) analysis of various features of the genome (GC-content, average value, etc.); and (vi) genome-wide homology search (BLAST) of contig- and chromosome-level genome sequence to allow comparative analysis with the genome sequence of other organisms. As of October 2004, the database contains a total of 215 Mb sequence with relevant annotation results including 30 000 manually curated genes. The database can provide the latest information on manual annotation as well as a comprehensive structural analysis of various features of the rice genome. The database can be accessed at http://rad.dna.affrc.go.jp/ . 
 The public expressed sequence tag collections are continually being enriched with high-quality sequences that represent an ever-expanding range of taxonomically diverse plant species. While these sequence collections provide biased insight into the populations of expressed genes available within individual species and their associated tissues, the information is conceivably of wider relevance in a comparative context. When we consider the available expressed sequence tag (EST) collections of summer 2004, most of the major plant taxonomic clades are at least superficially represented. Investigation of the five million available plant ESTs provides a wealth of information that has applications in modelling the routes of plant genome evolution and the identification of lineage-specific genes and gene families. Over four million ESTs from over 50 distinct plant species have been collated within an EST analysis pipeline called openSputnik. The ESTs were resolved down into approximately one million unigene sequences. These have been annotated using orthology-based annotation transfer from reference plant genomes and using a variety of contemporary bioinformatics methods to assign peptide, structural and functional attributes. The openSputnik database is available at http://sputnik.btk.fi . 
 The PDBSite database provides comprehensive structural and functional information on various protein sites (post-translational modification, catalytic active, organic and inorganic ligand binding, protein–protein, protein–DNA and protein–RNA interactions) in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The PDBSite is available online at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/gnw/pdbsite/ . It consists of functional sites extracted from PDB using the SITE records and of an additional set containing the protein interaction sites inferred from the contact residues in heterocomplexes. The PDBSite was set up by automated processing of the PDB. The PDBSite database can be queried through the functional description and the structural characteristics of the site and its environment. The PDBSite is integrated with the PDBSiteScan tool allowing structural comparisons of a protein against the functional sites. The PDBSite enables the recognition of functional sites in protein tertiary structures, providing annotation of function through structure. The PDBSite is updated after each new PDB release. 
 The Human Ageing Genomic Resources (HAGR) is a collection of online resources for studying the biology of human ageing. HAGR features two main databases: GenAge and AnAge. GenAge is a curated database of genes related to human ageing. Entries were primarily selected based on genetic perturbations in animal models and human diseases as well as an extensive literature review. Each entry includes a variety of automated and manually curated information, including, where available, protein–protein interactions, the relevant literature, and a description of the gene and how it relates to human ageing. The goal of GenAge is to provide the most complete and comprehensive database of genes related to human ageing on the Internet as well as render an overview of the genetics of human ageing. AnAge is an integrative database describing the ageing process in several organisms and featuring, if available, maximum life span, taxonomy, developmental schedules and metabolic rate, making AnAge a unique resource for the comparative biology of ageing. Associated with the databases are data-mining tools and software designed to investigate the role of genes and proteins in the human ageing process as well as analyse ageing across different taxa. HAGR is freely available to the academic community at http://genomics.senescence.info . 
 PDBsum is a database of mainly pictorial summaries of the 3D structures of proteins and nucleic acids in the Protein Data Bank. Its pages aim to provide an at-a-glance view of the contents of every 3D structure, plus detailed structural analyses of each protein chain, DNA–RNA chain and any bound ligands and metals. In the past year, the database has been significantly improved, in terms of both appearance and new content. Moreover, it has moved to its new address at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/pdbsum . 
 ArrayExpress is a public repository for microarray data that supports the MIAME (Minimum Informa-tion About a Microarray Experiment) requirements and stores well-annotated raw and normalized data. As of November 2004, ArrayExpress contains data from ∼12 000 hybridizations covering 35 species. Data can be submitted online or directly from local databases or LIMS in a standard format, and password-protected access to prepublication data is provided for reviewers and authors. The data can be retrieved by accession number or queried by vari-ous parameters such as species, author and array platform. A facility to query experiments by gene and sample properties is provided for a growing subset of curated data that is loaded in to the ArrayExpress data warehouse. Data can be visualized and analysed using Expression Profiler, the integrated data analysis tool. ArrayExpress is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress . 
 The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) forms the core of the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) system ( http://www.informatics.jax.org ), a model organism database resource for the laboratory mouse. MGD provides essential integration of experimental knowledge for the mouse system with information annotated from both literature and online sources. MGD curates and presents consensus and experimental data representations of genotype (sequence) through phenotype information, including highly detailed reports about genes and gene products. Primary foci of integration are through representations of relationships among genes, sequences and phenotypes. MGD collaborates with other bioinformatics groups to curate a definitive set of information about the laboratory mouse and to build and implement the data and semantic standards that are essential for comparative genome analysis. Recent improvements in MGD discussed here include the enhancement of phenotype resources, the re-development of the International Mouse Strain Resource, IMSR, the update of mammalian orthology datasets and the electronic publication of classic books in mouse genetics. 
 The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the central worldwide repository for three-dimensional (3D) structure data of biological macromolecules. The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) has completely redesigned its resource for the distribution and query of 3D structure data. The re-engineered site is currently in public beta test at http://pdbbeta.rcsb.org . The new site expands the functionality of the existing site by providing structure data in greater detail and uniformity, improved query and enhanced analysis tools. A new key feature is the integration and searchability of data from over 20 other sources covering genomic, proteomic and disease relationships. The current capabilities of the re-engineered site, which will become the RCSB production site at http://www.pdb.org in late 2005, are described. 
 SBASE ( http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/sbase ) is an online resource designed to facilitate the detection of domain homologies based on sequence database search. The present release of the SBASE A library of protein domain sequences contains 972 397 protein sequence segments annotated by structure, function, ligand-binding or cellular topology, clustered into 8547 domain groups. SBASE B contains 169 916 domain sequences clustered into 2526 less well-characterized groups. Domain prediction is based on an evaluation of database search results in comparison with a ‘similarity network’ of inter-sequence similarity scores, using support vector machines trained on similarity search results of known domains. 
 We have developed a new database that collects all protein folding data into a single, easily accessible public resource. The Protein Folding Database (PFD) contains annotated structural, methodological, kinetic and thermodynamic data for more than 50 proteins, from 39 families. A user-friendly web interface has been developed that allows powerful searching, browsing and information retrieval, whilst providing links to other protein databases. The database structure allows visualization of folding data in a useful and novel way, with a long-term aim of facilitating data mining and bioinformatics approaches. PFD can be accessed freely at http://pfd.med.monash.edu.au . 
 NONCODE is an integrated knowledge database dedicated to non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), that is to say, RNAs that function without being translated into proteins. All ncRNAs in NONCODE were filtered automatically from literature and GenBank, and were later manually curated. The distinctive features of NONCODE are as follows: (i) the ncRNAs in NONCODE include almost all the types of ncRNAs, except transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs. (ii) All ncRNA sequences and their related information (e.g. function, cellular role, cellular location, chromosomal information, etc.) in NONCODE have been confirmed manually by consulting relevant literature: more than 80% of the entries are based on experimental data. (iii) Based on the cellular process and function, which a given ncRNA is involved in, we introduced a novel classification system, labeled process function class , to integrate existing classification systems. (iv) In addition, some 1100 ncRNAs have been grouped into nine other classes according to whether they are specific to gender or tissue or associated with tumors and diseases, etc. (v) NONCODE provides a user-friendly interface, a visualization platform and a convenient search option, allowing efficient recovery of sequence, regulatory elements in the flanking sequences, secondary structure, related publications and other information. The first release of NONCODE (v1.0) contains 5339 non-redundant sequences from 861 organisms, including eukaryotes, eubacteria, archaebacteria, virus and viroids. Access is free for all users through a web interface at http://noncode.bioinfo.org.cn . 
 The Human Anatomic Gene Expression Library (H-ANGEL) is a resource for information concerning the anatomical distribution and expression of human gene transcripts. The tool contains protein expression data from multiple platforms that has been associated with both manually annotated full-length cDNAs from H-InvDB and RefSeq sequences. Of the H-Inv predicted genes, 18 897 have associated expression data generated by at least one platform. H-ANGEL utilizes categorized mRNA expression data from both publicly available and proprietary sources. It incorporates data generated by three types of methods from seven different platforms. The data are provided to the user in the form of a web-based viewer with numerous query options. H-ANGEL is updated with each new release of cDNA and genome sequence build. In future editions, we will incorporate the capability for expression data updates from existing and new platforms. H-ANGEL is accessible at http://www.jbirc.aist.go.jp/hinv/h-angel/ . 
 The Legume Information System (LIS) ( http://www.comparative-legumes.org ), developed by the National Center for Genome Resources in cooperation with the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS), is a comparative legume resource that integrates genetic and molecular data from multiple legume species enabling cross-species genomic and transcript comparisons. The LIS virtual plant interface allows simplified and intuitive navigation of transcript data from Medicago truncatula , Lotus japonicus , Glycine max and Arabidopsis thaliana . Transcript libraries are represented as images of plant organs in different developmental stages, which are selected to query the analyzed and annotated data. Complex queries can be accomplished by adding modifiers, keywords and sequence names. The LIS also contains annotated genomic data featuring transcript alignments to validate gene predictions as well as motif and similarity analyses. The genomic browser supports comparative analysis via novel dynamic functional annotation comparisons. CMap, developed as part of the GMOD project ( http://www.gmod.org/cmap/index.shtml ), has been incorporated to support comparative analyses of community linkage and physical map data. LIS is being expanded to incorporate gene expression and biochemical pathways which will be seamlessly integrated forming a knowledge discovery framework. 
 We have created the Functional Element SNPs Database (FESD) that categorizes functional elements in human genic regions and provides a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within each area. In the FESD, the human genic regions were divided into 10 different functional elements, such as promoter regions, CpG islands, 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs), translation start sites, splice sites, coding exons, introns, translation stop sites, polyadenylation signals and 3′-UTRs, and subsequently, all the known SNPs were assigned to each functional element at their respective position. With the FESD web interface, users can select a set of SNPs in the specific functional elements and get their flanking sequences for genotyping experiments, which will help in finding mutations that contribute to the common and polygenic diseases. A web interface for the FESD is freely available at http://combio.kribb.re.kr/ksnp/resd/ . 
 A large database of homologous sequence alignments with good estimates of evolutionary distances can be a valuable resource for molecular evolutionary studies and phylogenetic research in particular. We recently created a database containing 159 921 transcripts from human, mouse, rat, zebrafish and fugu species. Approximately 16 000 homology groups were identified with the help of Ensembl homology evidence. At the macro-level, the database allows us to answer queries of the form:  What is the average k -distance between 5′ untranslated regions of human and mouse?  List the 10 groups with the highest Ka / Ks ratio between mouse and rat. List all identical proteins between human and rat. Researchers interested in specific proteins can use a simple web interface to retrieve the homology groups of interest, examine all pairwise distances between members of the group and study the conservation of exon–intron gene structures using a graphical interface. The database is available at http://warta.bio.psu.edu/DED/ . 
 The EcoCyc database ( http://EcoCyc.org/ ) is a comprehensive source of information on the biology of the prototypical model organism Escherichia coli K12. The mission for EcoCyc is to contain both computable descriptions of, and detailed comments describing, all genes, proteins, pathways and molecular interactions in E.coli . Through ongoing manual curation, extensive information such as summary comments, regulatory information, literature citations and evidence types has been extracted from 8862 publications and added to Version 8.5 of the EcoCyc database. The EcoCyc database can be accessed through a World Wide Web interface, while the downloadable Pathway Tools software and data files enable computational exploration of the data and provide enhanced querying capabilities that web interfaces cannot support. For example, EcoCyc contains carefully curated information that can be used as training sets for bioinformatics prediction of entities such as promoters, operons, genetic networks, transcription factor binding sites, metabolic pathways, functionally related genes, protein complexes and protein–ligand interactions. 
Brassica ASTRA is a public database for genomic information on Brassica species. The database incorporates expressed sequences with Swiss-Prot and GenBank comparative sequence annotation as well as secondary Gene Ontology (GO) annotation derived from the comparison with Arabidopsis TAIR GO annotations. Simple sequence repeat molecular markers are identified within resident sequences and mapped onto the closely related Arabidopsis genome sequence. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences derived from the Multinational Brassica Genome Project are also mapped onto the Arabidopsis genome sequence enabling users to identify candidate Brassica BACs corresponding to syntenic regions of Arabidopsis . This information is maintained in a MySQL database with a web interface providing the primary means of interrogation. The database is accessible at http://hornbill.cspp.latrobe.edu.au . 
 CandidaDB is a database dedicated to the genome of the most prevalent systemic fungal pathogen of humans, Candida albicans . CandidaDB is based on an annotation of the Stanford Genome Technology Center C.albicans genome sequence data by the European Galar Fungail Consortium. CandidaDB Release 2.0 (June 2004) contains information pertaining to Assembly 19 of the genome of C.albicans strain SC5314. The current release contains 6244 annotated entries corresponding to 130 tRNA genes and 5917 protein-coding genes. For these, it provides tentative functional assignments along with numerous pre-run analyses that can assist the researcher in the evaluation of gene function for the purpose of specific or large-scale analysis. CandidaDB is based on GenoList, a generic relational data schema and a World Wide Web interface that has been adapted to the handling of eukaryotic genomes. The interface allows users to browse easily through genome data and retrieve information. CandidaDB also provides more elaborate tools, such as pattern searching, that are tightly connected to the overall browsing system. As the C.albicans genome is diploid and still incompletely assembled, CandidaDB provides tools to browse the genome by individual supercontigs and to examine information about allelic sequences obtained from complementary contigs. CandidaDB is accessible at http://genolist.pasteur.fr/CandidaDB . 
 Recurrent chromosome aberrations are an important resource when associating human pathologies to specific genes. However, for technical reasons a large number of chromosome breakpoints are defined only at the level of cytobands and many of the genes involved remain unidentified. We developed a web-based information system that mines the scientific literature and generates textual and comprehensive information on all human breakpoints. We show that the statistical analysis of this textual information and its combination with genomic data can identify genes directly involved in DNA rearrangements. The Human Chromosome Aberration Database (HCAD) is publicly accessible at http://www.pdg.cnb.uam.es/UniPub/HCAD/ . 
 The nuclear matrix (NM) is a structure resulting from the aggregation of proteins and RNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells; it is the ‘sticky bit’ that remains after aggressive DNAse digestion and salt extraction protocols. Owing to the important role of the NM in DNA replication, DNA transcription and RNA splicing, the expression pattern of NM proteins has become an important early indicator for numerous cancers/tumors. Recent descriptions of the NM structure distinguish between a network-like ‘internal nuclear matrix’ (INM) and a ‘nuclear shell’ that connects the INM to the inner and outer nuclear membranes. A cautious NM preparation protocol reveals a coat of proteins on top of the INM; these proteins are usually referred to as the ‘nuclear matrix-associated proteins’. Here, we describe a new database (NMPdb at http://www.rostlab.org/db/NMPdb/ ) that currently contains details of 398 NM proteins. We collected these data through a semi-automated analysis of over 3000 scientific articles in PubMed. We could match these 398 proteins to 302 protein sequences in UniProt or GenBank. Our NMPdb repository annotates these links along with the following annotations: organism, cell type, PubMed identifier, sequence-based predictions of structural and functional features and for some entries the explicit sequence segment that is responsible for localization (nuclear matrix targeting signal). 
 The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl ), maintained at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) near Cambridge, UK, is a comprehensive collection of nucleotide sequences and annotation from available public sources. The database is part of an international collaboration with DDBJ (Japan) and GenBank (USA). Data are exchanged daily between the collaborating institutes to achieve swift synchrony. Webin is the preferred tool for individual submissions of nucleotide sequences, including Third Party Annotation (TPA) and alignments. Automated procedures are provided for submissions from large-scale sequencing projects and data from the European Patent Office. New and updated data records are distributed daily and the whole EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database is released four times a year. Access to the sequence data is provided via ftp and several WWW interfaces. With the web-based Sequence Retrieval System (SRS) it is also possible to link nucleotide data to other specialist molecular biology databases maintained at the EBI. Other tools are available for sequence similarity searching (e.g. FASTA and BLAST). Changes over the past year include the removal of the sequence length limit, the launch of the EMBLCDSs dataset, extension of the Sequence Version Archive functionality and the revision of quality rules for TPA data. 
 The GeneNet system is designed for collection and analysis of the data on gene and metabolic networks, signal transduction pathways and kinetic characteristics of elementary processes. In the past 2 years, the GeneNet structure was considerably improved: (i) the current version of the database is now implemented using ORACLE9i; (ii) the capacities to describe the structure of the protein complexes and the interactions between the units are increased; (iii) two tables with kinetic constants and more detailed descriptions of certain reactions were added; and (iv) a module for kinetic modeling was supplemented. The current SRS release of the GeneNet database contains 37 graphical maps of gene networks, as well as descriptions of 1766 proteins, 1006 genes, 241 small molecules and 3254 relationships between gene network units, and 552 kinetic constants. Information distributed between 16 interlinked tables was obtained by annotating 1980 journal publications. SRS release of the GeneNet database, the graphical viewer and the modeling section are available at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/gnw/genenet/ . 
 In the past year, we at DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of Japan; http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp ) collected and released 1 066 084 entries or 718 072 425 bases including the whole chromosome 22 of chimpanzee, the whole-genome shotgun sequences of silkworm and various others. On the other hand, we hosted workshops for human full-length cDNA annotation and participated in jamborees of mouse full-length cDNA annotation. The annotated data are made public at DDBJ. We are also in collaboration with a RIKEN team to accept and release the CAGE (Cap Analysis Gene Expression) data under a new category, MGA (Mass Sequences for Genome Annotation). The data will be useful for studying gene expression control in many aspects. 
RNA splicing is an essential step in gene expression, and is often variable, giving rise to multiple alternatively spliced mRNA and protein isoforms from a single gene locus. The design of effective databases to support experimental and computational investigations of alternative splicing (AS) is a significant challenge. In an effort to integrate accurate exon and splice site annotation with current knowledge about splicing regulatory elements and predicted AS events, and to link information about the splicing of orthologous genes in different species, we have developed the Hollywood system. This database was built upon genomic annotation of splicing patterns of known genes derived from spliced alignment of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) and expressed sequence tags, and links features such as splice site sequence and strength, exonic splicing enhancers and silencers, conserved and non-conserved patterns of splicing, and cDNA library information for inferred alternative exons. Hollywood was implemented as a relational database and currently contains comprehensive information for human and mouse. It is accompanied by a web query tool that allows searches for sets of exons with specific splicing characteristics or splicing regulatory element composition, or gives a graphical or sequence-level summary of splicing patterns for a specific gene. A streamlined graphical representation of gene splicing patterns is provided, and these patterns can alternatively be layered onto existing information in the UCSC Genome Browser. The database is accessible at http://hollywood.mit.edu.
Meiotic recombination occurs preferentially at certain regions in the genome referred to as hot spots. The number of hot spots known in humans has increased manifold in recent years. The identification of these hot spots in humans is of great interest to population and medical geneticists since they influence the structure of Linkage Disequilibrium and Haplotype blocks in human populations, whose patterns have applications in mapping disease genes. HUMHOT is a web-based database of Human Meiotic Recombination Hot Spots. The database comprises DNA sequences corresponding to the hot spot regions from the literature that have been mapped to a high resolution (<4 kb) in humans. It also provides flanking sequence information for the hot spot region along with references describing the hot spot. The database can be queried based on hot spot identity, chromosome position or by homology to user-defined sequences. It is also updated with new hot spot sequences as they are discovered and provides hyperlinks to commonly used tools for estimating recombination rates, performing genetic analysis and new advances in our understanding of meiotic hot spots. Public access to the HUMHOT database is available at http://www.jncasr.ac.in/humhot.
The noncoding RNAs and protein related biomacromolecules interaction database (NPInter; http://bioinfo.ibp.ac.cn/NPInter or http://www.bioinfo.org.cn/NPInter) is a database that documents experimentally determined functional interactions between noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and protein related biomacromolecules (PRMs) (proteins, mRNAs or genomic DNAs). NPInter intends to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive and integrated tool for efficient browsing and extraction of information on interactions between ncRNAs and PRMs. Beyond cataloguing details of these interactions, the NPInter will be useful for understanding ncRNA function, as it adds a very important functional element, ncRNAs, to the biomolecule interaction network and sets up a bridge between the coding and the noncoding kingdoms.
The Génolevures online database (http://cbi.labri.fr/Genolevures/) provides tools and data relative to 4 complete and 10 partial genome sequences determined and manually annotated by the Génolevures Consortium, to facilitate comparative genomic studies of hemiascomycetous yeasts. With their relatively small and compact genomes, yeasts offer a unique opportunity for exploring eukaryotic genome evolution. The new version of the Génolevures database provides truly complete (subtelomere to subtelomere) chromosome sequences, 25 000 protein-coding and tRNA genes, and in silico analyses for each gene element. A new feature of the database is a novel collection of conserved multi-species protein families and their mapping to metabolic pathways, coupled with an advanced search feature. Data are presented with a focus on relations between genes and genomes: conservation of genes and gene families, speciation, chromosomal reorganization and synteny. The Génolevures site includes an area for specific studies by members of its international community.
BodyMap-Xs (http://bodymap.jp) is a database for cross-species gene expression comparison. It was created by the anatomical breakdown of 17 million animal expressed sequence tag (EST) records in DDBJ using a sorting program tailored for this purpose. In BodyMap-Xs, users are allowed to compare the expression patterns of orthologous and paralogous genes in a coherent manner. This will provide valuable insights for the evolutionary study of gene expression and identification of a responsive motif for a particular expression pattern. In addition, starting from a concise overview of the taxonomical and anatomical breakdown of all animal ESTs, users can navigate to obtain gene expression ranking of a particular tissue in a particular animal. This method may lead to the understanding of the similarities and differences between the homologous tissues across animal species. BodyMap-Xs will be automatically updated in synchronization with the major update in DDBJ, which occurs periodically.
The high similarity of tunicates and vertebrates during their development coupled with the transparency of tunicate larvae, their well-studied cell lineages and the availability of simple and efficient transgenesis methods makes of this subphylum an ideal system for the investigation of vertebrate physiological and developmental processes. Recently, the sequencing of two different Ciona genomes has lead to the identification of numerous genes. In order to better understand the regulation of these genes, a database was created containing information on regulation of tunicate genes collected from literature. It includes for instance information regarding the minimal promoter length, the transcription factors involved and their binding sites, as well as the localization of the gene expression. Additionally, binding sites for characterized transcription factors were predicted based on published in vitro recognition sites. Comparison of the promoters of homologous genes in different species is also provided to allow identification of conserved cis elements. At the time of writing, information about 184 promoters, containing 73 identified binding sites and >2000 newly predicted binding sites is available. This database is accessible at http://dbtgr.hgc.jp.
EndoNet is a new database that provides information about the components of endocrine networks and their relations. It focuses on the endocrine cell-to-cell communication and enables the analysis of intercellular regulatory pathways in humans. In the EndoNet data model, two classes of components span a bipartite directed graph. One class represents the hormones (in the broadest sense) secreted by defined donor cells. The other class consists of the acceptor or target cells expressing the corresponding hormone receptors. The identity and anatomical environment of cell types, tissues and organs is defined through references to the CYTOMER® ontology. With the EndoNet user interface, it is possible to query the database for hormones, receptors or tissues and to combine several items from different search rounds in one complex result set, from which a network can be reconstructed and visualized. For each entity, a detailed characteristics page is available. Some well-established endocrine pathways are offered as showcases in the form of predefined result sets. These sets can be used as a starting point for a more complex query or for obtaining a quick overview. The EndoNet database is accessible at http://endonet.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de/.
Among the major enteric bacterial pathogens, Shigella is found to display extreme genome diversity and dynamics, which imposes a challenge in comparative genomic studies. To facilitate further studies in this area, we have constructed an integrated online database, ShiBASE (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/ShiBASE/),which contains Shigella genomic sequences of four species and additional comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data of 43 serotypes. ShiBASE offers online comparative analysis on DNA sequences, gene orders, metabolic pathways and virulence factors. In addition, ShiBASE has a newly developed online comparative visualization service, Shi-align, which enables the alignment of any query sequence with the reference genome sequences.
The imprinted gene and parent-of-origin effect database (www.otago.ac.nz/IGC) consists of two sections. One section catalogues the current literature on imprinted genes in humans and animals. The second, and new, section catalogues current reports of parental origin of de novo mutations in humans alone. The addition of a catalogue of de novo mutations that show a parent-of-origin effect expands the scope of the database and provides a useful tool for examining parental origin trends for different types of spontaneous mutations. This new section includes >1700 mutations, found in 59 different disorders. The 85 imprinted genes are described in 152 entries from several mammalian species. In addition, >300 other entries describe a range of reported parent-of-origin effects in animals.
pSTIING (http://pstiing.licr.org) is a new publicly accessible web-based application and knowledgebase featuring 65 228 distinct molecular associations (comprising protein–protein, protein–lipid, protein–small molecule interactions and transcriptional regulatory associations), ligand–receptor–cell type information and signal transduction modules. It has a particular major focus on regulatory networks relevant to chronic inflammation, cell migration and cancer. The web application and interface provide graphical representations of networks allowing users to combine and extend transcriptional regulatory and signalling modules, infer molecular interactions across species and explore networks via protein domains/motifs, gene ontology annotations and human diseases. pSTIING also supports the direct cross-correlation of experimental results with interaction information in the knowledgebase via the CLADIST tool associated with pSTIING, which currently analyses and clusters gene expression, proteomic and phenotypic datasets. This allows the contextual projection of co-expression patterns onto prior network information, facilitating the identification of functional modules in physiologically relevant systems.
RegulonDB is the internationally recognized reference database of Escherichia coli K-12 offering curated knowledge of the regulatory network and operon organization. It is currently the largest electronically-encoded database of the regulatory network of any free-living organism. We present here the recently launched RegulonDB version 5.0 radically different in content, interface design and capabilities. Continuous curation of original scientific literature provides the evidence behind every single object and feature. This knowledge is complemented with comprehensive computational predictions across the complete genome. Literature-based and predicted data are clearly distinguished in the database. Starting with this version, RegulonDB public releases are synchronized with those of EcoCyc since our curation supports both databases. The complex biology of regulation is simplified in a navigation scheme based on three major streams: genes, operons and regulons. Regulatory knowledge is directly available in every navigation step. Displays combine graphic and textual information and are organized allowing different levels of detail and biological context. This knowledge is the backbone of an integrated system for the graphic display of the network, graphic and tabular microarray comparisons with curated and predicted objects, as well as predictions across bacterial genomes, and predicted networks of functionally related gene products. Access RegulonDB at http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx.
We present the YEAst Search for Transcriptional Regulators And Consensus Tracking (YEASTRACT; www.yeastract.com) database, a tool for the analysis of transcription regulatory associations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This database is a repository of 12 346 regulatory associations between transcription factors and target genes, based on experimental evidence which was spread throughout 861 bibliographic references. It also includes 257 specific DNA-binding sites for more than a hundred characterized transcription factors. Further information about each yeast gene included in the database was obtained from Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), Regulatory Sequences Analysis Tools and Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium. Computational tools are also provided to facilitate the exploitation of the gathered data when solving a number of biological questions as exemplified in the Tutorial also available on the system. YEASTRACT allows the identification of documented or potential transcription regulators of a given gene and of documented or potential regulons for each transcription factor. It also renders possible the comparison between DNA motifs, such as those found to be over-represented in the promoter regions of co-regulated genes, and the transcription factor-binding sites described in the literature. The system also provides an useful mechanism for grouping a list of genes (for instance a set of genes with similar expression profiles as revealed by microarray analysis) based on their regulatory associations with known transcription factors.
The schema of the previously described Escherischiacoli database coliBASE has been applied to a number of other bacterial taxa, under the collective name xBASE. The new databases include CampyDB for Campylobacter, Helicobacter and Wolinella; PseudoDB for pseudomonads; ClostriDB for clostridia; RhizoDB for Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium; and MycoDB, for Mycobacterium, Streptomyces and related organisms. The databases provide user friendly access to annotation and genome comparisons through a web-based graphical interface. Newly developed features include whole genome displays, ‘painting’ of genes according to properties such as GC content, a pattern search system to identify conserved motifs and batch BLAST searching of every protein encoded by a region. Examples of how the databases have been, and continue to be, used to generate hypotheses for subsequent laboratory investigation are presented. xBASE is available online at http://xbase.bham.ac.uk.
CyBase is a curated database and information source for backbone-cyclized proteins. The database incorporates naturally occurring cyclic proteins as well as synthetic derivatives, grafted analogues and acyclic permutants. The database provides a centralized repository of information on all aspects of cyclic protein biology and addresses issues pertaining to the management and searching of topologically circular sequences. The database is freely available at http://research.imb.uq.edu.au/cybase.
Sequencing and annotation of the entire Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome has made it possible to gain a genome-wide perspective on yeast genes and gene products. To make this information available on an ongoing basis, the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) (http://www.yeastgenome.org/) has created the Genome Snapshot (http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/genomeSnapShot.pl). The Genome Snapshot summarizes the current state of knowledge about the genes and chromosomal features of S.cerevisiae. The information is organized into two categories: (i) number of each type of chromosomal feature annotated in the genome and (ii) number and distribution of genes annotated to Gene Ontology terms. Detailed lists are accessible through SGD's Advanced Search tool (http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/search/featureSearch), and all the data presented on this page are available from the SGD ftp site (ftp://ftp.yeastgenome.org/yeast/).
A comprehensive search that utilized a large set of mRNA data from human genome databases and additionally, expressed sequence tag (EST) database characterized this latest update of AU-rich elements (AREs) containing mRNA database (ARED). A large number of ARE-mRNA, as much as 4000, were recovered and include many of ARE alternative forms. This number represents as much as 5–8% of the human genes depending on the entire number of genes. The new ARED does not contain only larger and diverse number of ARE-mRNAs but additional functionality and enhanced search capabilities are given in the database website http://rc.kfshrc.edu.sa/ared/. These include class and cluster of AREs, source mRNAs, EST evidence, buildup information, retrieval of lists of genes, and integration with current and new NCBI data, such as Entrez ID and Unigene. Gene Ontology analysis shows there are significant differences in functional diversity of ARED when compared with the overall genome. Many of ARE-genes mediate regulatory processes, reactions to outside stimuli, RNA metabolism, and developmental processes particularly those of early and transient responses. The wide interest in mRNA turnover and importance of AREs in health and disease signify the compilation of ARE-genes.
The nuclear receptor signaling (NRS) field has generated a substantial body of information on nuclear receptors, their ligands and coregulators, with the ultimate goal of constructing coherent models of the biological and clinical significance of these molecules. As a component of the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA)—the development of a functional atlas of nuclear receptor biology—the NURSA Bioinformatics Resource is developing a strategy to organize and integrate legacy and future information on these molecules in a single web-based resource (www.nursa.org). This entails parallel efforts of (i) developing an appropriate software framework for handling datasets from NURSA laboratories and (ii) designing strategies for the curation and presentation of public data relevant to NRS. To illustrate our approach, we have described here in detail the development of a web-based interface for the NURSA quantitative PCR nuclear receptor expression dataset, incorporating bioinformatics analysis which provides novel perspectives on functional relationships between these molecules. We anticipate that the free and open access of the community to a platform for data mining and hypothesis generation strategies will be a significant contribution to the progress of research in this field.
FlyBase (http://flybase.org/) is a database of genetic and genomic data on the model organism Drosophila melanogaster and the entire insect family Drosophilidae. The FlyBase Consortium curates, annotates, integrates and maintains a wide variety of data within this domain. Access to the data is provided through graphical and textual user interfaces tailored to particular types of data. FlyBase data types include maps at the cytological, genetic and sequence levels, genes and alleles including their products, functions, expression patterns, mutant phenotypes and genetic interactions as well as aberrant chromosomes, annotated genomes, genetic stock collections, transposons, transgene constructs and insertions, anatomy and images, bibliographic data, and community contact information.
PANDIT is a database of homologous sequence alignments accompanied by estimates of their corresponding phylogenetic trees. It provides a valuable resource to those studying phylogenetic methodology and the evolution of coding-DNA and protein sequences. Currently in version 17.0, PANDIT comprises 7738 families of homologous protein domains; for each family, DNA and corresponding amino acid sequence multiple alignments are available together with high quality phylogenetic tree estimates. Recent improvements include expanded methods for phylogenetic tree inference, assessment of alignment quality and a redesigned web interface, available at the URL http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/pandit.
We present here LOCATE, a curated, web-accessible database that houses data describing the membrane organization and subcellular localization of proteins from the FANTOM3 Isoform Protein Sequence set. Membrane organization is predicted by the high-throughput, computational pipeline MemO. The subcellular locations of selected proteins from this set were determined by a high-throughput, immunofluorescence-based assay and by manually reviewing >1700 peer-reviewed publications. LOCATE represents the first effort to catalogue the experimentally verified subcellular location and membrane organization of mammalian proteins using a high-throughput approach and provides localization data for ∼40% of the mouse proteome. It is available at http://locate.imb.uq.edu.au.
The Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN; http://zfin.org) is a web based community resource that implements the curation of zebrafish genetic, genomic and developmental data. ZFIN provides an integrated representation of mutants, genes, genetic markers, mapping panels, publications and community resources such as meeting announcements and contact information. Recent enhancements to ZFIN include (i) comprehensive curation of gene expression data from the literature and from directly submitted data, (ii) increased support and annotation of the genome sequence, (iii) expanded use of ontologies to support curation and query forms, (iv) curation of morpholino data from the literature, and (v) increased versatility of gene pages, with new data types, links and analysis tools.
dictyBase (http://dictybase.org) is the model organism database (MOD) for the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. The unique biology and phylogenetic position of Dictyostelium offer a great opportunity to gain knowledge of processes not characterized in other organisms. The recent completion of the 34 MB genome sequence, together with the sizable scientific literature using Dictyostelium as a research organism, provided the necessary tools to create a well-annotated genome. dictyBase has leveraged software developed by the Saccharomyces Genome Database and the Generic Model Organism Database project. This has reduced the time required to develop a full-featured MOD and greatly facilitated our ability to focus on annotation and providing new functionality. We hope that manual curation of the Dictyostelium genome will facilitate the annotation of other genomes.
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent one of the most important families of drug targets in pharmaceutical development. GPCR-LIgand DAtabase (GLIDA) is a novel public GPCR-related chemical genomic database that is primarily focused on the correlation of information between GPCRs and their ligands. It provides correlation data between GPCRs and their ligands, along with chemical information on the ligands, as well as access information to the various web databases regarding GPCRs. These data are connected with each other in a relational database, allowing users in the field of GPCR-related drug discovery to easily retrieve such information from either biological or chemical starting points. GLIDA includes structure similarity search functions for the GPCRs and for their ligands. Thus, GLIDA can provide correlation maps linking the searched homologous GPCRs (or ligands) with their ligands (or GPCRs). By analyzing the correlation patterns between GPCRs and ligands, we can gain more detailed knowledge about their interactions and improve drug design efforts by focusing on inferred candidates for GPCR-specific drugs. GLIDA is publicly available at http://gdds.pharm.kyoto-u.ac.jp:8081/glida. We hope that it will prove very useful for chemical genomic research and GPCR-related drug discovery.
Information about the genomic coordinates and the sequence of experimentally identified transcription factor binding sites is found scattered under a variety of diverse formats. The availability of standard collections of such high-quality data is important to design, evaluate and improve novel computational approaches to identify binding motifs on promoter sequences from related genes. ABS (http://genome.imim.es/datasets/abs2005/index.html) is a public database of known binding sites identified in promoters of orthologous vertebrate genes that have been manually curated from bibliography. We have annotated 650 experimental binding sites from 68 transcription factors and 100 orthologous target genes in human, mouse, rat or chicken genome sequences. Computational predictions and promoter alignment information are also provided for each entry. A simple and easy-to-use web interface facilitates data retrieval allowing different views of the information. In addition, the release 1.0 of ABS includes a customizable generator of artificial datasets based on the known sites contained in the collection and an evaluation tool to aid during the training and the assessment of motif-finding programs.
Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (http://www.hprd.org) was developed to serve as a comprehensive collection of protein features, post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein–protein interactions. Since the original report, this database has increased to >20 000 proteins entries and has become the largest database for literature-derived protein–protein interactions (>30 000) and PTMs (>8000) for human proteins. We have also introduced several new features in HPRD including: (i) protein isoforms, (ii) enhanced search options, (iii) linking of pathway annotations and (iv) integration of a novel browser, GenProt Viewer (http://www.genprot.org), developed by us that allows integration of genomic and proteomic information. With the continued support and active participation by the biomedical community, we expect HPRD to become a unique source of curated information for the human proteome and spur biomedical discoveries based on integration of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data.
The Nucleolar Proteome Database (NOPdb) archives data on >700 proteins that were identified by multiple mass spectrometry (MS) analyses from highly purified preparations of human nucleoli, the most prominent nuclear organelle. Each protein entry is annotated with information about its corresponding gene, its domain structures and relevant protein homologues across species, as well as documenting its MS identification history including all the peptides sequenced by tandem MS/MS. Moreover, data showing the quantitative changes in the relative levels of ∼500 nucleolar proteins are compared at different timepoints upon transcriptional inhibition. Correlating changes in protein abundance at multiple timepoints, highlighted by visualization means in the NOPdb, provides clues regarding the potential interactions and relationships between nucleolar proteins and thereby suggests putative functions for factors within the 30% of the proteome which comprises novel/uncharacterized proteins. The NOPdb (http://www.lamondlab.com/NOPdb) is searchable by either gene names, nucleotide or protein sequences, Gene Ontology terms or motifs, or by limiting the range for isoelectric points and/or molecular weights and links to other databases (e.g. LocusLink, OMIM and PubMed).
GenBank (R) is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available DNA sequences for more than 205 000 named organisms, obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects. Most submissions are made using the Web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank staff upon receipt. Daily data exchange with the EMBL Data Library in Europe and the DNA Data Bank of Japan ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through NCBI's retrieval system, Entrez, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. To access GenBank and its related retrieval and analysis services, go to the NCBI Homepage at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
Insertional mutant databases containing Flanking Sequence Tags (FSTs) are becoming key resources for plant functional genomics. We have developed OryGenesDB (http://orygenesdb.cirad.fr/), a database dedicated to rice reverse genetics. Insertion mutants of rice genes are catalogued by Flanking Sequence Tag (FST) information that can be readily accessed by this database. Our database presently contains 44166 FSTs generated by most of the rice insertional mutagenesis projects. The OryGenesDB genome browser is based on the powerful Generic Genome Browser (GGB) developed in the framework of the Generic Model Organism Project (GMOD). The main interface of our web site displays search and analysis interfaces to look for insertions in any candidate gene of interest. Several starting points can be used to exhaustively retrieve the insertions positions and associated genomic information using blast, keywords or gene name search. The toolbox integrated in our database also includes an ‘anchoring’ option that allows immediate mapping and visualization of up to 50 nucleic acid sequences in the rice Genome Browser of OryGenesDB. As a first step toward plant comparative genomics, we have linked the rice and Arabidopsis whole genome using all the predicted pairs of orthologs by best BLAST mutual hit (BBMH) connectors.
Classification of proteins into families of homologous sequences constitutes the basis of functional analysis or of evolutionary studies. Here we present INVertebrate HOmologous GENes (INVHOGEN), a database combining the available invertebrate protein genes from UniProt (consisting of Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL) into gene families. For each family INVHOGEN provides a multiple protein alignment, a maximum likelihood based phylogenetic tree and taxonomic information about the sequences. It is possible to download the corresponding GenBank flatfiles, the alignment and the tree in Newick format. Sequences and related information have been structured in an ACNUC database under a client/server architecture. Thus, complex selections can be performed. An external graphical tool (FamFetch) allows access to the data to evaluate homology relationships between genes and distinguish orthologous from paralogous sequences. Thus, INVHOGEN complements the well-known HOVERGEN database. The databank is available at http://www.bi.uni-duesseldorf.de/~invhogen/invhogen.html.
Phytome is an online comparative genomics resource that can be applied to functional plant genomics, molecular breeding and evolutionary studies. It contains predicted protein sequences, protein family assignments, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenies and functional annotations for proteins from a large, phylogenetically diverse set of plant taxa. Phytome serves as a glue between disparate plant gene databases both by identifying the evolutionary relationships among orthologous and paralogous protein sequences from different species and by enabling cross-references between different versions of the same gene curated independently by different database groups. The web interface enables sophisticated queries on lineage-specific patterns of gene/protein family proliferation and loss. This rich dataset is serving as a platform for the unification of sequence-anchored comparative maps across taxonomic families of plants. The Phytome web interface can be accessed at the following URL: http://www.phytome.org. Batch homology searches and bulk downloads are available upon free registration.
VIPERdb (http://viperdb.scripps.edu) is a database for icosahedral virus capsid structures. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive resource specific to the needs of the structural virology community, with an emphasis on the description and comparison of derived data from structural and energetic analyses of capsids. A relational database implementation based on a schema for macromolecular structure makes the data highly accessible to the user, allowing detailed queries at the atomic level. Together with curation practices that maintain data uniformity, this will facilitate structural bioinformatics studies of virus capsids. User friendly search, visualization and educational tools on the website allow both structural and derived data to be examined easily and extensively. Links to relevant literature, sequence and taxonomy databases are provided for each entry.
Antisense oligonucleotides (ODNs) technology is one of the important approaches for the sequence-specific knockdown of gene expression. ODNs have been used as research tools in the post-genome era, as well as new types of therapeutic agents. Since finding effective target sites within RNA is a hard work for antisense ODNs design, various experimental methods and computational approaches have been proposed. For better sharing of the experimented and published ODNs, valid and invalid ODNs reported in literatures are screened, collected and stored in AOBase. Till now, ∼700 ODNs against 46 target mRNAs are contained in AOBase. Entries can be explored via TargetSearch and AOSearch web retrieval interfaces. AOBase can not only be useful in ODNs selection for gene function exploration, but also contribute to mining rules and developing algorithms for rational ODNs design. AOBase is freely accessible via http://www.bioit.org.cn/ao/aobase.
The RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) offers online tools, summary reports and target information related to the worldwide structural genomics initiatives from its portal at http://sg.pdb.org. There are currently three components to this site: Structural Genomics Initiatives contains information and links on each structural genomics site, including progress reports, target lists, target status, targets in the PDB and level of sequence redundancy; Targets provides combined target information, protocols and other data associated with protein structure determination; and Structures offers an assessment of the progress of structural genomics based on the functional coverage of the human genome by PDB structures, structural genomics targets and homology models. Functional coverage can be examined according to enzyme classification, gene ontology (biological process, cell component and molecular function) and disease.
Guanine-rich nucleic acids are known to form highly stable G-quadruplex structures, also known as G-quartets. Recently, there has been a tremendous amount of interest in studying G-quadruplexes owing to the realization of their biological importance. G-rich sequences (GRSs) capable of forming G-quadruplexes are found in the vicinity of polyadenylation regions and are involved in regulating 3′ end processing of mammalian pre-mRNAs. G-rich motifs are also known to play an important role in alternative, tissue-specific splicing by interacting with hnRNP H protein subfamily. Whether quadruplex structure directly plays a role in regulating RNA processing events requires further investigation. To date there has not been a comprehensive effort to study G-quadruplexes near RNA processing sites. We have applied a computational approach to map putative Quadruplex forming GRSs within the transcribed regions of a large number of alternatively processed human and mouse gene sequences that were obtained as fully annotated entries from GenBank and RefSeq. We have used the computed data to build the GRSDB database that provides a unique avenue for studying G-quadruplexes in the context of RNA processing sites. GRSDB website offers visual comparison of G-quadruplex distribution patterns among all the alternative RNA products of a gene with the help of dynamic graphics. At present, GRSDB contains data from 1310 human and mouse genes, of which 1188 are alternatively processed. It has a total of 379 223 predicted G-quadruplexes, of which 54 252 are near RNA processing sites. GRSDB is a good resource for researchers interested in investigating the functional relevance of G-quadruplexes, especially in the context of alternative RNA processing. It can be accessed at http://bioinformatics.ramapo.edu/grsdb/.
DRASTIC––Database Resource for the Analysis of Signal Transduction In Cells (http://www.drastic.org.uk/) has been created as a first step towards a data-based approach for constructing signal transduction pathways. DRASTIC is a relational database of plant expressed sequence tags and genes up- or down-regulated in response to various pathogens, chemical exposure or other treatments such as drought, salt and low temperature. More than 17700 records have been obtained from 306 treatments affecting 73 plant species from 512 peer-reviewed publications with most emphasis being placed on data from Arabidopsis thaliana. DRASTIC has been developed by the Scottish Crop Research Institute and the University of Abertay Dundee and allows rapid identification of plant genes that are up- or down-regulated by multiple treatments and those that are regulated by a very limited (or perhaps a single) treatment. The INSIGHTS (INference of cell SIGnaling HypoTheseS) suite of web-based tools allows intelligent data mining and extraction of information from the DRASTIC database. Potential response pathways can be visualized and comparisons made between gene expression patterns in response to various treatments. The knowledge gained informs plant signalling pathways and systems biology investigations.
The integrated microbial genomes (IMG) system is a new data management and analysis platform for microbial genomes provided by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI). IMG contains both draft and complete JGI genomes integrated with other publicly available microbial genomes of all three domains of life. IMG provides tools and viewers for analyzing genomes, genes and functions, individually or in a comparative context. IMG allows users to focus their analysis on subsets of genes and genomes of interest and to save the results of their analysis. IMG is available at http://img.jgi.doe.gov.
The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) provides a central resource on protein sequences and functional annotation with three database components, each addressing a key need in protein bioinformatics. The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), comprising the manually annotated UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot section and the automatically annotated UniProtKB/TrEMBL section, is the preeminent storehouse of protein annotation. The extensive cross-references, functional and feature annotations and literature-based evidence attribution enable scientists to analyse proteins and query across databases. The UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) speed similarity searches via sequence space compression by merging sequences that are 100% (UniRef100), 90% (UniRef90) or 50% (UniRef50) identical. Finally, the UniProt Archive (UniParc) stores all publicly available protein sequences, containing the history of sequence data with links to the source databases. UniProt databases continue to grow in size and in availability of information. Recent and upcoming changes to database contents, formats, controlled vocabularies and services are described. New download availability includes all major releases of UniProtKB, sequence collections by taxonomic division and complete proteomes. A bibliography mapping service has been added, and an ID mapping service will be available soon. UniProt databases can be accessed online at http://www.uniprot.org or downloaded at ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/.
Natural oligopeptides may regulate nearly all vital processes. To date, the chemical structures of nearly 6000 oligopeptides have been identified from >1000 organisms representing all the biological kingdoms. We have compiled the known physical, chemical and biological properties of these oligopeptides—whether synthesized on ribosomes or by non-ribosomal enzymes—and have constructed an internet-accessible database, EROP-Moscow (Endogenous Regulatory OligoPeptides), which resides at http://erop.inbi.ras.ru. This database enables users to perform rapid searches via many key features of the oligopeptides, and to carry out statistical analysis of all the available information. The database lists only those oligopeptides whose chemical structures have been completely determined (directly or by translation from nucleotide sequences). It provides extensive links with the Swiss-Prot-TrEMBL peptide-protein database, as well as with the PubMed biomedical bibliographic database. EROP-Moscow also contains data on many oligopeptides that are absent from other convenient databases, and is designed for extended use in classifying new natural oligopeptides and for production of novel peptide pharmaceuticals.
TRANSPATH® is a database about signal transduction events. It provides information about signaling molecules, their reactions and the pathways these reactions constitute. The representation of signaling molecules is organized in a number of orthogonal hierarchies reflecting the classification of the molecules, their species-specific or generic features, and their post-translational modifications. Reactions are similarly hierarchically organized in a three-layer architecture, differentiating between reactions that are evidenced by individual publications, generalizations of these reactions to construct species-independent ‘reference pathways’ and the ‘semantic projections’ of these pathways. A number of search and browse options allow easy access to the database contents, which can be visualized with the tool PathwayBuilder™. The module PathoSign adds data about pathologically relevant mutations in signaling components, including their genotypes and phenotypes. TRANSPATH® and PathoSign can be used as encyclopaedia, in the educational process, for vizualization and modeling of signal transduction networks and for the analysis of gene expression data. TRANSPATH® Public 6.0 is freely accessible for users from non-profit organizations under http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/databases.html.
The VBI Microbial Database (VMD) is a database system designed to host a range of microbial genome sequences. At present, the database contains genome sequence and annotation data of two plant pathogens Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora ramorum. With the completion of the draft genome sequences of these pathogens in collaboration with the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI), we have created this resource to make the sequences publicly available. The genome sequences (95 MB for P.sojae and 65 MB for P.ramorum) were annotated with ∼19 000 and ∼16 000 gene models, respectively. We used two different statistical methods to validate these gene models, Fickett's and a log-likelihood method. Functional annotation of the gene models is based on results from BlastX and InterProScan screens. From the InterProScan results, we could assign putative functions to 17 694 genes in P.sojae and 14 700 genes in P.ramorum. We created an easy-to-use genome browser to view the genome sequence data, which opens to detailed annotation pages for each gene model. A community annotation interface is available for registered community members to add or edit annotations. There are ∼ 1600 gene models for P.sojae and ∼700 models for P.ramorum that have already been manually curated. A toolkit is provided as an additional resource for users to perform a variety of sequence analysis jobs. The database is publicly available at http://phytophthora.vbi.vt.edu/.
The Arabs comprise a genetically heterogeneous group that resulted from the admixture of different populations throughout history. They share many common characteristics responsible for a considerable proportion of perinatal and neonatal mortalities. To this end, the Centre for Arab Genomic Studies (CAGS) launched a pilot project to construct the ‘Catalogue of Transmission Genetics in Arabs’ (CTGA) database for genetic disorders in Arabs. Information in CTGA is drawn from published research and mined hospital records. The database offers web-based basic and advanced search approaches. In either case, the final search result is a detailed HTML record that includes text-, URL- and graphic-based fields. At present, CTGA hosts entries for 692 phenotypes and 235 related genes described in Arab individuals. Of these, 213 phenotypic descriptions and 22 related genes were observed in the Arab population of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These results emphasize the role of CTGA as an essential tool to promote scientific research on genetic disorders in the region. The priority of CTGA is to provide timely information on the occurrence of genetic disorders in Arab individuals. It is anticipated that data from Arab countries other than the UAE will be exhaustively searched and incorporated in CTGA (http://www.cags.org.ae).
In recent years, the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) yeast protein–protein interaction (PPI) dataset has been used in numerous analyses of protein networks and has been called a gold standard because of its quality and comprehensiveness [H. Yu, N. M. Luscombe, H. X. Lu, X. Zhu, Y. Xia, J. D. Han, N. Bertin, S. Chung, M. Vidal and M. Gerstein (2004) Genome Res., 14, 1107–1118]. MPact and the yeast protein localization catalog provide information related to the proximity of proteins in yeast. Beside the integration of high-throughput data, information about experimental evidence for PPIs in the literature was compiled by experts adding up to 4300 distinct PPIs connecting 1500 proteins in yeast. As the interaction data is a complementary part of CYGD, interactive mapping of data on other integrated data types such as the functional classification catalog [A. Ruepp, A. Zollner, D. Maier, K. Albermann, J. Hani, M. Mokrejs, I. Tetko, U. Güldener, G. Mannhaupt, M. Münsterkötter and H. W. Mewes (2004) Nucleic Acids Res., 32, 5539–5545] is possible. A survey of signaling proteins and comparison with pathway data from KEGG demonstrates that based on these manually annotated data only an extensive overview of the complexity of this functional network can be obtained in yeast. The implementation of a web-based PPI-analysis tool allows analysis and visualization of protein interaction networks and facilitates integration of our curated data with high-throughput datasets. The complete dataset as well as user-defined sub-networks can be retrieved easily in the standardized PSI-MI format. The resource can be accessed through http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/mpact.
In the past year, DDBJ (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) collected and released 1 956 826 entries or 1 741 313 111 bases. The released data include ∼90 000 ESTs and cDNAs of Macaca fascicularis, and 280 million bases of mouse GSS. In addition to the data collection, we have indexed the submitted data to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, http://www.insdc.org) to classify the entries into research projects behind data submissions. They are expected to be useful to the data submitters and users for enhancing the data submission, retrieval and systematic data analyses at INSDC. The results of indexing also allow one to grasp research projects in life sciences that promoted and produced the DNA sequences submitted to INSDC.
We have developed a web-based resource (available at www.ciliate.org) for researchers studying the model ciliate organism Tetrahymena thermophila. Employing the underlying database structure and programming of the Saccharomyces Genome Database, the Tetrahymena Genome Database (TGD) integrates the wealth of knowledge generated by the Tetrahymena research community about genome structure, genes and gene products with the newly sequenced macronuclear genome determined by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). TGD provides information curated from the literature about each published gene, including a standardized gene name, a link to the genomic locus in our graphical genome browser, gene product annotations utilizing the Gene Ontology, links to published literature about the gene and more. TGD also displays automatic annotations generated for the gene models predicted by TIGR. A variety of tools are available at TGD for searching the Tetrahymena genome, its literature and information about members of the research community.
The database, CryptoDB (http://CryptoDB.org), is a community bioinformatics resource for the AIDS-related apicomplexan-parasite, Cryptosporidium. CryptoDB integrates whole genome sequence and annotation with expressed sequence tag and genome survey sequence data and provides supplemental bioinformatics analyses and data-mining tools. A simple, yet comprehensive web interface is available for mining and visualizing the data. CryptoDB is allied with the databases PlasmoDB and ToxoDB via ApiDB, an NIH/NIAID-fundedBioinformatics Resource Center. Recent updates to CryptoDB include the deposition of annotated genome sequences for Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis, migration to a relational database (GUS), a new query and visualization interface and the introduction of Web services.
Gene trapping is a method of generating murine embryonic stem (ES) cell lines containing insertional mutations in known and novel genes. A number of international groups have used this approach to create sizeable public cell line repositories available to the scientific community for the generation of mutant mouse strains. The major gene trapping groups worldwide have recently joined together to centralize access to all publicly available gene trap lines by developing a user-oriented Website for the International Gene Trap Consortium (IGTC). This collaboration provides an impressive public informatics resource comprising ∼45 000 well-characterized ES cell lines which currently represent ∼40% of known mouse genes, all freely available for the creation of knockout mice on a non-collaborative basis. To standardize annotation and provide high confidence data for gene trap lines, a rigorous identification and annotation pipeline has been developed combining genomic localization and transcript alignment of gene trap sequence tags to identify trapped loci. This information is stored in a new bioinformatics database accessible through the IGTC Website interface. The IGTC Website (www.genetrap.org) allows users to browse and search the database for trapped genes, BLAST sequences against gene trap sequence tags, and view trapped genes within biological pathways. In addition, IGTC data have been integrated into major genome browsers and bioinformatics sites to provide users with outside portals for viewing this data. The development of the IGTC Website marks a major advance by providing the research community with the data and tools necessary to effectively use public gene trap resources for the large-scale characterization of mammalian gene function.
IRESite is an exhaustive, manually annotated non-redundant relational database focused on the IRES elements (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) and containing information not available in the primary public databases. IRES elements were originally found in eukaryotic viruses hijacking initiation of translation of their host. Later on, they were also discovered in 5′-untranslated regions of some eukaryotic mRNA molecules. Currently, IRESite presents up to 92 biologically relevant aspects of every experiment, e.g. the nature of an IRES element, its functionality/defectivity, origin, size, sequence, structure, its relative position with respect to surrounding protein coding regions, positive/negative controls used in the experiment, the reporter genes used to monitor IRES activity, the measured reporter protein yields/activities, and references to original publications as well as cross-references to other databases, and also comments from submitters and our curators. Furthermore, the site presents the known similarities to rRNA sequences as well as RNA–protein interactions. Special care is given to the annotation of promoter-like regions. The annotated data in IRESite are bound to mostly complete, full-length mRNA, and whenever possible, accompanied by original plasmid vector sequences. New data can be submitted through the publicly available web-based interface at http://www.iresite.org and are curated by a team of lab-experienced biologists.
AffinDB is a database of affinity data for structurally resolved protein–ligand complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It is freely accessible at http://www.agklebe.de/affinity. Affinity data are collected from the scientific literature, both from primary sources describing the original experimental work of affinity determination and from secondary references which report affinity values determined by others. AffinDB currently contains over 730 affinity entries covering more than 450 different protein–ligand complexes. Besides the affinity value, PDB summary information and additional data are provided, including the experimental conditions of the affinity measurement (if available in the corresponding reference); 2D drawing, SMILES code and molecular weight of the ligand; links to other databases, and bibliographic information. AffinDB can be queried by PDB code or by any combination of affinity range, temperature and pH value of the measurement, ligand molecular weight, and publication data (author, journal and year). Search results can be saved as tabular reports in text files. The database is supposed to be a valuable resource for researchers interested in biomolecular recognition and the development of tools for correlating structural data with affinities, as needed, for example, in structure-based drug design.
Chromosome translocation and gene fusion are frequent events in the human genome and are often the cause of many types of tumor. ChimerDB is the database of fusion sequences encompassing bioinformatics analysis of mRNA and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences in the GenBank, manual collection of literature data and integration with other known database such as OMIM. Our bioinformatics analysis identifies the fusion transcripts that have non-overlapping alignments at multiple genomic loci. Fusion events at exon–exon borders are selected to filter out the cloning artifacts in cDNA library preparation. The result is classified into two groups—genuine chromosome translocation and fusion between neighboring genes owing to intergenic splicing. We also integrated manually collected literature and OMIM data for chromosome translocation as an aid to assess the validity of each fusion event. The database is available at http://genome.ewha.ac.kr/ChimerDB/ for human, mouse and rat genomes.
Metal ions are essential for the folding of RNA into stable tertiary structures and for the catalytic activity of some RNA enzymes. To aid in the study of the roles of metal ions in RNA structural biology, we have created MeRNA (Metals in RNA), a comprehensive compilation of all metal binding sites identified in RNA 3D structures available from the PDB and Nucleic Acid Database. Currently, our database contains information relating to binding of 9764 metal ions corresponding to 23 distinct elements, in 256 RNA structures. The metal ion locations were confirmed and ligands characterized using original literature references. MeRNA includes eight manually identified metal-ion binding motifs, which are described in the literature. MeRNA is searchable by PDB identifier, metal ion, method of structure determination, resolution and R-values for X-ray structure and distance from metal to any RNA atom or to water. New structures with their respective binding motifs will be added to the database as they become available. The MeRNA database will further our understanding of the roles of metal ions in RNA folding and catalysis and have applications in structural and functional analysis, RNA design and engineering. The MeRNA database is accessible at http://merna.lbl.gov.
DPVweb (http://www.dpvweb.net/) provides a central source of information about viruses, viroids and satellites of plants, fungi and protozoa. Comprehensive taxonomic information, including brief descriptions of each family and genus, and classified lists of virus sequences are provided. The database also holds detailed, curated, information for all sequences of viruses, viroids and satellites of plants, fungi and protozoa that are complete or that contain at least one complete gene (currently, n ≈ 9000). For comparative purposes, it also contains a single representative sequence of all other fully sequenced virus species with an RNA or single-stranded DNA genome. The start and end positions of each feature (gene, non-translated region and the like) have been recorded and checked for accuracy. As far as possible, nomenclature for genes and proteins are standardized within genera and families. Sequences of features (either as DNA or amino acid sequences) can be directly downloaded from the website in FASTA format. The sequence information can also be accessed via client software for PC computers (freely downloadable from the website) that enable users to make an easy selection of sequences and features of a chosen virus for further analyses.
MfunGD (http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/mfungd/) provides a resource for annotated mouse proteins and their occurrence in protein networks. Manual annotation concentrates on proteins which are found to interact physically with other proteins. Accordingly, manually curated information from a protein–protein interaction database (MPPI) and a database of mammalian protein complexes is interconnected with MfunGD. Protein function annotation is performed using the Functional Catalogue (FunCat) annotation scheme which is widely used for the analysis of protein networks. The dataset is also supplemented with information about the literature that was used in the annotation process as well as links to the SIMAP Fasta database, the Pedant protein analysis system and cross-references to external resources. Proteins that so far were not manually inspected are annotated automatically by a graphical probabilistic model and/or superparamagnetic clustering. The database is continuously expanding to include the rapidly growing amount of functional information about gene products from mouse. MfunGD is implemented in GenRE, a J2EE-based component-oriented multi-tier architecture following the separation of concern principle.
Regulation of gene expression influences almost all biological processes in an organism; sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors are critical to this control. For most genomes, the repertoire of transcription factors is only partially known. Hitherto transcription factor identification has been largely based on genome annotation pipelines that use pairwise sequence comparisons, which detect only those factors similar to known genes, or on functional classification schemes that amalgamate many types of proteins into the category of ‘transcription factor’. Using a novel transcription factor identification method, the DBD transcription factor database fills this void, providing genome-wide transcription factor predictions for organisms from across the tree of life. The prediction method behind DBD identifies sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors through homology using profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) of domains. Thus, it is limited to factors that are homologus to those HMMs. The collection of HMMs is taken from two existing databases (Pfam and SUPERFAMILY), and is limited to models that exclusively detect transcription factors that specifically recognize DNA sequences. It does not include basal transcription factors or chromatin-associated proteins, for instance. Based on comparison with experimentally verified annotation, the prediction procedure is between 95% and 99% accurate. Between one quarter and one-half of our genome-wide predicted transcription factors represent previously uncharacterized proteins. The DBD (www.transcriptionfactor.org) consists of predicted transcription factor repertoires for 150 completely sequenced genomes, their domain assignments and the hand curated list of DNA-binding domain HMMs. Users can browse, search or download the predictions by genome, domain family or sequence identifier, view families of transcription factors based on domain architecture and receive predictions for a protein sequence.
There are many components which govern the function of a protein within a cell. Here, we focus on the molecular recognition of small molecules and the prediction of common recognition by similarity between protein–ligand binding sites. SitesBase is an easily accessible database which is simple to use and holds information about structural similarities between known ligand binding sites found in the Protein Data Bank. These similarities are presented to the wider community enabling full analysis of molecular recognition and potentially protein structure–function relationships. SitesBase is accessible at http://www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/sb.
The MitoP2 database (http://www.mitop.de) integrates information on mitochondrial proteins, their molecular functions and associated diseases. The central database features are manually annotated reference proteins localized or functionally associated with mitochondria supplied for yeast, human and mouse. MitoP2 enables (i) the identification of putative orthologous proteins between these species to study evolutionarily conserved functions and pathways; (ii) the integration of data from systematic genome-wide studies such as proteomics and deletion phenotype screening; (iii) the prediction of novel mitochondrial proteins using data integration and the assignment of evidence scores; and (iv) systematic searches that aim to find the genes that underlie common and rare mitochondrial diseases. The data and analysis files are referenced to data sources in PubMed and other online databases and can be easily downloaded. MitoP2 users can explore the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunctions and disease and utilize this information to conduct systems biology approaches on mitochondria.
The Protein pKa Database (PPD) v1.0 provides a compendium of protein residue-specific ionization equilibria (pKa values), as collated from the primary literature, in the form of a web-accessible postgreSQL relational database. Ionizable residues play key roles in the molecular mechanisms that underlie many biological phenomena, including protein folding and enzyme catalysis. The PPD serves as a general protein pKa archive and as a source of data that allows for the development and improvement of pKa prediction systems. The database is accessed through an HTML interface, which offers two fast, efficient search methods: an amino acid-based query and a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search. Entries also give details of experimental techniques and links to other key databases, such as National Center for Biotechnology Information and the Protein Data Bank, providing the user with considerable background information. The database can be found at the following URL: http://www.jenner.ac.uk/PPD.
Cap-analysis gene expression (CAGE) Basic and Analysis Databases store an original resource produced by CAGE, which measures expression levels of transcription starting sites by sequencing large amounts of transcript 5′ ends, termed CAGE tags. Millions of human and mouse high-quality CAGE tags derived from different conditions in >20 tissues consisting of >250 RNA samples are essential for identification of novel promoters and promoter characterization in the aspect of expression profile. CAGE Basic Database is a primary database of the CAGE resource, RNA samples, CAGE libraries, CAGE clone and tag sequences and so on. CAGE Analysis Database stores promoter related information, such as counts of related transcripts, CpG islands and conserved genome region. It also provides expression profiles at base pair and promoter levels. Both databases are based on the same framework, CAGE tag starting sites, tag clusters for defining promoters and transcriptional units (TUs). Their associations and TU attributes are available to find promoters of interest. These databases were provided for Functional Annotation Of Mouse 3 (FANTOM3), an international collaboration research project focusing on expanding the transcriptome and subsequent analyses. Now access is free for all users through the World Wide Web at http://fantom3.gsc.riken.jp/.
The PROSITE database consists of a large collection of biologically meaningful signatures that are described as patterns or profiles. Each signature is linked to a documentation that provides useful biological information on the protein family, domain or functional site identified by the signature. The PROSITE database is now complemented by a series of rules that can give more precise information about specific residues. During the last 2 years, the documentation and the ScanProsite web pages were redesigned to add more functionalities. The latest version of PROSITE (release 19.11 of September 27, 2005) contains 1329 patterns and 552 profile entries. Over the past 2 years more than 200 domains have been added, and now 52% of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries (release 48.1 of September 27, 2005) have a cross-reference to a PROSITE entry. The database is accessible at http://www.expasy.org/prosite/.
Pathguide: the Pathway Resource List (http://pathguide.org) is a meta-database that provides an overview of more than 190 web-accessible biological pathway and network databases. These include databases on metabolic pathways, signaling pathways, transcription factor targets, gene regulatory networks, genetic interactions, protein–compound interactions, and protein–protein interactions. The listed databases are maintained by diverse groups in different locations and the information in them is derived either from the scientific literature or from systematic experiments. Pathguide is useful as a starting point for biological pathway analysis and for content aggregation in integrated biological information systems.
We describe cisRED, a database for conserved regulatory elements that are identified and ranked by a genome-scale computational system (www.cisred.org). The database and high-throughput predictive pipeline are designed to address diverse target genomes in the context of rapidly evolving data resources and tools. Motifs are predicted in promoter regions using multiple discovery methods applied to sequence sets that include corresponding sequence regions from vertebrates. We estimate motif significance by applying discovery and post-processing methods to randomized sequence sets that are adaptively derived from target sequence sets, retain motifs with p-values below a threshold and identify groups of similar motifs and co-occurring motif patterns. The database offers information on atomic motifs, motif groups and patterns. It is web-accessible, and can be queried directly, downloaded or installed locally.
The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (www.ebi.ac.uk/embl) at the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, UK, offers a comprehensive set of publicly available nucleotide sequence and annotation, freely accessible to all. Maintained in collaboration with partners DDBJ and GenBank, coverage includes whole genome sequencing project data, directly submitted sequence, sequence recorded in support of patent applications and much more. The database continues to offer submission tools, data retrieval facilities and user support. In 2005, the volume of data offered has continued to grow exponentially. In addition to the newly presented data, the database encompasses a range of new data types generated by novel technologies, offers enhanced presentation and searchability of the data and has greater integration with other data resources offered at the EBI and elsewhere. In stride with these developing data types, the database has continued to develop submission and retrieval tools to maximise the information content of submitted data and to offer the simplest possible submission routes for data producers. New developments, the submission process, data retrieval and access to support are presented in this paper, along with links to sources of further information.
Transcriptome microarrays have become one of the tools of choice for investigating the genes involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, as well as finding new biomarkers and gene expression signatures for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Here, we describe a new database for Integrated Tumor Transcriptome Array and Clinical data Analysis (ITTACA). ITTACA centralizes public datasets containing both gene expression and clinical data. ITTACA currently focuses on the types of cancer that are of particular interest to research teams at Institut Curie: breast carcinoma, bladder carcinoma and uveal melanoma. A web interface allows users to carry out different class comparison analyses, including the comparison of expression distribution profiles, tests for differential expression and patient survival analyses. ITTACA is complementary to other databases, such as GEO and SMD, because it offers a better integration of clinical data and different functionalities. It also offers more options for class comparison analyses when compared with similar projects such as Oncomine. For example, users can define their own patient groups according to clinical data or gene expression levels. This added flexibility and the user-friendly web interface makes ITTACA especially useful for comparing personal results with the results in the existing literature. ITTACA is accessible online at http://bioinfo.curie.fr/ittaca.
MODBASE (http://salilab.org/modbase) is a database of annotated comparative protein structure models for all available protein sequences that can be matched to at least one known protein structure. The models are calculated by MODPIPE, an automated modeling pipeline that relies on MODELLER for fold assignment, sequence–structure alignment, model building and model assessment (http:/salilab.org/modeller). MODBASE is updated regularly to reflect the growth in protein sequence and structure databases, and improvements in the software for calculating the models. MODBASE currently contains 3 094 524 reliable models for domains in 1 094 750 out of 1 817 889 unique protein sequences in the UniProt database (July 5, 2005); only models based on statistically significant alignments and models assessed to have the correct fold despite insignificant alignments are included. MODBASE also allows users to generate comparative models for proteins of interest with the automated modeling server MODWEB (http://salilab.org/modweb). Our other resources integrated with MODBASE include comprehensive databases of multiple protein structure alignments (DBAli, http://salilab.org/dbali), structurally defined ligand binding sites and structurally defined binary domain interfaces (PIBASE, http://salilab.org/pibase) as well as predictions of ligand binding sites, interactions between yeast proteins, and functional consequences of human nsSNPs (LS-SNP, http://salilab.org/LS-SNP).
The database of multiple alignments for protein structures (DMAPS) provides instant access to pre-computed multiple structure alignments for all protein structure families in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Protein structure families have been obtained from four distinct classification methods including SCOP, CATH, ENZYME and CE, and multiple structure alignments have been built for all families containing at least three members, using CE-MC software. Currently, multiple structure alignments are available for 3050 SCOP-, 3087 CATH-, 664 ENZYME- and 1707 CE-based families. A web-based query system has been developed to retrieve multiple alignments for these families using the PDB chain ID of any member of a family. Multiple alignments can be viewed or downloaded in six different formats, including JOY/html, TEXT, FASTA, PDB (superimposed coordinates), JOY/postscript and JOY/rtf. DMAPS is accessible online at http://bioinformatics.albany.edu/~dmaps.
FLIGHT (www.flight.licr.org) is a new database designed to help researchers browse and cross-correlate data from large-scale RNAi studies. To date, the majority of these functional genomic screens have been carried out using Drosophila cell lines. These RNAi screens follow 100 years of classical Drosophila genetics, but have already revealed their potential by ascribing an impressive number of functions to known and novel genes. This has in turn given rise to a pressing need for tools to simplify the analysis of the large amount of phenotypic information generated. FLIGHT aims to do this by providing users with a gene-centric view of screen results and by making it possible to cluster phenotypic data to identify genes with related functions. Additionally, FLIGHT provides microarray expression data for many of the Drosophila cell lines commonly used in RNAi screens. This, together with information about cell lines, protocols and dsRNA primer sequences, is intended to help researchers design their own cell-based screens. Finally, although the current focus of FLIGHT is Drosophila, the database has been designed to facilitate the comparison of functional data across species and to help researchers working with other systems navigate their way through the fly genome.
A large proportion of proteins expressed in Escherichia coli form inclusion bodies and thus require renaturation to attain a functional conformation for analysis. In this process, identifying and optimizing the refolding conditions and methodology is often rate limiting. In order to address this problem, we have developed REFOLD, a web-accessible relational database containing the published methods employed in the refolding of recombinant proteins. Currently, REFOLD contains >300 entries, which are heavily annotated such that the database can be searched via multiple parameters. We anticipate that REFOLD will continue to grow and eventually become a powerful tool for the optimization of protein renaturation. REFOLD is freely available at http://refold.med.monash.edu.au.
The Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) is an online resource (http://smart.embl.de/) used for protein domain identification and the analysis of protein domain architectures. Many new features were implemented to make SMART more accessible to scientists from different fields. The new ‘Genomic’ mode in SMART makes it easy to analyze domain architectures in completely sequenced genomes. Domain annotation has been updated with a detailed taxonomic breakdown and a prediction of the catalytic activity for 50 SMART domains is now available, based on the presence of essential amino acids. Furthermore, intrinsically disordered protein regions can be identified and displayed. The network context is now displayed in the results page for more than 350 000 proteins, enabling easy analyses of domain interactions.
The Chloroplast Genome Database (ChloroplastDB) is an interactive, web-based database for fully sequenced plastid genomes, containing genomic, protein, DNA and RNA sequences, gene locations, RNA-editing sites, putative protein families and alignments (http://chloroplast.cbio.psu.edu/). With recent technical advances, the rate of generating new organelle genomes has increased dramatically. However, the established ontology for chloroplast genes and gene features has not been uniformly applied to all chloroplast genomes available in the sequence databases. For example, annotations for some published genome sequences have not evolved with gene naming conventions. ChloroplastDB provides unified annotations, gene name search, BLAST and download functions for chloroplast encoded genes and genomic sequences. A user can retrieve all orthologous sequences with one search regardless of gene names in GenBank. This feature alone greatly facilitates comparative research on sequence evolution including changes in gene content, codon usage, gene structure and post-transcriptional modifications such as RNA editing. Orthologous protein sets are classified by TribeMCL and each set is assigned a standard gene name. Over the next few years, as the number of sequenced chloroplast genomes increases rapidly, the tools available in ChloroplastDB will allow researchers to easily identify and compile target data for comparative analysis of chloroplast genes and genomes.
The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) aims to give every human gene a unique and ideally meaningful name and symbol. The HGNC database, previously known as Genew, contains over 22 000 public records with approved human gene nomenclature and associated information. The database has undergone major improvements throughout the last year, is publicly available for online searching at http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nomenclature/searchgenes.pl and has a new custom downloads interface at http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nomenclature/gdlw.pl.
The snoRNA-LBME-db is a dedicated database containing human C/D box and H/ACA box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs). C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs are part of ribonucleoparticles that guide 2′-O-ribose methylation and pseudouridilation, respectively, of selected residues of 28S, 18S or 5.8S rRNAs or of the spliceosomal U6 RNA. Similarly, scaRNAs guide modifications of the spliceosomal RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U12) and are often composed of both C/D box and H/ACA box domains. However, some snoRNAs do not function as modification guide RNAs, but rather as RNA chaperones during the maturation of pre-rRNA. The database was built by a compilation of the literature, and comprises human sno/scaRNAs that were experimentally verified, as well as the human orthologs of snoRNAs that were cloned in other vertebrate species, and some snoRNAs that are predicted by bioinformatics search in loci submitted to genomic imprinting, but have not all been experimentally verified. For each entry, the database identifies the modified nucleotide(s) in the target RNA(s), indicates the corresponding predicted base pairing, gives a few pertinent references and provides a link to the position of the sno/scaRNA on the UCSC Genome Browser. The ‘Find guide RNA’ function allows one to find the sno/scaRNAs predicted to guide the modification of a particular nucleotide in the rRNA and spliceosomal RNA sequences. The ‘Browse’ function allows one to download the sequences of selected sno/scaRNAs in the FASTA format. The database is available online at http://www-snorna.biotoul.fr/. It can also be accessed from the human UCSC Genome Browser via the sno/miRNA track.
The SNP500Cancer database provides sequence and genotype assay information for candidate SNPs useful in mapping complex diseases, such as cancer. The database is an integral component of the NCI Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov). SNP500Cancer reports sequence analysis of anonymized control DNA samples (n = 102 Coriell samples representing four self-described ethnic groups: African/African-American, Caucasian, Hispanic and Pacific Rim). The website is searchable by gene, chromosome, gene ontology pathway, dbSNP ID and SNP500Cancer SNP ID. As of October 2005, the database contains >13 400 SNPs, 9124 of which have been sequenced in the SNP500Cancer population. For each analysed SNP, gene location and >200 bp of surrounding annotated sequence (including nearby SNPs) are provided, with frequency information in total and per subpopulation as well as calculation of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for each subpopulation. The website provides the conditions for validated sequencing and genotyping assays, as well as genotype results for the 102 samples, in both viewable and downloadable formats. A subset of sequence validated SNPs with minor allele frequency >5% are entered into a high-throughput pipeline for genotyping analysis to determine concordance for the same 102 samples. In addition, the results of genotype analysis for select validated SNP assays (defined as 100% concordance between sequence analysis and genotype results) are posted for an additional 280 samples drawn from the Human Diversity Panel (HDP). SNP500Cancer provides an invaluable resource for investigators to select SNPs for analysis, design genotyping assays using validated sequence data, choose selected assays already validated on one or more genotyping platforms, and select reference standards for genotyping assays. The SNP500Cancer database is freely accessible via the web page at http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov.
ISfinder (www-is.biotoul.fr) is a dedicated database for bacterial insertion sequences (ISs). It has superseded the Stanford reference center. One of its functions is to assign IS names and to provide a focal point for a coherent nomenclature. It is also the repository for ISs. Each new IS is indexed together with information such as its DNA sequence and open reading frames or potential coding sequences, the sequence of the ends of the element and target sites, its origin and distribution together with a bibliography where available. Another objective is to continuously monitor ISs to provide updated comprehensive groupings or families and to provide some insight into their phylogenies. The site also contains extensive background information on ISs and transposons in general. Online tools are gradually being added. At present an online Blast facility against the entire bank is available. But additional features will include alignment capability, PsiBLAST and HMM profiles. ISfinder also includes a section on bacterial genomes and is involved in annotating the IS content of these genomes. Finally, this database is currently recommended by several microbiology journals for registration of new IS elements before their publication.
Similarity Matrix of Proteins (SIMAP) (http://mips.gsf.de/simap) provides a database based on a pre-computed similarity matrix covering the similarity space formed by >4 million amino acid sequences from public databases and completely sequenced genomes. The database is capable of handling very large datasets and is updated incrementally. For sequence similarity searches and pairwise alignments, we implemented a grid-enabled software system, which is based on FASTA heuristics and the Smith–Waterman algorithm. Our ProtInfo system allows querying by protein sequences covered by the SIMAP dataset as well as by fragments of these sequences, highly similar sequences and title words. Each sequence in the database is supplemented with pre-calculated features generated by detailed sequence analyses. By providing WWW interfaces as well as web-services, we offer the SIMAP resource as an efficient and comprehensive tool for sequence similarity searches.
Representation of multiple sequence alignments of protein families in terms of position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) is commonly used in the detection of remote homologues. A PSSM is generated with respect to one of the sequences involved in the multiple sequence alignment as a reference. We have shown recently that the use of multiple PSSMs corresponding to an alignment, with several sequences in the family used as reference, improves the sensitivity of the remote homology detection dramatically. MulPSSM contains PSSMs for a large number of sequence and structural families of protein domains with multiple PSSMs for every family. The approach involves use of a clustering algorithm to identify most distinct sequences corresponding to a family. With each one of the distinct sequences as reference, multiple PSSMs have been generated. The current release of MulPSSM contains ∼33 000 and ∼38 000 PSSMs corresponding to 7868 sequence and 2625 structural families. A RPS_BLAST interface allows sequence search against PSSMs of sequence or structural families or both. An analysis interface allows display and convenient navigation of alignments and domain hits. MulPSSM can be accessed at http://crick.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/~mulpssm.
dbPTM is a database that compiles information on protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as the catalytic sites, solvent accessibility of amino acid residues, protein secondary and tertiary structures, protein domains and protein variations. The database includes all of the experimentally validated PTM sites from Swiss-Prot, PhosphoELM and O-GLYCBASE. Only a small fraction of Swiss-Prot proteins are annotated with experimentally verified PTM. Although the Swiss-Prot provides rich information about the PTM, other structural properties and functional information of proteins are also essential for elucidating protein mechanisms. The dbPTM systematically identifies three major types of protein PTM (phosphorylation, glycosylation and sulfation) sites against Swiss-Prot proteins by refining our previously developed prediction tool, KinasePhos (http://kinasephos.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/). Solvent accessibility and secondary structure of residues are also computationally predicted and are mapped to the PTM sites. The resource is now freely available at http://dbPTM.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.
The PUMA2 system (available at http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/puma2) is an interactive, integrated bioinformatics environment for high-throughput genetic sequence analysis and metabolic reconstructions from sequence data. PUMA2 provides a framework for comparative and evolutionary analysis of genomic data and metabolic networks in the context of taxonomic and phenotypic information. Grid infrastructure is used to perform computationally intensive tasks. PUMA2 currently contains precomputed analysis of 213 prokaryotic, 22 eukaryotic, 650 mitochondrial and 1493 viral genomes and automated metabolic reconstructions for >200 organisms. Genomic data is annotated with information integrated from >20 sequence, structural and metabolic databases and ontologies. PUMA2 supports both automated and interactive expert-driven annotation of genomes, using a variety of publicly available bioinformatics tools. It also contains a suite of unique PUMA2 tools for automated assignment of gene function, evolutionary analysis of protein families and comparative analysis of metabolic pathways. PUMA2 allows users to submit batch sequence data for automated functional analysis and construction of metabolic models. The results of these analyses are made available to the users in the PUMA2 environment for further interactive sequence analysis and annotation.
The SWISS-MODEL Repository is a database of annotated 3D protein structure models generated by the SWISS-MODEL homology-modelling pipeline. As of September 2005, the repository contained 675 000 models for 604 000 different protein sequences of the UniProt database. Regular updates ensure that the content of the repository reflects the current state of sequence and structure databases, integrating new or modified target sequences, and making use of new template structures. Each Repository entry consists of one or more 3D models accompanied by detailed information about the target protein and the model building process: functional annotation, a detailed template selection log, target-template alignment, summary of the model building and model quality assessment. The SWISS-MODEL Repository is freely accessible at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/.
TiProD is a database of human promoter sequences for which some functional features are known. It allows a user to query individual promoters and the expression pattern they mediate, gene expression signatures of individual tissues, and to retrieve sets of promoters according to their tissue-specific activity or according to individual Gene Ontology terms the corresponding genes are assigned to. We have defined a measure for tissue-specificity that allows the user to discriminate between ubiquitously and specifically expressed genes. The database is accessible at http://tiprod.cbi.pku.edu.cn:8080/index.html.
The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) is a web accessible, curated, relational database containing sequence, classification, structural, functional and evolutionary information about transport systems from a variety of living organisms. TCDB is a curated repository for factual information compiled from >10 000 references, encompassing ∼3000 representative transporters and putative transporters, classified into >400 families. The transporter classification (TC) system is an International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology approved system of nomenclature for transport protein classification. TCDB is freely accessible at http://www.tcdb.org. The web interface provides several different methods for accessing the data, including step-by-step access to hierarchical classification, direct search by sequence or TC number and full-text searching. The functional ontology that underlies the database structure facilitates powerful query searches that yield valuable data in a quick and easy way. The TCDB website also offers several tools specifically designed for analyzing the unique characteristics of transport proteins. TCDB not only provides curated information and a tool for classifying newly identified membrane proteins, but also serves as a genome transporter-annotation tool.
The University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser Database (GBD) contains sequence and annotation data for the genomes of about a dozen vertebrate species and several major model organisms. Genome annotations typically include assembly data, sequence composition, genes and gene predictions, mRNA and expressed sequence tag evidence, comparative genomics, regulation, expression and variation data. The database is optimized to support fast interactive performance with web tools that provide powerful visualization and querying capabilities for mining the data. The Genome Browser displays a wide variety of annotations at all scales from single nucleotide level up to a full chromosome. The Table Browser provides direct access to the database tables and sequence data, enabling complex queries on genome-wide datasets. The Proteome Browser graphically displays protein properties. The Gene Sorter allows filtering and comparison of genes by several metrics including expression data and several gene properties. BLAT and In Silico PCR search for sequences in entire genomes in seconds. These tools are highly integrated and provide many hyperlinks to other databases and websites. The GBD, browsing tools, downloadable data files and links to documentation and other information can be found at http://genome.ucsc.edu/.
The first release of Protein–protein Interactions Thermodynamic Database (PINT) contains >1500 data of several thermodynamic parameters along with sequence and structural information, experimental conditions and literature information. Each entry contains numerical data for the free energy change, dissociation constant, association constant, enthalpy change, heat capacity change and so on of the interacting proteins upon binding, which are important for understanding the mechanism of protein–protein interactions. PINT also includes the name and source of the proteins involved in binding, their Protein Information Resource, SWISS-PROT and Protein Data Bank (PDB) codes, secondary structure and solvent accessibility of residues at mutant positions, measuring methods, experimental conditions, such as buffers, ions and additives, and literature information. A WWW interface facilitates users to search data based on various conditions, feasibility to select the terms for output and different sorting options. Further, PINT is cross-linked with other related databases, PIR, SWISS-PROT, PDB and NCBI PUBMED literature database. The database is freely available at http://www.bioinfodatabase.com/pint/index.html
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) is a comprehensive, annotated catalogue of inherited disorders and other familial traits in animals other than humans and mice. Structured as a comparative biology resource, OMIA is a comprehensive resource of phenotypic information on heritable animal traits and genes in a strongly comparative context, relating traits to genes where possible. OMIA is modelled on and is complementary to Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). OMIA has been moved to a MySQL database at the Australian National Genomic Information Service (ANGIS) and can be accessed at http://omia.angis.org.au/. It has also been integrated into the Entrez search interface at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=omia). Curation of OMIA data by researchers working on particular species and disorders has also been enabled.
The completion of the sequencing of the human genome and the concurrent, rapid development of high-throughput proteomic methods have resulted in an increasing need for automated approaches to archive proteomic data in a repository that enables the exchange of data among researchers and also accurate integration with genomic data. PeptideAtlas (http://www.peptideatlas.org/) addresses these needs by identifying peptides by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), statistically validating those identifications and then mapping identified sequences to the genomes of eukaryotic organisms. A meaningful comparison of data across different experiments generated by different groups using different types of instruments is enabled by the implementation of a uniform analytic process. This uniform statistical validation ensures a consistent and high-quality set of peptide and protein identifications. The raw data from many diverse proteomic experiments are made available in the associated PeptideAtlas repository in several formats. Here we present a summary of our process and details about the Human, Drosophila and Yeast PeptideAtlas builds.
The Protein Model Database (PMDB) is a public resource aimed at storing manually built 3D models of proteins. The database is designed to provide access to models published in the scientific literature, together with validating experimental data. It is a relational database and it currently contains >74 000 models for ∼240 proteins. The system is accessible at http://www.caspur.it/PMDB and allows predictors to submit models along with related supporting evidence and users to download them through a simple and intuitive interface. Users can navigate in the database and retrieve models referring to the same target protein or to different regions of the same protein. Each model is assigned a unique identifier that allows interested users to directly access the data.
Operon structures play an important role in co-regulation in prokaryotes. Although over 200 complete genome sequences are now available, databases providing genome-wide operon information have been limited to certain specific genomes. Thus, we have developed an ODB (Operon DataBase), which provides a data retrieval system of known operons among the many complete genomes. Additionally, putative operons that are conserved in terms of known operons are also provided. The current version of our database contains about 2000 known operon information in more than 50 genomes and about 13 000 putative operons in more than 200 genomes. This system integrates four types of associations: genome context, gene co-expression obtained from microarray data, functional links in biological pathways and the conservation of gene order across the genomes. These associations are indicators of the genes that organize an operon, and the combination of these indicators allows us to predict more reliable operons. Furthermore, our system validates these predictions using known operon information obtained from the literature. This database integrates known literature-based information and genomic data. In addition, it provides an operon prediction tool, which make the system useful for both bioinformatics researchers and experimental biologists. Our database is accessible at http://odb.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp/.
Realization of conserved residues that represent a protein family is crucial for clearer understanding of biological function as well as for the better recognition of additional members in sequence databases. Functionally important residues are recognized well due to their high degree of conservation in closely related sequences and are annotated in functional motif databases. Structural motifs are central to the integrity of the fold and require careful analysis for their identification. We report the availability of a database of spatially interacting motifs in single protein structures as well as those among distantly related protein structures that belong to a superfamily. Spatial interactions amongst conserved motifs are automatically measured using sequence similarity scores and distance calculations. Interactions between pairs of conserved motifs are described in the form of pseudoenergies. iMOTdb database provides information for 854 488 motifs corresponding to 60 849 protein structural domains and 22 648 protein structural entries.
Unrecognized frameshifts, in-frame stop codons and sequencing errors lead to Interrupted CoDing Sequence (ICDS) that can seriously affect all subsequent steps of functional characterization, from in silico analysis to high-throughput proteomic projects. Here, we describe the Interrupted CoDing Sequence database containing ICDS detected by a similarity-based approach in 80 complete prokaryotic genomes. ICDS can be retrieved by species browsing or similarity searches via a web interface (http://www-bio3d-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/ICDS/). The definition of each interrupted gene is provided as well as the ICDS genomic localization with the surrounding sequence. Furthermore, to facilitate the experimental characterization of ICDS, we propose optimized primers for re-sequencing purposes. The database will be regularly updated with additional data from ongoing sequenced genomes. Our strategy has been validated by three independent tests: (i) ICDS prediction on a benchmark of artificially created frameshifts, (ii) comparison of predicted ICDS and results obtained from the comparison of the two genomic sequences of Bacillus licheniformis strain ATCC 14580 and (iii) re-sequencing of 25 predicted ICDS of the recently sequenced genome of Mycobacterium smegmatis. This allows us to estimate the specificity and sensitivity (95 and 82%, respectively) of our program and the efficiency of primer determination.
SCOPPI, the structural classification of protein–protein interfaces, is a comprehensive database that classifies and annotates domain interactions derived from all known protein structures. SCOPPI applies SCOP domain definitions and a distance criterion to determine inter-domain interfaces. Using a novel method based on multiple sequence and structural alignments of SCOP families, SCOPPI presents a comprehensive geometrical classification of domain interfaces. Various interface characteristics such as number, type and position of interacting amino acids, conservation, interface size, and permanent or transient nature of the interaction are further provided. Proteins in SCOPPI are annotated with Gene Ontology terms, and the ontology can be used to quickly browse SCOPPI. Screenshots are available for every interface and its participating domains. Here, we describe contents and features of the web-based user interface as well as the underlying methods used to generate SCOPPI's data. In addition, we present a number of examples where SCOPPI becomes a useful tool to analyze viral mimicry of human interface binding sites, gene fusion events, conservation of interface residues and diversity of interface localizations. SCOPPI is available at http://www.scoppi.org.
The Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/) project provides a comprehensive and integrated source of annotation of large genome sequences. Over the last year the number of genomes available from the Ensembl site has increased from 4 to 19, with the addition of the mammalian genomes of Rhesus macaque and Opossum, the chordate genome of Ciona intestinalis and the import and integration of the yeast genome. The year has also seen extensive improvements to both data analysis and presentation, with the introduction of a redesigned website, the addition of RNA gene and regulatory annotation and substantial improvements to the integration of human genome variation data.
As the University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (UM-BBD, http://umbbd.ahc.umn.edu/) starts its second decade, it includes information on over 900 compounds, over 600 enzymes, nearly 1000 reactions and about 350 microorganism entries. Its Biochemical Periodic Tables have grown to include biological information for almost all stable, non-noble-gas elements (http://umbbd.ahc.umn.edu/periodic/). Its Pathway Prediction System (PPS) (http://umbbd.ahc.umn.edu/predict/) is now an internationally recognized, open system for predicting microbial catabolism of organic compounds. Graphical display of PPS rules, a stand-alone version of the PPS and guidance for PPS users are being developed. The next decade should see the PPS, and the UM-BBD on which it is based, find increasing use by national and international government agencies, commercial organizations and educational institutions.
ASAP is a comprehensive web-based system for community genome annotation and analysis. ASAP is being used for a large-scale effort to augment and curate annotations for genomes of enterobacterial pathogens and for additional genome sequences. New tools, such as the genome alignment program Mauve, have been incorporated into ASAP in order to improve display and analysis of related genomes. Recent improvements to the database and challenges for future development of the system are discussed. ASAP is available on the web at https://asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/asap/logon.php.
The Gene Ontology (GO) project (http://www.geneontology.org) develops and uses a set of structured, controlled vocabularies for community use in annotating genes, gene products and sequences (also see http://song.sourceforge.net/). The GO Consortium continues to improve to the vocabulary content, reflecting the impact of several novel mechanisms of incorporating community input. A growing number of model organism databases and genome annotation groups contribute annotation sets using GO terms to GO's public repository. Updates to the AmiGO browser have improved access to contributed genome annotations. As the GO project continues to grow, the use of the GO vocabularies is becoming more varied as well as more widespread. The GO project provides an ontological annotation system that enables biologists to infer knowledge from large amounts of data.
The Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS at the GSF), Neuherberg, Germany, provides resources related to genome information. Manually curated databases for several reference organisms are maintained. Several of these databases are described elsewhere in this and other recent NAR database issues. In a complementary effort, a comprehensive set of >400 genomes automatically annotated with the PEDANT system are maintained. The main goal of our current work on creating and maintaining genome databases is to extend gene centered information to information on interactions within a generic comprehensive framework. We have concentrated our efforts along three lines (i) the development of suitable comprehensive data structures and database technology, communication and query tools to include a wide range of different types of information enabling the representation of complex information such as functional modules or networks Genome Research Environment System, (ii) the development of databases covering computable information such as the basic evolutionary relations among all genes, namely SIMAP, the sequence similarity matrix and the CABiNet network analysis framework and (iii) the compilation and manual annotation of information related to interactions such as protein–protein interactions or other types of relations (e.g. MPCDB, MPPI, CYGD). All databases described and the detailed descriptions of our projects can be accessed through the MIPS WWW server (http://mips.gsf.de).
Access to unified datasets of protein and genetic interactions is critical for interrogation of gene/protein function and analysis of global network properties. BioGRID is a freely accessible database of physical and genetic interactions available at http://www.thebiogrid.org. BioGRID release version 2.0 includes >116 000 interactions from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens. Over 30 000 interactions have recently been added from 5778 sources through exhaustive curation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae primary literature. An internally hyper-linked web interface allows for rapid search and retrieval of interaction data. Full or user-defined datasets are freely downloadable as tab-delimited text files and PSI-MI XML. Pre-computed graphical layouts of interactions are available in a variety of file formats. User-customized graphs with embedded protein, gene and interaction attributes can be constructed with a visualization system called Osprey that is dynamically linked to the BioGRID.
TcruziDB (http://TcruziDB.org) is an integrated post-genomics database for the parasitic organism, Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease. TcruziDB was established in 2003 as a flat-file database with tools for mining the unannotated sequence reads and preliminary contig assemblies emerging from the Tri-Tryp genome consortium (TIGR/SBRI/Karolinska). Today, TcruziDB houses the recently published assembled genomic contigs and annotation provided by the genome consortium in a relational database supported by the Genomics Unified Schema (GUS) architecture. The combination of an annotated genome and a relational architecture has facilitated the integration of genomic data with expression data (proteomic and EST) and permitted the construction of automated analysis pipelines. TcruziDB has accepted, and will continue to accept the deposition of genomic and functional genomic datasets contributed by the research community.
Pfam is a database of protein families that currently contains 7973 entries (release 18.0). A recent development in Pfam has enabled the grouping of related families into clans. Pfam clans are described in detail, together with the new associated web pages. Improvements to the range of Pfam web tools and the first set of Pfam web services that allow programmatic access to the database and associated tools are also presented. Pfam is available on the web in the UK (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/), the USA (http://pfam.wustl.edu/), France (http://pfam.jouy.inra.fr/) and Sweden (http://pfam.cgb.ki.se/).
StellaBase, the Nematostella vectensis Genomics Database, is a web-based resource that will facilitate desktop and bench-top studies of the starlet sea anemone. Nematostella is an emerging model organism that has already proven useful for addressing fundamental questions in developmental evolution and evolutionary genomics. StellaBase allows users to query the assembled Nematostella genome, a confirmed gene library, and a predicted genome using both keyword and homology based search functions. Data provided by these searches will elucidate gene family evolution in early animals. Unique research tools, including a Nematostella genetic stock library, a primer library, a literature repository and a gene expression library will provide support to the burgeoning Nematostella research community. The development of StellaBase accompanies significant upgrades to CnidBase, the Cnidarian Evolutionary Genomics Database. With the completion of the first sequenced cnidarian genome, genome comparison tools have been added to CnidBase. In addition, StellaBase provides a framework for the integration of additional species-specific databases into CnidBase. StellaBase is available at http://www.stellabase.org.
The organelle genome database GOBASE is now in its twelfth release, and includes 350 000 mitochondrial sequences and 118 000 chloroplast sequences, roughly a 3-fold expansion since previously documented. GOBASE also includes a fully reannotated genome sequence of Rickettsia prowazekii, one of the closest bacterial relatives of mitochondria, and will shortly expand to contain more data from bacteria from which organelles originated. All these sequences are now accessible through a single unified interface. Enhancements to the functionality of GOBASE include addition of pages for RNA structures and a page compiling data about the taxonomic distribution of organelle-encoded genes; incorporation of Gene Ontology terms; addition of features deduced from incomplete annotations to sequences in GenBank; marking of type examples in cases where single genes in single species are oversampled within GenBank; and addition of graphics illustrating gene structure and the position of neighbouring genes on a sequence. The database has been reimplemented in PostgreSQL to facilitate development and maintenance, and structural modifications have been made to speed up queries, particularly those related to taxonomy. The GOBASE database can be queried at http://gobase.bcm.umontreal.ca/ and inquiries should be directed to gobase@bch.umontreal.ca.
Although tremendous effort has been put into synthetic libraries, most drugs on the market are still natural compounds or derivatives thereof. There are encyclopaedias of natural compounds, but the availability of these compounds is often unclear and catalogues from numerous suppliers have to be checked. To overcome these problems we have compiled a database of ∼50 000 natural compounds from different suppliers. To enable efficient identification of the desired compounds, we have implemented substructure searches with typical templates. Starting points for in silico screenings are about 2500 well-known and classified natural compounds from a compendium that we have added. Possible medical applications can be ascertained via automatic searches for similar drugs in a free conformational drug database containing WHO indications. Furthermore, we have computed about three million conformers, which are deployed to account for the flexibilities of the compounds when the 3D superposition algorithm that we have developed is used. The SuperNatural Database is publicly available at http://bioinformatics.charite.de/supernatural. Viewing requires the free Chime-plugin from MDL (Chime) or Java2 Runtime Environment (MView), which is also necessary for using Marvin application for chemical drawing.
MPSS (massively parallel signature sequencing) is a sequencing-based technology that uses a unique method to quantify gene expression level, generating millions of short sequence tags per library. We have created a series of databases for four species (Arabidopsis, rice, grape and Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus). Our MPSS databases measure the expression level of most genes under defined conditions and provide information about potentially novel transcripts (antisense transcripts, alternative splice isoforms and regulatory intergenic transcripts). A modified version of MPSS has been used to perform deep profiling of small RNAs from Arabidopsis, and we have recently adapted our database to display these data. Interpretation of the small RNA MPSS data is facilitated by the inclusion of extensive repeat data in our genome viewer. All the data and the tools introduced in this article are available at http://mpss.udel.edu.
Protein structures are flexible, changing their shapes not only upon substrate binding, but also during evolution as a collective effect of mutations, deletions and insertions. A new generation of protein structure comparison algorithms allows for such flexibility; they go beyond identifying the largest common part between two proteins and find hinge regions and patterns of flexibility in protein families. Here we present a Flexible Structural Neighborhood (FSN), a database of structural neighbors of proteins deposited in PDB as seen by a flexible protein structure alignment program FATCAT, developed previously in our group. The database, searchable by a protein PDB code, provides lists of proteins with statistically significant structural similarity and on lower menu levels provides detailed alignments, interactive superposition of structures and positions of hinges that were identified in the comparison. While superficially similar to other structural protein alignment resources, FSN provides a unique resource to study not only protein structural similarity, but also how protein structures change. FSN is available from a server http://fatcat.burnham.org/fatcat/struct_neighbor and by direct links from the PDB database.
WormBase (http://wormbase.org), the public database for genomics and biology of Caenorhabditis elegans, has been restructured for stronger performance and expanded for richer biological content. Performance was improved by accelerating the loading of central data pages such as the omnibus Gene page, by rationalizing internal data structures and software for greater portability, and by making the Genome Browser highly customizable in how it views and exports genomic subsequences. Arbitrarily complex, user-specified queries are now possible through Textpresso (for all available literature) and through WormMart (for most genomic data). Biological content was enriched by reconciling all available cDNA and expressed sequence tag data with gene predictions, clarifying single nucleotide polymorphism and RNAi sites, and summarizing known functions for most genes studied in this organism.
The SGCEdb (http://sgce.cbse.uab.edu) database/interface serves the primary purpose of reporting progress of the Structural Genomics of Caenorhabditis elegans project at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. It stores and analyzes results of experiments ranging from solubility screening arrays to individual protein purification and structure solution. External databases and algorithms are referenced and evaluated for target selection in the human, C.elegans and Pneumocystis carinii genomes. The flexible and reusable design permits tracking of standard and custom experiment types in a scientist-defined sequence. The database coordinates efforts between collaborators and is adaptable to a wide range of biological applications.
The Yeast Gene Order Browser (YGOB) is an online tool designed to facilitate the comparative genomic visualization and appraisal of synteny within and between the genomes of seven hemiascomycete yeast species. Three of these genomes are polyploid, and hence contain intra-genomic syntenic regions, the correct assembly of which is a particular success of YGOB. Designed to accurately assemble, display and score gene order relationships, YGOB is both an interactive tool for browsing genomic data, and a software engine now being used for evolutionary analyses on a whole-genome scale. Underlying the online interface is the YGOB database, which consists of homology assignments across the species, extensively curated based on sequence similarity and novelly, an appraisal of genomic context (synteny) in multiple genomes. Currently the YGOB database incorporates genome data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida glabrata, Saccharomyces castellii, Ashbya gossypii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces waltii and Saccharomyces kluyveri, but the system is scaleable to accommodate additional genomes. This paper discusses the usage and utility of version 1.0 of YGOB, which is publicly available at http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/ygob.
Ligand-gated ion channels form transmembrane ionic pores controlled by the binding of chemicals. The LGICdb aims to be a non-redundant, manually curated resource offering access to the large number of subunits composing extracellularly activated ligand-gated ion channels, such as nicotinic, ATP, GABA and glutamate ionotropic receptors. Composed of more than 500 human curated entries, the XML native database has been relocated in 2004 to the EBI. Its facilities have been enhanced with a new search system, customized multiple sequence alignments and manipulation of protein structures (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/LGICdb/). Despite the vast improvement of general sequence resources, the LGICdb still provide sequences unavailable elsewhere.
Biological entities are strongly related and mutually dependent on each other. Therefore, there is a growing need to corroborate and integrate data from different resources and aspects of biological systems in order to analyze them effectively. Biozon is a unified biological database that integrates heterogeneous data types such as proteins, structures, domain families, protein–protein interactions and cellular pathways, and establishes the relationships between them. All data are integrated on to a single graph schema centered around the non-redundant set of biological objects that are shared by each source. This integration results in a highly connected graph structure that provides a more complete picture of the known context of a given object that cannot be determined from any one source. Currently, Biozon integrates roughly 2 million protein sequences, 42 million DNA or RNA sequences, 32 000 protein structures, 150 000 interactions and more from sources such as GenBank, UniProt, Protein Data Bank (PDB) and BIND. Biozon augments source data with locally derived data such as 5 billion pairwise protein alignments and 8 million structural alignments. The user may form complex cross-type queries on the graph structure, add similarity relations to form fuzzy queries and rank the results based on analysis of the edge structure similar to Google PageRank, online at Biozon.org.
The Genomes On Line Database (GOLD) is a web resource for comprehensive access to information regarding complete and ongoing genome sequencing projects worldwide. The database currently incorporates information on over 1500 sequencing projects, of which 294 have been completed and the data deposited in the public databases. GOLD v.2 has been expanded to provide information related to organism properties such as phenotype, ecotype and disease. Furthermore, project relevance and availability information is now included. GOLD is available at http://www.genomesonline.org. It is also mirrored at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Crete, Greece at http://gold.imbb.forth.gr/
The Gene3D release 4 database and web portal (http://cathwww.biochem.ucl.ac.uk:8080/Gene3D) provide a combined structural, functional and evolutionary view of the protein world. It is focussed on providing structural annotation for protein sequences without structural representatives—including the complete proteome sets of over 240 different species. The protein sequences have also been clustered into whole-chain families so as to aid functional prediction. The structural annotation is generated using HMM models based on the CATH domain families; CATH is a repository for manually deduced protein domains. Amongst the changes from the last publication are: the addition of over 100 genomes and the UniProt sequence database, domain data from Pfam, metabolic pathway and functional data from COGs, KEGG and GO, and protein–protein interaction data from MINT and BIND. The website has been rebuilt to allow more sophisticated querying and the data returned is presented in a clearer format with greater functionality. Furthermore, all data can be downloaded in a simple XML format, allowing users to carry out complex investigations at their own computers.
The miRBase database aims to provide integrated interfaces to comprehensive microRNA sequence data, annotation and predicted gene targets. miRBase takes over functionality from the microRNA Registry and fulfils three main roles: the miRBase Registry acts as an independent arbiter of microRNA gene nomenclature, assigning names prior to publication of novel miRNA sequences. miRBase Sequences is the primary online repository for miRNA sequence data and annotation. miRBase Targets is a comprehensive new database of predicted miRNA target genes. miRBase is available at http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/.
With the completion of the rice genome sequencing, a standardized annotation is necessary so that the information from the genome sequence can be fully utilized in understanding the biology of rice and other cereal crops. An annotation jamboree was held in Japan with the aim of annotating and manually curating all the genes in the rice genome. Here we present the Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB), which has been developed to provide access to the annotation data. The RAP-DB has two different types of annotation viewers, BLAST and BLAT search, and other useful features. By connecting the annotations to other rice genomics data, such as full-length cDNAs and Tos17 mutant lines, the RAP-DB serves as a hub for rice genomics. All of the resources can be accessed through http://rapdb.lab.nig.ac.jp/.
Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been the most actively employed targets in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of human carcinoma, such as PSA in the diagnosis of prostate cancer and NY-ESO-1 in the immunotherapy of melanoma and other cancers. However, identification of TAAs has often been hampered by the complicated and laborsome laboratory procedures. In order to accelerate the process of tumor antigen discovery, and thereby improve diagnosis and treatment of human carcinoma, we have made an effort to establish a publicly available Human Potential Tumor Associated Antigen database (HPtaa) with potential TAAs identified by in silico computing (http://www.hptaa.org). Tumor specificity was chosen as the core of tumor antigen evaluation, together with other relevant clues. Various platforms of gene expression, including microarray, expressed sequence tag and SAGE data, were processed and integrated by several penalty algorithms. A total of 3518 potential TAAs have been included in the database, which is freely available to academic users. As far as we know, this database is the first one addressing human potential TAAs, and the first one integrating various kinds of expression platforms for one purpose.
MetaCyc is a database of metabolic pathways and enzymes located at http://MetaCyc.org/. Its goal is to serve as a metabolic encyclopedia, containing a collection of non-redundant pathways central to small molecule metabolism, which have been reported in the experimental literature. Most of the pathways in MetaCyc occur in microorganisms and plants, although animal pathways are also represented. MetaCyc contains metabolic pathways, enzymatic reactions, enzymes, chemical compounds, genes and review-level comments. Enzyme information includes substrate specificity, kinetic properties, activators, inhibitors, cofactor requirements and links to sequence and structure databases. Data are curated from the primary literature by curators with expertise in biochemistry and molecular biology. MetaCyc serves as a readily accessible comprehensive resource on microbial and plant pathways for genome analysis, basic research, education, metabolic engineering and systems biology. Querying, visualization and curation of the database is supported by SRI's Pathway Tools software. The PathoLogic component of Pathway Tools is used in conjunction with MetaCyc to predict the metabolic network of an organism from its annotated genome. SRI and the European Bioinformatics Institute employed this tool to create pathway/genome databases (PGDBs) for 165 organisms, available at the BioCyc.org website. These PGDBs also include predicted operons and pathway hole fillers.
Alternative splicing is an important regulatory mechanism of mammalian gene expression. The alternative splicing database (ASD) consortium is systematically collecting and annotating data on alternative splicing. We present the continuation and upgrade of the ASD [T. A. Thanaraj, S. Stamm, F. Clark, J. J. Riethoven, V. Le Texier, J. Muilu (2004) Nucleic Acids Res. 32, D64–D69] that consists of computationally and manually generated data. Its largest parts are AltSplice, a value-added database of computationally delineated alternative splicing events. Its data include alternatively spliced introns/exons, events, isoform splicing patterns and isoform peptide sequences. AltSplice data are generated by examining gene-transcript alignments. The data are annotated for various biological features including splicing signals, expression states, (SNP)-mediated splicing and cross-species conservation. AEdb forms the manually curated component of ASD. It is a literature-based data set containing sequence and properties of alternatively spliced exons, functional enumeration of observed splicing events, characterization of observed splicing regulatory elements, and a collection of experimentally clarified minigene constructs. ASD includes a workbench, which is an analysis tool that enables users to carry out splicing related analysis such as characterization of introns for various splicing signals, identification of splicing regulatory elements on a given RNA sequence, prediction of putative exons and prediction of putative translation start codons. The different ASD modules are integrated and can be accessed through user-friendly interfaces and visualization tools. ASD data has been integrated with Ensembl genome annotation project as a Distributed Annotation System (DAS) resource and can be viewed on Ensembl genome browser. The ASD resource is presented at (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/asd).
The OrthoMCL database (http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu) houses ortholog group predictions for 55 species, including 16 bacterial and 4 archaeal genomes representing phylogenetically diverse lineages, and most currently available complete eukaryotic genomes: 24 unikonts (12 animals, 9 fungi, microsporidium, Dictyostelium, Entamoeba), 4 plants/algae and 7 apicomplexan parasites. OrthoMCL software was used to cluster proteins based on sequence similarity, using an all-against-all BLAST search of each species' proteome, followed by normalization of inter-species differences, and Markov clustering. A total of 511 797 proteins (81.6% of the total dataset) were clustered into 70 388 ortholog groups. The ortholog database may be queried based on protein or group accession numbers, keyword descriptions or BLAST similarity. Ortholog groups exhibiting specific phyletic patterns may also be identified, using either a graphical interface or a text-based Phyletic Pattern Expression grammar. Information for ortholog groups includes the phyletic profile, the list of member proteins and a multiple sequence alignment, a statistical summary and graphical view of similarities, and a graphical representation of domain architecture. OrthoMCL software, the entire FASTA dataset employed and clustering results are available for download. OrthoMCL-DB provides a centralized warehouse for orthology prediction among multiple species, and will be updated and expanded as additional genome sequence data become available.
Peptidases (proteolytic enzymes) and their natural, protein inhibitors are of great relevance to biology, medicine and biotechnology. The MEROPS database (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk) aims to fulfil the need for an integrated source of information about these proteins. The organizational principle of the database is a hierarchical classification in which homologous sets of proteins of interest are grouped into families and the homologous families are grouped in clans. The most important addition to the database has been newly written, concise text annotations for each peptidase family. Other forms of information recently added include highlighting of active site residues (or the replacements that render some homologues inactive) in the sequence displays and BlastP search results, dynamically generated alignments and trees at the peptidase or inhibitor level, and a curated list of human and mouse homologues that have been experimentally characterized as active. A new way to display information at taxonomic levels higher than species has been devised. In the Literature pages, references have been flagged to draw attention to particularly ‘hot’ topics.
Proteome science relies on bioinformatics tools to characterize proteins via their proteolytic peptides which are identified via characteristic mass spectra generated after their ions undergo fragmentation in the gas phase within the mass spectrometer. The resulting secondary ion mass spectra are compared with protein sequence databases in order to identify the amino acid sequence. Although these search tools (e.g. SEQUEST, Mascot, X!Tandem, Phenyx) are frequently successful, much is still not understood about the amino acid sequence patterns which promote/protect particular fragmentation pathways, and hence lead to the presence/absence of particular ions from different ion series. In order to advance this area, we have developed a database, PepSeeker (http://nwsr.smith.man.ac.uk/pepseeker), which captures this peptide identification and ion information from proteome experiments. The database currently contains >185 000 peptides and associated database search information. Users may query this resource to retrieve peptide, protein and spectral information based on protein or peptide information, including the amino acid sequence itself represented by regular expressions coupled with ion series information. We believe this database will be useful to proteome researchers wishing to understand gas phase peptide ion chemistry in order to improve peptide identification strategies. Questions can be addressed to j.selley@manchester.ac.uk.
Recent work has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in critical biological processes by suppressing the translation of coding genes. This work develops an integrated database, miRNAMap, to store the known miRNA genes, the putative miRNA genes, the known miRNA targets and the putative miRNA targets. The known miRNA genes in four mammalian genomes such as human, mouse, rat and dog are obtained from miRBase, and experimentally validated miRNA targets are identified in a survey of the literature. Putative miRNA precursors were identified by RNAz, which is a non-coding RNA prediction tool based on comparative sequence analysis. The mature miRNA of the putative miRNA genes is accurately determined using a machine learning approach, mmiRNA. Then, miRanda was applied to predict the miRNA targets within the conserved regions in 3′-UTR of the genes in the four mammalian genomes. The miRNAMap also provides the expression profiles of the known miRNAs, cross-species comparisons, gene annotations and cross-links to other biological databases. Both textual and graphical web interface are provided to facilitate the retrieval of data from the miRNAMap. The database is freely available at http://mirnamap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.
Marine microbial genomics and metagenomics is an emerging field in environmental research. Since the completion of the first marine bacterial genome in 2003, the number of fully sequenced marine bacteria has grown rapidly. Concurrently, marine metagenomics studies are performed on a regular basis, and the resulting number of sequences is growing exponentially. To address environmentally relevant questions like organismal adaptations to oceanic provinces and regional differences in the microbial cycling of nutrients, it is necessary to couple sequence data with geographical information and supplement them with contextual information like physical, chemical and biological data. Therefore, new specialized databases are needed to organize and standardize data storage as well as centralize data access and interpretation. We introduce Megx.net, a set of databases and tools that handle genomic and metagenomic sequences in their environmental contexts. Megx.net includes (i) a geographic information system to systematically store and analyse marine genomic and metagenomic data in conjunction with contextual information; (ii) an environmental genome browser with fast search functionalities; (iii) a database with precomputed analyses for selected complete genomes; and (iv) a database and tool to classify metagenomic fragments based on oligonucleotide signatures. These integrative databases and webserver will help researchers to generate a better understanding of the functioning of marine ecosystems. All resources are freely accessible at http://www.megx.net.
The NAR Molecular Biology Database Collection is a public online resource that contains links to all databases described in this issue of Nucleic Acids Research. In addition, this collection lists databases that have been featured in previous issues of NAR, as well as selected other databases that are freely available to the public and may be useful to the molecular biologist. The 2006 update includes 858 databases, 139 more than the previous one. The databases come with brief summaries, many of which have been updated recently. Each database is assigned a stable accession number that does not change if the database moves to a new location and its URL, authors' names or the contact person address are updated. The complete database list and summaries are available online at the Nucleic Acids Research website http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/.
Identifying genes that underlie quantitative trait loci (QTL) is a challenging task. Here, we present a new QTL software system, named QTL MatchMaker. The system is designed to integrate and mine QTL information across human, mouse and rat genomes and to annotate functional genomic data. It combines and organizes information from relevant public databases and publications and integrates QTL, physical, genetic and cytogenetic maps across human, mouse and rat. To make this application available to the research community we have developed a website for high-throughput mapping of expressed sequences to QTL and for selection of candidate genes in the physiological genomics context of complex traits. QTL MatchMaker is accessible at http://pmrc.med.mssm.edu:9090/QTL/jsp/qtlhome.jsp
The Phytophthora Functional Genomics Database (PFGD; http://www.pfgd.org), developed by the National Center for Genome Resources in collaboration with The Ohio State University-Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OSU-OARDC), is a publicly accessible information resource for Phytophthora–plant interaction research. PFGD contains transcript, genomic, gene expression and functional assay data for Phytophthora infestans, which causes late blight of potato, and Phytophthora sojae, which affects soybeans. Automated analyses are performed on all sequence data, including consensus sequences derived from clustered and assembled expressed sequence tags. The PFGD search filter interface allows intuitive navigation of transcript and genomic data organized by library and derived queries using modifiers, annotation keywords or sequence names. BLAST services are provided for libraries built from the transcript and genomic sequences. Transcript data visualization tools include Quality Screening, Multiple Sequence Alignment and Features and Annotations viewers. A genomic browser that supports comparative analysis via novel dynamic functional annotation comparisons is also provided. PFGD is integrated with the Solanaceae Genomics Database (SolGD; http://www.solgd.org) to help provide insight into the mechanisms of infection and resistance, specifically as they relate to the genus Phytophthora pathogens and their plant hosts.
In addition to maintaining the GenBank(R) nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides analysis and retrieval resources for the data in GenBank and other biological data made available through NCBI's Web site. NCBI resources include Entrez, the Entrez Programming Utilities, MyNCBI, PubMed, PubMed Central, Entrez Gene, the NCBI Taxonomy Browser, BLAST, BLAST Link (BLink), Electronic PCR, OrfFinder, Spidey, Splign, RefSeq, UniGene, HomoloGene, ProtEST, dbMHC, dbSNP, Cancer Chromosomes, Entrez Genomes and related tools, the Map Viewer, Model Maker, Evidence Viewer, Clusters of Orthologous Groups, Retroviral Genotyping Tools, HIV-1, Human Protein Interaction Database, SAGEmap, Gene Expression Omnibus, Entrez Probe, GENSAT, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals, the Molecular Modeling Database, the Conserved Domain Database, the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool and the PubChem suite of small molecule databases. Augmenting many of the Web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized datasets. All of the resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) integrates genetic and genomic data for the mouse in order to facilitate the use of the mouse as a model system for understanding human biology and disease processes. A core component of the MGD effort is the acquisition and integration of genomic, genetic, functional and phenotypic information about mouse genes and gene products. MGD works within the broader bioinformatics community to define referential and semantic standards to facilitate data exchange between resources including the incorporation of information from the biomedical literature. MGD is also a platform for computational assessment of integrated biological data with the goal of identifying candidate genes associated with complex phenotypes. MGD is web accessible at http://www.informatics.jax.org. Recent improvements in MGD described here include the incorporation of an interactive genome browser, the enhancement of phenotype resources and the further development of functional annotation resources.
LIFEdb (http://www.LIFEdb.de) integrates data from large-scale functional genomics assays and manual cDNA annotation with bioinformatics gene expression and protein analysis. New features of LIFEdb include (i) an updated user interface with enhanced query capabilities, (ii) a configurable output table and the option to download search results in XML, (iii) the integration of data from cell-based screening assays addressing the influence of protein-overexpression on cell proliferation and (iv) the display of the relative expression (‘Electronic Northern’) of the genes under investigation using curated gene expression ontology information. LIFEdb enables researchers to systematically select and characterize genes and proteins of interest, and presents data and information via its user-friendly web-based interface.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a recently discovered class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate expression of target genes either by decreasing the stability of the target mRNA or by translational inhibition. They are involved in diverse processes, including cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Recent evidence also suggests their importance for cancerogenesis. By far the most important model systems in cancer research are mammalian organisms. Thus, we decided to compile comprehensive information on mammalian miRNAs, their origin and regulated target genes in an exhaustive, curated database called Argonaute (http://www.ma.uni-heidelberg.de/apps/zmf/argonaute/interface). Argonaute collects latest information from both literature and other databases. In contrast to current databases on miRNAs like miRBase::Sequences, NONCODE or RNAdb, Argonaute hosts additional information on the origin of an miRNA, i.e. in which host gene it is encoded, its expression in different tissues and its known or proposed function, its potential target genes including Gene Ontology annotation, as well as miRNA families and proteins known to be involved in miRNA processing. Additionally, target genes are linked to an information retrieval system that provides comprehensive information from sequence databases and a simultaneous search of MEDLINE with all synonyms of a given gene. The web interface allows the user to get information for a single or multiple miRNAs, either selected or uploaded through a text file. Argonaute currently has information on 839 miRNAs from human, mouse and rat.
Prokaryotic genomic DNA is generally negatively supercoiled in vivo. Many regulatory processes, including the initiation of transcription, are known to depend on the superhelical state of the DNA substrate. The stresses induced within DNA by negative superhelicity can destabilize the DNA duplex at specific sites. Various experiments have either shown or suggested that stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) is involved in specific regulatory mechanisms governing a variety of biological processes. We have developed methods to evaluate the SIDD properties of DNA sequences, including complete chromosomes. This analysis predicts the locations where the duplex becomes destabilized under superhelical stress. Previous studies have shown that the SIDD-susceptible sites predicted in this way occur at rates much higher than expected at random in transcriptional regulatory regions, and much lower than expected in coding regions. Analysis of the SIDD profiles of 42 bacterial genomes chosen for their diversity confirms this pattern. Predictions of SIDD sites have been used to identify potential genomic regulatory regions, and suggest both possible regulatory mechanisms involving stress-induced destabilization and experimental tests of these mechanisms. Here we describe the SIDDBASE database which enables users to retrieve and visualize the results of SIDD analyses of completely sequenced prokaryotic and archaeal genomes, together with their annotations. SIDDBASE is available at www.gc.ucdavis.edu/benham/siddbase.
Maintained at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler, Texas, the tmRNA database (tmRDB) is accessible at the URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/tmRDB/tmRDB.html with mirror sites located at Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama (http://www.ag.auburn.edu/mirror/tmRDB/) and the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Denmark (http://tmrdb.kvl.dk/). The signal recognition particle database (SRPDB) at http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html is mirrored at http://srpdb.kvl.dk/ and the University of Goteborg (http://bio.lundberg.gu.se/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html). The databases assist in investigations of the tmRNP (a ribonucleoprotein complex which liberates stalled bacterial ribosomes) and the SRP (a particle which recognizes signal sequences and directs secretory proteins to cell membranes). The curated tmRNA and SRP RNA alignments consider base pairs supported by comparative sequence analysis. Also shown are alignments of the tmRNA-associated proteins SmpB, ribosomal protein S1, alanyl-tRNA synthetase and Elongation Factor Tu, as well as the SRP proteins SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP21, SRP54 (Ffh), SRP68, SRP72, cpSRP43, Flhf, SRP receptor (alpha) and SRP receptor (beta). All alignments can be easily examined using a new exploratory browser. The databases provide links to high-resolution structures and serve as depositories for structures obtained by molecular modeling.
Rice, maize, sorghum, wheat, barley and the other major crop grasses from the family Poaceae (Gramineae) are mankind's most important source of calories and contribute tens of billions of dollars annually to the world economy (FAO 1999, http://www.fao.org; USDA 1997, http://www.usda.gov). Continued improvement of Poaceae crops is necessary in order to continue to feed an ever-growing world population. However, of the major crop grasses, only rice (Oryza sativa), with a compact genome of ∼400 Mbp, has been sequenced and annotated. The Gramene database (http://www.gramene.org) takes advantage of the known genetic colinearity (synteny) between rice and the major crop plant genomes to provide maize, sorghum, millet, wheat, oat and barley researchers with the benefits of an annotated genome years before their own species are sequenced. Gramene is a one stop portal for finding curated literature, genetic and genomic datasets related to maps, markers, genes, genomes and quantitative trait loci. The addition of several new tools to Gramene has greatly facilitated the potential for comparative analysis among the grasses and contributes to our understanding of the anatomy, development, environmental responses and the factors influencing agronomic performance of cereal crops. Since the last publication on Gramene database by D. H. Ware, P. Jaiswal, J. Ni, I. V. Yap, X. Pan, K. Y. Clark, L. Teytelman, S. C. Schmidt, W. Zhao, K. Chang et al. [(2002), Plant Physiol., 130, 1606–1613], the database has undergone extensive changes that are described in this publication.
The database of molecular motions, MolMovDB (http://molmovdb.org), has been in existence for the past decade. It classifies macromolecular motions and provides tools to interpolate between two conformations (the Morph Server) and predict possible motions in a single structure. In 2005, we expanded the services offered on MolMovDB. In particular, we further developed the Morph Server to produce improved interpolations between two submitted structures. We added support for multiple chains to the original adiabatic mapping interpolation, allowing the analysis of subunit motions. We also added the option of using FRODA interpolation, which allows for more complex pathways, potentially overcoming steric barriers. We added an interface to a hinge prediction service, which acts on single structures and predicts likely residue points for flexibility. We developed tools to relate such points of flexibility in a structure to particular key residue positions, i.e. active sites or highly conserved positions. Lastly, we began relating our motion classification scheme to function using descriptions from the Gene Ontology Consortium.
ProTherm and ProNIT are two thermodynamic databases that contain experimentally determined thermodynamic parameters of protein stability and protein–nucleic acid interactions, respectively. The current versions of both the databases have considerably increased the total number of entries and enhanced search interface with added new fields, improved search, display and sorting options. As on September 2005, ProTherm release 5.0 contains 17 113 entries from 771 proteins, retrieved from 1497 scientific articles (∼20% increase in data from the previous version). ProNIT release 2.0 contains 4900 entries from 273 research articles, representing 158 proteins. Both databases can be queried using WWW interfaces. Both quick search and advanced search are provided on this web page to facilitate easy retrieval and display of the data from these databases. ProTherm is freely available online at http://gibk26.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/jouhou/Protherm/protherm.html and ProNIT at http://gibk26.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/jouhou/pronit/pronit.html.
To utilize effectively the growing number of verified genes that mediate an organism's ability to cause disease and/or to trigger host responses, we have developed PHI-base. This is a web-accessible database that currently catalogs 405 experimentally verified pathogenicity, virulence and effector genes from 54 fungal and Oomycete pathogens, of which 176 are from animal pathogens, 227 from plant pathogens and 3 from pathogens with a fungal host. PHI-base is the first on-line resource devoted to the identification and presentation of information on fungal and Oomycete pathogenicity genes and their host interactions. As such, PHI-base is a valuable resource for the discovery of candidate targets in medically and agronomically important fungal and Oomycete pathogens for intervention with synthetic chemistries and natural products. Each entry in PHI-base is curated by domain experts and supported by strong experimental evidence (gene/transcript disruption experiments) as well as literature references in which the experiments are described. Each gene in PHI-base is presented with its nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence as well as a detailed description of the predicted protein's function during the host infection process. To facilitate data interoperability, we have annotated genes using controlled vocabularies (Gene Ontology terms, Enzyme Commission Numbers and so on), and provide links to other external data sources (e.g. NCBI taxonomy and EMBL). We welcome new data for inclusion in PHI-base, which is freely accessed at www4.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk/phibase/.
The increasing amount of genomic and molecular information is the basis for understanding higher-order biological systems, such as the cell and the organism, and their interactions with the environment, as well as for medical, industrial and other practical applications. The KEGG resource (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) provides a reference knowledge base for linking genomes to biological systems, categorized as building blocks in the genomic space (KEGG GENES) and the chemical space (KEGG LIGAND), and wiring diagrams of interaction networks and reaction networks (KEGG PATHWAY). A fourth component, KEGG BRITE, has been formally added to the KEGG suite of databases. This reflects our attempt to computerize functional interpretations as part of the pathway reconstruction process based on the hierarchically structured knowledge about the genomic, chemical and network spaces. In accordance with the new chemical genomics initiatives, the scope of KEGG LIGAND has been significantly expanded to cover both endogenous and exogenous molecules. Specifically, RPAIR contains curated chemical structure transformation patterns extracted from known enzymatic reactions, which would enable analysis of genome-environment interactions, such as the prediction of new reactions and new enzyme genes that would degrade new environmental compounds. Additionally, drug information is now stored separately and linked to new KEGG DRUG structure maps.
The RTPrimerDB (http://medgen.ugent.be/rtprimerdb) project provides a freely accessible data retrieval system and an in silico assay evaluation pipeline for real-time quantitative PCR assays. Over the last year the number of user submitted assays has grown to 3500. Data conveyance from Entrez Gene by establishing an assay-to-gene relationship enables the addition of new primer assays for one of the 1.5 million different genes from 2300 species stored in the system. Easy access to the primer and probe data is possible by using multiple search criteria. Assay reports contain gene information, assay details (such as oligonucleotide sequences, detection chemistry and reaction conditions), publication information, users' experimental evaluation feedback and submitter's contact details. Gene expression assays are extended with a scalable assay viewer that provides detailed information on the alignment of primer and probe sequences on the known transcript variants of a gene, along with Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) positions and peptide domain information. Furthermore, an mfold module is implemented to predict the secondary structure of the amplicon sequence, as this has been reported to impact the efficiency of the PCR. RTPrimerDB is also extended with an in silico analysis pipeline to streamline the evaluation of custom designed primer and probe sequences prior to ordering and experimental evaluation. In a secured environment, the pipeline performs automated BLAST specificity searches, mfold secondary structure prediction, SNP or plain sequence error identification, and graphical visualization of the aligned primer and probe sequences on the target gene.
EMAGE (http://genex.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/Emage/database) is a freely available, curated database of gene expression patterns generated by in situ techniques in the developing mouse embryo. It is unique in that it contains standardized spatial representations of the sites of gene expression for each gene, denoted against a set of virtual reference embryo models. As such, the data can be interrogated in a novel and abstract manner by using space to define a query. Accompanying the spatial representations of gene expression patterns are text descriptions of the sites of expression, which also allows searching of the data by more conventional text-based methods.
The TRANSFAC® database on transcription factors, their binding sites, nucleotide distribution matrices and regulated genes as well as the complementing database TRANSCompel® on composite elements have been further enhanced on various levels. A new web interface with different search options and integrated versions of Match™ and Patch™ provides increased functionality for TRANSFAC®. The list of databases which are linked to the common GENE table of TRANSFAC® and TRANSCompel® has been extended by: Ensembl, UniGene, EntrezGene, HumanPSD™ and TRANSPRO™. Standard gene names from HGNC, MGI and RGD, are included for human, mouse and rat genes, respectively. With the help of InterProScan, Pfam, SMART and PROSITE domains are assigned automatically to the protein sequences of the transcription factors. TRANSCompel® contains now, in addition to the COMPEL table, a separate table for detailed information on the experimental EVIDENCE on which the composite elements are based. Finally, for TRANSFAC®, in respect of data growth, in particular the gain of Drosophila transcription factor binding sites (by courtesy of the Drosophila DNase I footprint database) and of Arabidopsis factors (by courtesy of DATF, Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors) has to be stressed. The here described public releases, TRANSFAC® 7.0 and TRANSCompel® 7.0, are accessible under http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/databases.html.
Use of RNA interference (RNAi) in forward genetic screens is proliferating. Currently, short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are being used to silence genes to tease out functional information. It is becoming easier to harness RNAi to silence specific genes, owing to the development of libraries of readymade shRNA and siRNA gene-silencing constructs by using a variety of sources. RNAi Codex, which consists of a database of shRNA related information and an associated website, has been developed as a portal for publicly available shRNA resources and is accessible at http://codex.cshl.org. RNAi Codex currently holds data from the Hannon–Elledge shRNA library and allows the use of biologist-friendly gene names to access information on shRNA constructs that can silence the gene of interest. It is designed to hold user-contributed annotations and publications for each construct, as and when such data become available. We will describe features of RNAi Codex and explain the use of the tool.
RNA interference (RNAi) has become a powerful tool for genetic screening in Drosophila. At the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center (DRSC), we are using a library of over 21 000 double-stranded RNAs targeting known and predicted genes in Drosophila. This library is available for the use of visiting scientists wishing to perform full-genome RNAi screens. The data generated from these screens are collected in the DRSC database (http://flyRNAi.org/cgi-bin/RNAi_screens.pl) in a flexible format for the convenience of the scientist and for archiving data. The long-term goal of this database is to provide annotations for as many of the uncharacterized genes in Drosophila as possible. Data from published screens are available to the public through a highly configurable interface that allows detailed examination of the data and provides access to a number of other databases and bioinformatics tools.
PRIDE, the ‘PRoteomics IDEntifications database’ (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) is a database of protein and peptide identifications that have been described in the scientific literature. These identifications will typically be from specific species, tissues and sub-cellular locations, perhaps under specific disease conditions. Any post-translational modifications that have been identified on individual peptides can be described. These identifications may be annotated with supporting mass spectra. At the time of writing, PRIDE includes the full set of identifications as submitted by individual laboratories participating in the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project and a profile of the human platelet proteome submitted by the University of Ghent in Belgium. By late 2005 PRIDE is expected to contain the identifications and spectra generated by the HUPO Brain Proteome Project. Proteomics laboratories are encouraged to submit their identifications and spectra to PRIDE to support their manuscript submissions to proteomics journals. Data can be submitted in PRIDE XML format if identifications are included or mzData format if the submitter is depositing mass spectra without identifications. PRIDE is a web application, so submission, searching and data retrieval can all be performed using an internet browser. PRIDE can be searched by experiment accession number, protein accession number, literature reference and sample parameters including species, tissue, sub-cellular location and disease state. Data can be retrieved as machine-readable PRIDE or mzData XML (the latter for mass spectra without identifications), or as human-readable HTML.
BioModels Database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), part of the international initiative BioModels.net, provides access to published, peer-reviewed, quantitative models of biochemical and cellular systems. Each model is carefully curated to verify that it corresponds to the reference publication and gives the proper numerical results. Curators also annotate the components of the models with terms from controlled vocabularies and links to other relevant data resources. This allows the users to search accurately for the models they need. The models can currently be retrieved in the SBML format, and import/export facilities are being developed to extend the spectrum of formats supported by the resource.
MODOMICS is the first comprehensive database resource for systems biology of RNA modification. It integrates information about the chemical structure of modified nucleosides, their localization in RNA sequences, pathways of their biosynthesis and enzymes that carry out the respective reactions. MODOMICS also provides literature information, and links to other databases, including the available protein sequence and structure data. The current list of modifications and pathways is comprehensive, while the dataset of enzymes is limited to Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and sequence alignments are presented only for tRNAs from these organisms. RNAs and enzymes from other organisms will be included in the near future. MODOMICS can be queried by the type of nucleoside (e.g. A, G, C, U, I, m1A, nm5s2U, etc.), type of RNA, position of a particular nucleoside, type of reaction (e.g. methylation, thiolation, deamination, etc.) and name or sequence of an enzyme of interest. Options for data presentation include graphs of pathways involving the query nucleoside, multiple sequence alignments of RNA sequences and tabular forms with enzyme and literature data. The contents of MODOMICS can be accessed through the World Wide Web at http://genesilico.pl/modomics/.
Transterm has now been publicly available for >10 years. Major changes have been made since its last description in this database issue in 2002. The current database provides data for key regions of mRNA sequences, a curated database of mRNA motifs and tools to allow users to investigate their own motifs or mRNA sequences. The key mRNA regions database is derived computationally from Genbank. It contains 3′ and 5′ flanking regions, the initiation and termination signal context and coding sequence for annotated CDS features from Genbank and RefSeq. The database is non-redundant, enabling summary files and statistics to be prepared for each species. Advances include providing extended search facilities, the database may now be searched by BLAST in addition to regular expressions (patterns) allowing users to search for motifs such as known miRNA sequences, and the inclusion of RefSeq data. The database contains >40 motifs or structural patterns important for translational control. In this release, patterns from UTRsite and Rfam are also incorporated with cross-referencing. Users may search their sequence data with Transterm or user-defined patterns. The system is accessible at http://uther.otago.ac.nz/Transterm.html.
TreeFam is a database of phylogenetic trees of gene families found in animals. It aims to develop a curated resource that presents the accurate evolutionary history of all animal gene families, as well as reliable ortholog and paralog assignments. Curated families are being added progressively, based on seed alignments and trees in a similar fashion to Pfam. Release 1.1 of TreeFam contains curated trees for 690 families and automatically generated trees for another 11 646 families. These represent over 128 000 genes from nine fully sequenced animal genomes and over 45 000 other animal proteins from UniProt; ∼40–85% of proteins encoded in the fully sequenced animal genomes are included in TreeFam. TreeFam is freely available at http://www.treefam.org and http://treefam.genomics.org.cn.
The Macromolecular Structure Database (MSD) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd/) [H. Boutselakis, D. Dimitropoulos, J. Fillon, A. Golovin, K. Henrick, A. Hussain, J. Ionides, M. John, P. A. Keller, E. Krissinel et al. (2003) E-MSD: the European Bioinformatics Institute Macromolecular Structure Database. Nucleic Acids Res., 31, 458–462.] group is one of the three partners in the worldwide Protein DataBank (wwPDB), the consortium entrusted with the collation, maintenance and distribution of the global repository of macromolecular structure data [H. Berman, K. Henrick and H. Nakamura (2003) Announcing the worldwide Protein Data Bank. Nature Struct. Biol., 10, 980.]. Since its inception, the MSD group has worked with partners around the world to improve the quality of PDB data, through a clean up programme that addresses inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the legacy archive. The improvements in data quality in the legacy archive have been achieved largely through the creation of a unified data archive, in the form of a relational database that stores all of the data in the wwPDB. The three partners are working towards improving the tools and methods for the deposition of new data by the community at large. The implementation of the MSD database, together with the parallel development of improved tools and methodologies for data harvesting, validation and archival, has lead to significant improvements in the quality of data that enters the archive. Through this and related projects in the NMR and EM realms the MSD continues to improve the quality of publicly available structural data.
The MIPS Fusarium graminearum Genome Database (FGDB) is a comprehensive genome database on one of the most devastating fungal plant pathogens of wheat and barley. FGDB provides information on two gene sets independently derived by automated annotation of the F.graminearum genome sequence. A complete manually revised gene set will be completed within the near future. The initial results of systematic manual correction of gene calls are already part of the current gene set. The database can be accessed to retrieve information from bioinformatics analyses and functional classifications of the proteins. The data are also organized in the well established MIPS catalogs and novel query techniques are available to search the data. The comprehensive set of gene calls was also used for the design of an Affymetrix GeneChip. The resource is accessible on http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/fusarium/.
As more archaeal genomes are sequenced, effective research and analysis tools are needed to integrate the diverse information available for any given locus. The feature-rich UCSC Genome Browser, created originally to annotate the human genome, can be applied to any sequenced organism. We have created a UCSC Archaeal Genome Browser, available at http://archaea.ucsc.edu/, currently with 26 archaeal genomes. It displays G/C content, gene and operon annotation from multiple sources, sequence motifs (promoters and Shine-Dalgarno), microarray data, multi-genome alignments and protein conservation across phylogenetic and habitat categories. We encourage submission of new experimental and bioinformatic analysis from contributors. The purpose of this tool is to aid biological discovery and facilitate greater collaboration within the archaeal research community.
Listeria species are ubiquitous in the environment and often contaminate foods because they grow under conditions used for food preservation. Listeria monocytogenes, the human and animal pathogen, causes Listeriosis, an infection with a high mortality rate in risk groups such as immune-compromised individuals. Furthermore, L.monocytogenes is a model organism for the study of intracellular bacterial pathogens. The publication of its genome sequence and that of the non-pathogenic species Listeria innocua initiated numerous comparative studies and efforts to sequence all species comprising the genus. The Proteome database LEGER (http://leger2.gbf.de/cgi-bin/expLeger.pl) was developed to support functional genome analyses by combining information obtained by applying bioinformatics methods and from public databases to improve the original annotations. LEGER offers three unique key features: (i) it is the first comprehensive information system focusing on the functional assignment of genes and proteins; (ii) integrated visualization tools, KEGG pathway and Genome Viewer, alleviate the functional exploration of complex data; and (iii) LEGER presents results of systematic post-genome studies, thus facilitating analyses combining computational and experimental results. Moreover, LEGER provides an unpublished membrane proteome analysis of L.innocua and in total visualizes experimentally validated information about the subcellular localizations of 789 different listerial proteins.
The LIPID MAPS Proteome Database (LMPD) is an object-relational database of lipid-associated protein sequences and annotations. The initial release contains 2959 records, representing human and mouse proteins involved in lipid metabolism. UniProt IDs were obtained based on keyword search of KEGG and GO databases, and this LMPD protein list was then enhanced with annotations from UniProt, EntrezGene, ENZYME, GO, KEGG and other public resources. We also assigned associations with general lipid categories, based on GO and KEGG annotations. Users may search LMPD by database ID or keyword, and filter by species and/or lipid class associations; from the search results, one can then access a compilation of data relevant to each protein of interest, cross-linked to external databases. The LIPID MAPS Proteome Database (LMPD) is publicly available from the LIPID MAPS Consortium website (http://www.lipidmaps.org/). The direct URL is http://www.lipidmaps.org/data/proteome/index.cgi.
DrugBank is a unique bioinformatics/cheminformatics resource that combines detailed drug (i.e. chemical) data with comprehensive drug target (i.e. protein) information. The database contains >4100 drug entries including >800 FDA approved small molecule and biotech drugs as well as >3200 experimental drugs. Additionally, >14 000 protein or drug target sequences are linked to these drug entries. Each DrugCard entry contains >80 data fields with half of the information being devoted to drug/chemical data and the other half devoted to drug target or protein data. Many data fields are hyperlinked to other databases (KEGG, PubChem, ChEBI, PDB, Swiss-Prot and GenBank) and a variety of structure viewing applets. The database is fully searchable supporting extensive text, sequence, chemical structure and relational query searches. Potential applications of DrugBank include in silico drug target discovery, drug design, drug docking or screening, drug metabolism prediction, drug interaction prediction and general pharmaceutical education. DrugBank is available at http://redpoll.pharmacy.ualberta.ca/drugbank/.
HvrBase++ is the improved and extended version of HvrBase. Extensions are made by adding more population-based sequence samples from all primates including humans. The current collection comprises 13 873 hypervariable region I (HVRI) sequences and 4940 hypervariable region II (HVRII) sequences. In addition, we included 1376 complete mitochondrial genomes, 205 sequences from X-chromosomal loci and 202 sequences from autosomal chromosomes 1, 8, 11 and 16. In order to reduce the introduction of erroneous data into HvrBase++, we have developed a procedure that monitors GenBank for new versions of the current data in HvrBase++ and automatically updates the collection if necessary. For the stored sequences, supplementary information such as geographic origin, population affiliation and language of the sequence donor can be retrieved. HvrBase++ is Oracle based and easily accessible by a web interface (http://www.hvrbase.org). As a new key feature, HvrBase++ provides an interactive graphical tool to easily access data from dynamically created geographical maps.
Polyadenylation of nascent transcripts is one of the key mRNA processing events in eukaryotic cells. A large number of human and mouse genes have alternative polyadenylation sites, or poly(A) sites, leading to mRNA variants with different protein products and/or 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs). PolyA_DB 2 contains poly(A) sites identified for genes in several vertebrate species, including human, mouse, rat, chicken and zebrafish, using alignments between cDNA/ESTs and genome sequences. Several new features have been added to the database since its last release, including syntenic genome regions for human poly(A) sites in seven other vertebrates and cis-element information adjacent to poly(A) sites. Trace sequences are used to provide additional evidence for poly(A/T) tails in cDNA/ESTs. The updated database is intended to broaden poly(A) site coverage in vertebrate genomes, and provide means to assess the authenticity of poly(A) sites identified by bioinformatics. The URL for this database is .
FlyBase () is the primary database of genetic and genomic data for the insect family Drosophilidae. Historically, Drosophila melanogaster has been the most extensively studied species in this family, but recent determination of the genomic sequences of an additional 11 Drosophila species opens up new avenues of research for other Drosophila species. This extensive sequence resource, encompassing species with well-defined phylogenetic relationships, provides a model system for comparative genomic analyses. FlyBase has developed tools to facilitate access to and navigation through this invaluable new data collection.
Inherited genetic variation plays a critical but largely uncharacterized role in human differentiation. The completion of the International HapMap Project makes it possible to identify loci that may cause human differentiation. We have devised an approach to find such ethnically variant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (ESNPs) from the genotype profile of the populations included in the International HapMap database. We selected ESNPs using the nearest shrunken centroid method (NSCM), and performed multiple tests for genetic heterogeneity and frequency spectrum on genes having ESNPs. The function and disease association of the selected SNPs were also annotated. This resulted in the identification of 100 736 SNPs that appeared uniquely in each ethnic group. Of these SNPs, 1009 were within disease-associated genes, and 85 were predicted as damaging using the Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant system. This study resulted in the creation of the SNP@Ethnos database, which is designed to make this type of detailed genetic variation approach available to a wider range of researchers. SNP@Ethnos is a public database of ESNPs with annotation information that currently contains 100 736 ESNPs from 10 138 genes, and can be accessed at  and  or directly at .
The defensins knowledgebase is a manually curated database and information source focused on the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. The current version of the database holds a comprehensive collection of over 350 defensin records each containing sequence, structure and activity information. A web-based interface provides access to the information and allows for text-based searching on the data fields. In addition, the website presents information on patents, grants, research laboratories and scientists, clinical studies and commercial entities pertaining to defensins. With the rapidly increasing interest in defensins, we hope that the knowledgebase will prove to be a valuable resource in the field of antimicrobial peptide research. The defensins knowledgebase is available at .
Substantial new features have been implemented at the Ribosomal Database Project in response to the increased importance of high-throughput rRNA sequence analysis in microbial ecology and related disciplines. The most important changes include quality analysis, including chimera detection, for all available rRNA sequences and the introduction of myRDP Space, a new web component designed to help researchers place their own data in context with the RDP's data. In addition, new video tutorials describe how to use RDP features. Details about RDP data and analytical functions can be found at the RDP-II website ().
The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is currently the most complete and comprehensive curated collection of human metabolite and human metabolism data in the world. It contains records for more than 2180 endogenous metabolites with information gathered from thousands of books, journal articles and electronic databases. In addition to its comprehensive literature-derived data, the HMDB also contains an extensive collection of experimental metabolite concentration data compiled from hundreds of mass spectra (MS) and Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic analyses performed on urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples. This is further supplemented with thousands of NMR and MS spectra collected on purified, reference metabolites. Each metabolite entry in the HMDB contains an average of 90 separate data fields including a comprehensive compound description, names and synonyms, structural information, physico-chemical data, reference NMR and MS spectra, biofluid concentrations, disease associations, pathway information, enzyme data, gene sequence data, SNP and mutation data as well as extensive links to images, references and other public databases. Extensive searching, relational querying and data browsing tools are also provided. The HMDB is designed to address the broad needs of biochemists, clinical chemists, physicians, medical geneticists, nutritionists and members of the metabolomics community. The HMDB is available at:

The database features over 126 000 binary interactions extracted from over 2100 scientific publications and makes extensive use of controlled vocabularies. The web site provides tools allowing users to search, visualize and download data from the repository. IntAct supports and encourages local installations as well as direct data submission and curation collaborations. IntAct source code and data are freely available from .
Eukaryotic Subcellular Localization DataBase collects the annotations of subcellular localization of eukaryotic proteomes. So far five proteomes have been processed and stored: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. For each sequence, the database lists localization obtained adopting three different approaches: (i) experimentally determined (when available); (ii) homology-based (when possible); and (iii) predicted. The latter is computed with a suite of machine learning based methods, developed in house. All the data are available at our website and can be searched by sequence, by protein code and/or by protein description. Furthermore, a more complex search can be performed combining different search fields and keys. All the data contained in the database can be freely downloaded in flat file format. The database is available at .
The Database of Protein Disorder (DisProt) links structure and function information for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Intrinsically disordered proteins do not form a fixed three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions, either in their entireties or in segments or regions. We define IDP as a protein that contains at least one experimentally determined disordered region. Although lacking fixed structure, IDPs and regions carry out important biological functions, being typically involved in regulation, signaling and control. Such functions can involve high-specificity low-affinity interactions, the multiple binding of one protein to many partners and the multiple binding of many proteins to one partner. These three features are all enabled and enhanced by protein intrinsic disorder. One of the major hindrances in the study of IDPs has been the lack of organized information. DisProt was developed to enable IDP research by collecting and organizing knowledge regarding the experimental characterization and the functional associations of IDPs. In addition to being a unique source of biological information, DisProt opens doors for a plethora of bioinformatics studies. DisProt is openly available at .
The Drosophila species comparative genome database DroSpeGe () provides genome researchers with rapid, usable access to 12 new and old Drosophila genomes, since its inception in 2004. Scientists can use, with minimal computing expertise, the wealth of new genome information for developing new insights into insect evolution. New genome assemblies provided by several sequencing centers have been annotated with known model organism gene homologies and gene predictions to provided basic comparative data. TeraGrid supplies the shared cyberinfrastructure for the primary computations. This genome database includes homologies to Drosophila melanogaster and eight other eukaryote model genomes, and gene predictions from several groups. BLAST searches of the newest assemblies are integrated with genome maps. GBrowse maps provide detailed views of cross-species aligned genomes. BioMart provides for data mining of annotations and sequences. Common chromosome maps identify major synteny among species. Potential gain and loss of genes is suggested by Gene Ontology groupings for genes of the new species. Summaries of essential genome statistics include sizes, genes found and predicted, homology among genomes, phylogenetic trees of species and comparisons of several gene predictions for sensitivity and specificity in finding new and known genes.
The microbial genome database for comparative analysis (MBGD) is a comprehensive platform for microbial comparative genomics. The central function of MBGD is to create orthologous groups among multiple genomes from precomputed all-against-all similarity relationships using the DomClust algorithm. The database now contains >300 published genomes and the number continues to grow. For researchers who are interested in ongoing genome projects, we have now started a new service called ‘My MBGD,’ which allows users to add their own genome sequences to MBGD for the purpose of identifying orthologs among both the new and the existing genomes. Furthermore, in order to make available the rapidly accumulating information on closely related genome sequences, we enhanced the interface for pairwise genome comparisons using the CGAT interface, which allows users to see nucleotide sequence alignments of non-coding as well as coding regions. MBGD is available at .
We formerly released the porcine expressed sequence tag (EST) database Pig EST Data Explorer (PEDE; ), which comprised 68 076 high-quality ESTs obtained by using full-length-enriched cDNA libraries derived from seven tissues. We have added eight tissues and cell types to the EST analysis and have integrated 94 555 additional high-quality ESTs into the database. We also fully sequenced the inserts of 10 147 of the cDNA clones that had undergone EST analysis; the sequences and annotation of the cDNA clones were stored in the database. Further, we constructed an interface that can be used to perform various searches in the database. The PEDE database is the primary resource of expressed pig genes that are supported by full-length cDNA sequences. This resource not only enables us to pick cDNA clones of interest for a particular analysis, but it also confirms and thus contributes to the sequencing integrity of the pig genome, which is now being compiled by an international consortium (). PEDE has therefore evolved into what we now call ‘Pig Expression Data Explorer’.
The genome sequence framework provided by the human genome project allows us to precisely map human genetic variations in order to study their association with disease and their direct effects on gene function. Since the description of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes several decades ago, both germ-line variations and somatic mutations have been established to be important in cancer—in terms of risk, oncogenesis, prognosis and response to therapy. The Cancer Genome Atlas initiative proposed by the NIH is poised to elucidate the contribution of somatic mutations to cancer development and progression through the re-sequencing of a substantial fraction of the total collection of human genes—in hundreds of individual tumors and spanning several tumor types. We have developed the CancerGenes resource to simplify the process of gene selection and prioritization in large collaborative projects. CancerGenes combines gene lists annotated by experts with information from key public databases. Each gene is annotated with gene name(s), functional description, organism, chromosome number, location, Entrez Gene ID, GO terms, InterPro descriptions, gene structure, protein length, transcript count, and experimentally determined transcript control regions, as well as links to Entrez Gene, COSMIC, and iHOP gene pages and the UCSC and Ensembl genome browsers. The user-friendly interface provides for searching, sorting and intersection of gene lists. Users may view tabulated results through a web browser or may dynamically download them as a spreadsheet table. CancerGenes is available at .
U12-type introns are spliced by the U12-dependent spliceosome and are present in the genomes of many higher eukaryotic lineages including plants, chordates and some invertebrates. However, due to their relatively recent discovery and a systematic bias against recognition of non-canonical splice sites in general, the introns defined by U12-type splice sites are under-represented in genome annotations. Such under-representation compounds the already difficult problem of determining gene structures. It also impedes attempts to study these introns genome-wide or phylum-wide. The resource described here, the U12 Intron Database (U12DB), aims to catalog the U12-type introns of completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes in a framework that groups orthologous introns with each other. This will aid further investigations into the evolution and mechanism of U12-dependent splicing as well as assist ongoing genome annotation efforts. Public access to the U12DB is available at .
Frequent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza and the increasing data available for comparative analysis require a central database specialized in influenza viruses (IVs). We have established the Influenza Virus Database (IVDB) to integrate information and create an analysis platform for genetic, genomic, and phylogenetic studies of the virus. IVDB hosts complete genome sequences of influenza A virus generated by Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG) and curates all other published IV sequences after expert annotation. Our Q-Filter system classifies and ranks all nucleotide sequences into seven categories according to sequence content and integrity. IVDB provides a series of tools and viewers for comparative analysis of the viral genomes, genes, genetic polymorphisms and phylogenetic relationships. A search system has been developed for users to retrieve a combination of different data types by setting search options. To facilitate analysis of global viral transmission and evolution, the IV Sequence Distribution Tool (IVDT) has been developed to display the worldwide geographic distribution of chosen viral genotypes and to couple genomic data with epidemiological data. The BLAST, multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis tools were integrated for online data analysis. Furthermore, IVDB offers instant access to pre-computed alignments and polymorphisms of IV genes and proteins, and presents the results as SNP distribution plots and minor allele distributions. IVDB is publicly available at 
Protein domains are subunits of proteins that recur throughout the protein world. There are many definitions attempting to capture the essence of a protein domain, and several systems that identify protein domains and classify them into families. EVEREST, recently described in Portugaly et al. (2006) BMC Bioinformatics, 7, 277, is one such system that performs the task automatically, using protein sequence alone. Herein we describe EVEREST release 2.0, consisting of 20 029 families, each defined by one or more HMMs. The current EVEREST database was constructed by scanning UniProt 8.1 and all PDB sequences (total over 3 000 000 sequences) with each of the EVEREST families. EVEREST annotates 64% of all sequences, and covers 59% of all residues. EVEREST is available at . The website provides annotations given by SCOP, CATH, Pfam A and EVEREST. It allows for browsing through the families of each of those sources, graphically visualizing the domain organization of the proteins in the family. The website also provides access to analyzes of relationships between domain families, within and across domain definition systems. Users can upload sequences for analysis by the set of EVEREST families. Finally an advanced search form allows querying for families matching criteria regarding novelty, phylogenetic composition and more.
Long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons comprise a significant portion of the rice genome. Their complete characterization is thus necessary if the sequenced genome is to be annotated correctly. In addition, because LTR-retrotransposons can influence the expression of neighboring genes, the complete identification of these elements in the rice genome is essential in order to study their putative functional interactions with the plant genes. The aims of the database are to (i) Assemble a comprehensive dataset of LTR-retrotransposons that includes not only abundant elements, but also low copy number elements. (ii) Provide an interface to efficiently access the resources stored in the database. This interface should also allow the community to annotate these elements. (iii) Provide a means for identifying LTR-retrotransposons inserted near genes. Here we present the results, where 242 complete LTR-retrotransposons have been structurally and functionally annotated. A web interface to the database has been made available (), through which the user can annotate a sequence or search for LTR-retrotransposons in the neighborhood of a gene of interest.
With the advent of automated and high-throughput techniques, the number of patent applications containing biological sequences has been increasing rapidly. However, they have attracted relatively little attention compared to other sequence resources. We have built a database server called Patome, which contains biological sequence data disclosed in patents and published applications, as well as their analysis information. The analysis is divided into two steps. The first is an annotation step in which the disclosed sequences were annotated with RefSeq database. The second is an association step where the sequences were linked to Entrez Gene, OMIM and GO databases, and their results were saved as a gene–patent table. From the analysis, we found that 55% of human genes were associated with patenting. The gene–patent table can be used to identify whether a particular gene or disease is related to patenting. Patome is available at ; the information is updated bimonthly.
Transcriptional cis-regulatory control regions frequently are found within non-coding DNA segments conserved across multi-species gene orthologs. Adopting a systematic gene-centric pipeline approach, we report here the development of a web-accessible database resource—GenomeTraFac ()—that allows genome-wide detection and characterization of compositionally similar cis-clusters that occur in gene orthologs between any two genomes for both microRNA genes as well as conventional RNA-encoding genes. Each ortholog gene pair can be scanned to visualize overall conserved sequence regions, and within these, the relative density of conserved cis-element motif clusters form graph peak structures. The results of these analyses can be mined en masse to identify most frequently represented cis-motifs in a list of genes. The system also provides a method for rapid evaluation and visualization of gene model-consistency between orthologs, and facilitates consideration of the potential impact of sequence variation in conserved non-coding regions to impact complex cis-element structures. Using the mouse and human genomes via the NCBI Reference Sequence database and the Sanger Institute miRBase, the system demonstrated the ability to identify validated transcription factor targets within promoter and distal genomic regulatory regions of both conventional and microRNA genes.
There has been widespread and growing interest in genetic markers suitable for drawing population genetic inferences about past demographic events and to detect the effects of selection. In addition to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), microsatellites (or short tandem repeats, STRs) have received great attention in the analysis of human population history. In the SNPSTR database () we catalogue a relatively new type of compound genetic marker called SNPSTR which combines a microsatellite marker (STR) with one or more tightly linked SNPs. Here, the SNP(s) and the microsatellite are less than 250 bp apart so each SNPSTR can be considered a small haplotype with no recombination occurring between the two individual markers. Thus, SNPSTRs have the potential to become a very useful tool in the field of population genetics. The SNPSTR database contains all inferable human SNPSTRs as well as those in mouse, rat, dog and chicken, i.e. all model organisms for which extensive SNP datasets are available.
To bridge the gap between the rising information needs of biological and medical researchers and the rapidly growing number of online bioinformatics resources, we have created the Online Bioinformatics Resources Collection (OBRC) at the Health Sciences Library System (HSLS) at the University of Pittsburgh. The OBRC, containing 1542 major online bioinformatics databases and software tools, was constructed using the HSLS content management system built on the Zope® Web application server. To enhance the output of search results, we further implemented the Vivísimo Clustering Engine®, which automatically organizes the search results into categories created dynamically based on the textual information of the retrieved records. As the largest online collection of its kind and the only one with advanced search results clustering, OBRC is aimed at becoming a one-stop guided information gateway to the major bioinformatics databases and software tools on the Web. OBRC is available at the University of Pittsburgh's HSLS Web site ().
The Pseudogene.org knowledgebase serves as a comprehensive repository for pseudogene annotation. The definition of a pseudogene varies within the literature, resulting in significantly different approaches to the problem of identification. Consequently, it is difficult to maintain a consistent collection of pseudogenes in detail necessary for their effective use. Our database is designed to address this issue. It integrates a variety of heterogeneous resources and supports a subset structure that highlights specific groups of pseudogenes that are of interest to the research community. Tools are provided for the comparison of sets and the creation of layered set unions, enabling researchers to derive a current ‘consensus’ set of pseudogenes. Additional features include versatile search, the capacity for robust interaction with other databases, the ability to reconstruct older versions of the database (accounting for changing genome builds) and an underlying object-oriented interface designed for researchers with a minimal knowledge of programming. At the present time, the database contains more than 100 000 pseudogenes spanning 64 prokaryote and 11 eukaryote genomes, including a collection of human annotations compiled from 16 sources.
Polymorphism in microRNA Target Site (PolymiRTS) database is a collection of naturally occurring DNA variations in putative microRNA target sites. PolymiRTSs may affect gene expression and cause variations in complex phenotypes. The database integrates sequence polymorphism, phenotype and expression microarray data, and characterizes PolymiRTSs as potential candidates responsible for the quantitative trait locus (QTL) effects. It is a resource for studying PolymiRTSs and their implications in phenotypic variations. PolymiRTS database can be accessed at .
InSatDb presents an interactive interface to query information regarding microsatellite characteristics per se of five fully sequenced insect genomes (fruit-fly, honeybee, malarial mosquito, red-flour beetle and silkworm). InSatDb allows users to obtain microsatellites annotated with size (in base pairs and repeat units); genomic location (exon, intron, up-stream or transposon); nature (perfect or imperfect); and sequence composition (repeat motif and GC%). One can access microsatellite cluster (compound repeats) information and a list of microsatellites with conserved flanking sequences (microsatellite family or paralogs). InSatDb is complete with the insects information, web links to find details, methodology and a tutorial. A separate ‘Analysis’ section illustrates the comparative genomic analysis that can be carried out using the output. InSatDb is available at .
The Sulfolobus database () integrates, for the first time, all currently available Sulfolobus chromosome sequences with annotations. It also includes all the sequence data for the extrachromosomal elements which can propagate in Sulfolobus organisms. All genomes and annotations deposited in GenBank are included in the database and a genefinder has been run on the sequences to ensure that all potential genes are present, and identifiable, in the database. Every month, all genes are searched against a range of external databases and new results are incorporated. The Sulfolobus database was developed as an asset to the rapidly-growing international community working with Sulfolobus as a model organism for the kingdom Crenarchaeota of the Archaea. It was accessed more that 46 000 times in its first year. The database aims to provide researchers easy access to sequence and gene information and the web-interface includes various searches, free text and BLAST, as well as genome browsing and data extraction. Updated annotations are incorporated regularly and the database will continue to expand as new information becomes available. This includes new sequences, newly identified genes, annotations and other related information.
The Protein Folding Database (PFD) is a publicly accessible repository of thermodynamic and kinetic protein folding data. Here we describe the first major revision of this work, featuring extensive restructuring that conforms to standards set out by the recently formed International Foldeomics Consortium. The database now adopts standards for data acquisition, analysis and reporting proposed by the consortium, which will facilitate the comparison of folding rates, energies and structure across diverse sets of proteins. Data can now be easily deposited using a rich set of deposition tools. Enhanced search tools allow sophisticated searching and graphical data analysis affords simple data analysis online. PFD can be accessed freely at .
The Ensembl () project provides a comprehensive and integrated source of annotation of chordate genome sequences. Over the past year the number of genomes available from Ensembl has increased from 15 to 33, with the addition of sites for the mammalian genomes of elephant, rabbit, armadillo, tenrec, platypus, pig, cat, bush baby, common shrew, microbat and european hedgehog; the fish genomes of stickleback and medaka and the second example of the genomes of the sea squirt (Ciona savignyi) and the mosquito (Aedes aegypti). Some of the major features added during the year include the first complete gene sets for genomes with low-sequence coverage, the introduction of new strain variation data and the introduction of new orthology/paralog annotations based on gene trees.
Subtle alternative splice events at tandem splice sites are frequent in eukaryotes and substantially increase the complexity of transcriptomes and proteomes. We have developed a relational database, TassDB (TAndem Splice Site DataBase), which stores extensive data about alternative splice events at GYNGYN donors and NAGNAG acceptors. These splice events are of subtle nature since they mostly result in the insertion/deletion of a single amino acid or the substitution of one amino acid by two others. Currently, TassDB contains 114 554 tandem splice sites of eight species, 5209 of which have EST/mRNA evidence for alternative splicing. In addition, human SNPs that affect NAGNAG acceptors are annotated. The database provides a user-friendly interface to search for specific genes or for genes containing tandem splice sites with specific features as well as the possibility to download large datasets. This database should facilitate further experimental studies and large-scale bioinformatics analyses of tandem splice sites. The database is available at .
MACiE (Mechanism, Annotation and Classification in Enzymes) is a database of enzyme reaction mechanisms, and is publicly available as a web-based data resource. This paper presents the first release of a web-based search tool to explore enzyme reaction mechanisms in MACiE. We also present Version 2 of MACiE, which doubles the dataset available (from Version 1). MACiE can be accessed from 
We report the latest release (version 3.0) of the CATH protein domain database (). There has been a 20% increase in the number of structural domains classified in CATH, up to 86 151 domains. Release 3.0 comprises 1110 fold groups and 2147 homologous superfamilies. To cope with the increases in diverse structural homologues being determined by the structural genomics initiatives, more sensitive methods have been developed for identifying boundaries in multi-domain proteins and for recognising homologues. The CATH classification update is now being driven by an integrated pipeline that links these automated procedures with validation steps, that have been made easier by the provision of information rich web pages summarising comparison scores and relevant links to external sites for each domain being classified. An analysis of the population of domains in the CATH hierarchy and several domain characteristics are presented for version 3.0. We also report an update of the CATH Dictionary of homologous structures (CATH-DHS) which now contains multiple structural alignments, consensus information and functional annotations for 1459 well populated superfamilies in CATH. CATH is directly linked to the Gene3D database which is a projection of CATH structural data onto ∼2 million sequences in completed genomes and UniProt.
Phosphorylation is the most common protein post-translational modification. Phosphorylated residues (serine, threonine and tyrosine) play critical roles in the regulation of many cellular processes. Since the amount of data produced by screening assays is growing continuously, the development of computational tools for collecting and analysing experimental data has become a pivotal task for unravelling the complex network of interactions regulating eukaryotic cell life. Here we present Phospho3D, , a database of 3D structures of phosphorylation sites, which stores information retrieved from the phospho.ELM database and is enriched with structural information and annotations at the residue level. The database also collects the results of a large-scale structural comparison procedure providing clues for the identification of new putative phosphorylation sites.
Replication of eukaryotic chromosomes initiates at multiple sites called replication origins. Replication origins are best understood in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where several complementary studies have mapped their locations genome-wide. We have collated these datasets, taking account of the resolution of each study, to generate a single list of distinct origin sites. OriDB provides a web-based catalogue of these confirmed and predicted S.cerevisiae DNA replication origin sites. Each proposed or confirmed origin site appears as a record in OriDB, with each record comprising seven pages. These pages provide, in text and graphical formats, the following information: genomic location and chromosome context of the origin site; time of origin replication; DNA sequence of proposed or experimentally confirmed origin elements; free energy required to open the DNA duplex (stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization or SIDD); and phylogenetic conservation of sequence elements. In addition, OriDB encourages community submission of additional information for each origin site through a User Notes facility. Origin sites are linked to several external resources, including the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) and relevant publications at PubMed. Finally, a Chromosome Viewer utility allows users to interactively generate graphical representations of DNA replication data genome-wide. OriDB is available at .
As knowledge of human genetic polymorphisms grows, so does the opportunity and challenge of identifying those polymorphisms that may impact the health or disease risk of an individual person. A critical need is to organize large-scale polymorphism analyses and to prioritize candidate non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) that should be tested in experimental and epidemiological studies to establish their context-specific impacts on protein function. In addition, with emerging high-resolution clinical genetics testing, new polymorphisms must be analyzed in the context of all available protein feature knowledge including other known mutations and polymorphisms. To approach this, we developed PolyDoms () as a database to integrate the results of multiple algorithmic procedures and functional criteria applied to the entire Entrez dbSNP dataset. In addition to predicting structural and functional impacts of all nsSNPs, filtering functions enable group-based identification of potentially harmful nsSNPs among multiple genes associated with specific diseases, anatomies, mammalian phenotypes, gene ontologies, pathways or protein domains. PolyDoms, thus, provides a means to derive a list of candidate SNPs to be evaluated in experimental or epidemiological studies for impact on protein functions and disease risk associations. PolyDoms will continue to be curated to improve its usefulness.
In addition to maintaining the GenBank® nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides analysis and retrieval resources for the data in GenBank and other biological data made available through NCBI's Web site. NCBI resources include Entrez, the Entrez Programming Utilities, My NCBI, PubMed, PubMed Central, Entrez Gene, the NCBI Taxonomy Browser, BLAST, BLAST Link(BLink), Electronic PCR, OrfFinder, Spidey, Splign, RefSeq, UniGene, HomoloGene, ProtEST, dbMHC, dbSNP, Cancer Chromosomes, Entrez Genome, Genome Project and related tools, the Trace and Assembly Archives, the Map Viewer, Model Maker, Evidence Viewer, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs), Viral Genotyping Tools, Influenza Viral Resources, HIV-1/Human Protein Interaction Database, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Entrez Probe, GENSAT, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA), the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), the Conserved Domain Database (CDD), the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART) and the PubChem suite of small molecule databases. Augmenting many of the Web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets. These resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at .
Frequency of INherited Disorders database (FINDbase) () is a relational database, derived from the ETHNOS software, recording frequencies of causative mutations leading to inherited disorders worldwide. Database records include the population and ethnic group, the disorder name and the related gene, accompanied by links to any corresponding locus-specific mutation database, to the respective Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man entries and the mutation together with its frequency in that population. The initial information is derived from the published literature, locus-specific databases and genetic disease consortia. FINDbase offers a user-friendly query interface, providing instant access to the list and frequencies of the different mutations. Query outputs can be either in a table or graphical format, accompanied by reference(s) on the data source. Registered users from three different groups, namely administrator, national coordinator and curator, are responsible for database curation and/or data entry/correction online via a password-protected interface. Databaseaccess is free of charge and there are no registration requirements for data querying. FINDbase provides a simple, web-based system for population-based mutation data collection and retrieval and can serve not only as a valuable online tool for molecular genetic testing of inherited disorders but also as a non-profit model for sustainable database funding, in the form of a ‘database-journal’.
The ability to store and interconnect all available information on proteins is crucial to modern biological research. Accordingly, the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) plays an increasingly important role by providing a stable, comprehensive, freely accessible central resource on protein sequences and functional annotation. UniProt is produced by the UniProt Consortium, formed in 2002 by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Protein Information Resource (PIR) and the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB). The core activities include manual curation of protein sequences assisted by computational analysis, sequence archiving, development of a user-friendly UniProt web site and the provision of additional value-added information through cross-references to other databases. UniProt is comprised of three major components, each optimized for different uses: the UniProt Archive, the UniProt Knowledgebase and the UniProt Reference Clusters. An additional component consisting of metagenomic and environmental sequences has recently been added to UniProt to ensure availability of such sequences in a timely fashion. UniProt is updated and distributed on a bi-weekly basis and can be accessed online for searches or download at .
Functional glycomics, the scientific attempt to identify and assign functions to all glycan molecules synthesized by an organism, is an emerging field of science. In recent years, several databases have been started, all aiming to support deciphering the biological function of carbohydrates. However, diverse encoding and storage schemes are in use amongst these databases, significantly hampering the interchange of data. The mutual online access between the Bacterial Carbohydrate Structure DataBase (BCSDB) and the GLYCOSCIENCES.de portal, as a first reported attempt of a structure-based direct interconnection of two glyco-related databases is described. In this approach, users have to learn only one interface, will always have access to the latest data of both services, and will have the results of both searches presented in a consistent way. The establishment of this connection helped to find shortcomings and inconsistencies in the database design and functionality related to underlying data concepts and structural representations. For the maintenance of the databases, duplication of work can be easily avoided, and will hopefully lead to a better worldwide acceptance of both services within the community of glycoscienists. BCSDB is available at  and the GLYCOSCIENCES.de portal at 
Three-dimensional (3D) structure is now known for a large fraction of all protein families. Thus, it has become rather likely that one will find a homolog with known 3D structure when searching a sequence database with an arbitrary query sequence. Depending on the extent of similarity, such neighbor relationships may allow one to infer biological function and to identify functional sites such as binding motifs or catalytic centers. Entrez's 3D-structure database, the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), provides easy access to the richness of 3D structure data and its large potential for functional annotation. Entrez's search engine offers several tools to assist biologist users: (i) links between databases, such as between protein sequences and structures, (ii) pre-computed sequence and structure neighbors, (iii) visualization of structure and sequence/structure alignment. Here, we describe an annotation service that combines some of these tools automatically, Entrez's ‘Related Structure’ links. For all proteins in Entrez, similar sequences with known 3D structure are detected by BLAST and alignments are recorded. The ‘Related Structure’ service summarizes this information and presents 3D views mapping sequence residues onto all 3D structures available in MMDB ().
Systematic mapping of protein–protein interactions has become a central task of functional genomics. To map the human interactome, several strategies have recently been pursued. The generated interaction datasets are valuable resources for scientists in biology and medicine. However, comparison reveals limited overlap between different interaction networks. This divergence obstructs usability, as researchers have to interrogate numerous heterogeneous datasets to identify potential interaction partners for proteins of interest. To facilitate direct access through a single entry gate, we have started to integrate currently available human protein interaction data in an easily accessible online database. It is called UniHI (Unified Human Interactome) and is available at . At present, it is based on 10 major interaction maps derived by computational and experimental methods. It includes more than 150 000 distinct interactions between more than 17 000 unique human proteins. UniHI provides researchers with a flexible integrated tool for finding and using comprehensive information about the human interactome.
The GeneTrees phylogenomics system pursues comparative genomic analyses from the perspective of gene phylogenies for individual genes. The GeneTrees project has the goal of providing detailed evolutionary models for all protein-coding gene components of the fully sequenced genomes. Currently, a database of alignments and trees for all protein sequences for 325 fully sequenced and annotated prokaryote genomes is available. The prokaryote database contains 890 000 protein sequences organized into over 100 000 alignments, each described by a phylogenetic tree. An original homology group discovery tool assembles sets of related proteins from all versus all pairwise alignments. Multiple alignments for each homology group are stored and subjected to phylogenetic tree inference. A graphical web interface provides visual exploration of the GeneTrees database. Homology groups can be queried by sequence identifiers or annotation terms. Genomes can be browsed visually on a gene map of each chromosome or plasmid. Phylogenetic trees with support values are displayed in conjunction with the associated sequence alignment. A variety of classes of information can be selected to label the tree tips to aid in visual evaluation of annotation and gene function. This web interface is available at .
Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) are genetic elements whose products are essential to the process of disease development. They have been horizontally (laterally) transferred from other microbes and are important in evolution of pathogenesis. In this study, a comprehensive database and search engines specialized for PAIs were established. The pathogenicity island database (PAIDB) is a comprehensive relational database of all the reported PAIs and potential PAI regions which were predicted by a method that combines feature-based analysis and similarity-based analysis. Also, using the PAI Finder search application, a multi-sequence query can be analyzed onsite for the presence of potential PAIs. As of April 2006, PAIDB contains 112 types of PAIs and 889 GenBank accessions containing either partial or all PAI loci previously reported in the literature, which are present in 497 strains of pathogenic bacteria. The database also offers 310 candidate PAIs predicted from 118 sequenced prokaryotic genomes. With the increasing number of prokaryotic genomes without functional inference and sequenced genetic regions of suspected involvement in diseases, this web-based, user-friendly resource has the potential to be of significant use in pathogenomics. PAIDB is freely accessible at .
The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database () at the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, UK, offers a large and freely accessible collection of nucleotide sequences and accompanying annotation. The database is maintained in collaboration with DDBJ and GenBank. Data are exchanged between the collaborating databases on a daily basis to achieve optimal synchrony. Webin is the preferred tool for individual submissions of nucleotide sequences, including Third Party Annotation, alignments and bulk data. Automated procedures are provided for submissions from large-scale sequencing projects and data from the European Patent Office. In 2006, the volume of data has continued to grow exponentially. Access to the data is provided via SRS, ftp and variety of other methods. Extensive external and internal cross-references enable users to search for related information across other databases and within the database. All available resources can be accessed via the EBI home page at . Changes over the past year include changes to the file format, further development of the EMBLCDS dataset and developments to the XML format.
Transcriptional factors (TFs) and many of their target genes are involved in gene regulation at the level of transcription. To decipher gene regulatory networks (GRNs) we require a comprehensive and accurate knowledge of transcriptional regulatory elements. TRED () was designed as a resource for gene regulation and function studies. It collects mammalian cis- and trans-regulatory elements together with experimental evidence. All the regulatory elements were mapped on to the assembled genomes. In this new release, we included a total of 36 TF families involved in cancer. Accordingly, the number of target promoters and genes for TF families has increased dramatically. There are 11 660 target genes (7479 in human, 2691 in mouse and 1490 in rat) and 14 908 target promoters (10 225 in human, 2985 in mouse and 1698 in rat). Additionally, we constructed GRNs for each TF family by connecting the TF–target gene pairs. Such interaction data between TFs and their target genes will assist detailed functional studies and help to obtain a panoramic view of the GRNs for cancer research.
A synapse is the junction across which a nerve impulse passes from an axon terminal to a neuron, muscle cell or gland cell. The functions and building molecules of the synapse are essential to almost all neurobiological processes. To describe synaptic structures and functions, we have developed Synapse Ontology (SynO), a hierarchical representation that includes 177 terms with hundreds of synonyms and branches up to eight levels deep. associated 125 additional protein keywords and 109 InterPro domains with these SynO terms. Using a combination of automated keyword searches, domain searches and manual curation, we collected 14 000 non-redundant synapse-related proteins, including 3000 in human. We extensively annotated the proteins with information about sequence, structure, function, expression, pathways, interactions and disease associations and with hyperlinks to external databases. The data are stored and presented in the Synapse protein DataBase (SynDB, ). SynDB can be interactively browsed by SynO, Gene Ontology (GO), domain families, species, chromosomal locations or Tribe-MCL clusters. It can also be searched by text (including Boolean operators) or by sequence similarity. SynDB is the most comprehensive database to date for synaptic proteins.
T1DBase () [Smink et al. (2005) Nucleic Acids Res., 33, D544–D549; Burren et al. (2004) Hum. Genomics, 1, 98–109] is a public website and database that supports the type 1 diabetes (T1D) research community. T1DBase provides a consolidated T1D-oriented view of the complex data world that now confronts medical researchers and enables scientists to navigate from information they know to information that is new to them. Overview pages for genes and markers summarize information for these elements. The Gene Dossier summarizes information for a list of genes. GBrowse [Stein et al. (2002) Genome Res., 10, 1599–1610] displays genes and other features in their genomic context, and Cytoscape [Shannon et al. (2003) Genome Res., 13, 2498–2504] shows genes in the context of interacting proteins and genes. The Beta Cell Gene Atlas shows gene expression in β cells, islets, and related cell types and lines, and the Tissue Expression Viewer shows expression across other tissues. The Microarray Viewer shows expression from more than 20 array experiments. The Beta Cell Gene Expression Bank contains manually curated gene and pathway annotations for genes expressed in β cells. T1DMart is a query tool for markers and genotypes. PosterPages are ‘home pages’ about specific topics or datasets. The key challenge, now and in the future, is to provide powerful informatics capabilities to T1D scientists in a form they can use to enhance their research.
The Candida Genome Database (CGD, ) contains a curated collection of genomic information and community resources for researchers who are interested in the molecular biology of the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. With the recent release of a new assembly of the C.albicans genome, Assembly 20, C.albicans genomics has entered a new era. Although the C.albicans genome assembly continues to undergo refinement, multiple assemblies and gene nomenclatures will remain in widespread use by the research community. CGD has now taken on the responsibility of maintaining the most up-to-date version of the genome sequence by providing the data from this new assembly alongside the data from the previous assemblies, as well as any future corrections and refinements. In this database update, we describe the sequence information available for C.albicans, the sequence information contained in CGD, and the tools for sequence retrieval, analysis and comparison that CGD provides. CGD is freely accessible at  and CGD curators may be contacted by email at candida-curator@genome.stanford.edu.
There are abundance of transcripts that code for no particular protein and that remain functionally uncharacterized. Some of these transcripts may have novel functions while others might be junk transcripts. Unfortunately, the experimental validation of such transcripts to find functional non-coding RNA candidates is very costly. Therefore, our primary interest is to computationally mine candidate functional transcripts from a pool of uncharacterized transcripts. We introduce fRNAdb: a novel database service that hosts a large collection of non-coding transcripts including annotated/non-annotated sequences from the H-inv database, NONCODE and RNAdb. A set of computational analyses have been performed on the included sequences. These analyses include RNA secondary structure motif discovery, EST support evaluation, cis-regulatory element search, protein homology search, etc. fRNAdb provides an efficient interface to help users filter out particular transcripts under their own criteria to sort out functional RNA candidates. fRNAdb is available at 
The BRENDA (BRaunschweig ENzyme DAtabase) enzyme information system () is the largest publicly available enzyme information system worldwide. The major parts of its contents are manually extracted from primary literature. It is not restricted to specific groups of enzymes, but includes information on all identified enzymes irrespective of the enzyme's source. The range of data encompasses functional, structural, sequence, localisation, disease-related, isolation, stability information on enzyme and ligand-related data. Each single entry is linked to the enzyme source and to a literature reference. Recently the data repository was complemented by text-mining data in AMENDA (Automatic Mining of ENzyme DAta) and FRENDA (Full Reference ENzyme DAta). A genome browser, membrane protein prediction and full-text search capacities were added. The newly implemented web service provides instant access to the data for programmers via a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) interface. The BRENDA data can be downloaded in the form of a text file from the beginning of 2007.
TransportDB () is a comprehensive database resource of information on cytoplasmic membrane transporters and outer membrane channels in organisms whose complete genome sequences are available. The complete set of membrane transport systems and outer membrane channels of each organism are annotated based on a series of experimental and bioinformatic evidence and classified into different types and families according to their mode of transport, bioenergetics, molecular phylogeny and substrate specificities. User-friendly web interfaces are designed for easy access, query and download of the data. Features of the TransportDB website include text-based and BLAST search tools against known transporter and outer membrane channel proteins; comparison of transporter and outer membrane channel contents from different organisms; known 3D structures of transporters, and phylogenetic trees of transporter families. On individual protein pages, users can find detailed functional annotation, supporting bioinformatic evidence, protein/DNA sequences, publications and cross-referenced external online resource links. TransportDB has now been in existence for over 10 years and continues to be regularly updated with new evidence and data from newly sequenced genomes, as well as having new features added periodically.
Sentra (), a database of signal transduction proteins encoded in completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes, has been updated to reflect recent advances in understanding signal transduction events on a whole-genome scale. Sentra consists of two principal components, a manually curated list of signal transduction proteins in 202 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes and an automatically generated listing of predicted signaling proteins in 235 sequenced genomes that are awaiting manual curation. In addition to two-component histidine kinases and response regulators, the database now lists manually curated Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases and protein phosphatases, as well as adenylate and diguanylate cyclases and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases, as defined in several recent reviews. All entries in Sentra are extensively annotated with relevant information from public databases (e.g. UniProt, KEGG, PDB and NCBI). Sentra's infrastructure was redesigned to support interactive cross-genome comparisons of signal transduction capabilities of prokaryotic organisms from a taxonomic and phenotypic perspective and in the framework of signal transduction pathways from KEGG. Sentra leverages the PUMA2 system to support interactive analysis and annotation of signal transduction proteins by the users.
DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) () newly collected and released 12 927 184 entries or 13 787 688 598 bases in the period from July 2005 to June 2006. The released data contain honeybee expressed sequence tags (ESTs), re-examined and re-annotated complete genome data of Escherichia coli K-12 W3110, medaka WGS and human MGA. We also systematically evaluated and classified the genes in the complete bacterial genomes submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, ) that is composed of DDBJ, EMBL Bank and GenBank. The examination and classification selected 557 000 genes as reliable ones among all the bacterial genes predicted by us.
SNAPPI-DB, a high performance database of Structures, iNterfaces and Alignments of Protein–Protein Interactions, and its associated Java Application Programming Interface (API) is described. SNAPPI-DB contains structural data, down to the level of atom co-ordinates, for each structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) together with associated data including SCOP, CATH, Pfam, SWISSPROT, InterPro, GO terms, Protein Quaternary Structures (PQS) and secondary structure information. Domain–domain interactions are stored for multiple domain definitions and are classified by their Superfamily/Family pair and interaction interface. Each set of classified domain–domain interactions has an associated multiple structure alignment for each partner. The API facilitates data access via PDB entries, domains and domain–domain interactions. Rapid development, fast database access and the ability to perform advanced queries without the requirement for complex SQL statements are provided via an object oriented database and the Java Data Objects (JDO) API. SNAPPI-DB contains many features which are not available in other databases of structural protein–protein interactions. It has been applied in three studies on the properties of protein–protein interactions and is currently being employed to train a protein–protein interaction predictor and a functional residue predictor. The database, API and manual are available for download at: .
Signal transduction pathways control most cellular activities in living cells ranging from regulation of gene expression to fine-tuning enzymatic activity and controlling motile behavior in response to extracellular and intracellular signals. Because of their extreme sequence variability and extensive domain shuffling, signal transduction proteins are difficult to identify, and their current annotation in most leading databases is often incomplete or erroneous. To overcome this problem, we have developed the microbial signal transduction (MiST) database (), a comprehensive library of the signal transduction proteins from completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes. By searching for domain profiles that implicate a particular protein as participating in signal transduction, we have systematically identified 69 270 two- and one-component proteins in 365 bacterial and archaeal genomes. We have designed a user-friendly website to access and browse the predicted signal transduction proteins within various organisms. Further capabilities include gene/protein sequence retrieval, visualized domain architectures, interactive chromosomal views for exploring gene neighborhood, advanced querying options and cross-species comparison. Newly available, complete genomes are loaded into the database each month. MiST is the only comprehensive and up-to-date electronic catalog of the signaling machinery in microbial genomes.
The Plasmid Information Database (PlasmID; ) was developed as a community-based resource portal to facilitate search and request of plasmid clones shared with the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) DNA Resource Core. PlasmID serves as a central data repository and enables researchers to search the collection online using common gene names and identifiers, keywords, vector features, author names and PubMed IDs. As of October 2006, the repository contains >46 000 plasmids in 98 different vectors, including cloned cDNA and genomic fragments from 26 different species. Moreover, the clones include plasmid vectors useful for routine and cutting-edge techniques; functionally related sets of human cDNA clones; and genome-scale gene collections for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, Bacillus anthracis and Vibrio cholerae. Information about the plasmids has been fully annotated in adherence with a high-quality standard, and clone samples are stored as glycerol stocks in a state-of-the-art automated −80°C freezer storage system. Clone replication and distribution is highly automated to minimize human error. Infor-mation about vectors and plasmid clones, including downloadable maps and sequence data, is freely available online. Researchers interested in requesting clone samples or sharing their own plasmids with the repository can visit the PlasmID website for more information.
EPConDB () is a public web site that supports research in diabetes, pancreatic development and beta-cell function by providing information about genes expressed in cells of the pancreas. EPConDB displays expression profiles for individual genes and information about transcripts, promoter elements and transcription factor binding sites. Gene expression results are obtained from studies examining tissue expression, pancreatic development and growth, differentiation of insulin-producing cells, islet or beta-cell injury, and genetic models of impaired beta-cell function. The expression datasets are derived using different microarray platforms, including the BCBC PancChips and Affymetrix gene expression arrays. Other datasets include semi-quantitative RT–PCR and MPSS expression studies. For selected microarray studies, lists of differentially expressed genes, derived from PaGE analysis, are displayed on the site. EPConDB provides database queries and tools to examine the relationship between a gene, its transcriptional regulation, protein function and expression in pancreatic tissues.
The goal of the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is to identify all functional elements in the human genome. The pilot phase is for comparison of existing methods and for the development of new methods to rigorously analyze a defined 1% of the human genome sequence. Experimental datasets are focused on the origin of replication, DNase I hypersensitivity, chromatin immunoprecipitation, promoter function, gene structure, pseudogenes, non-protein-coding RNAs, transcribed RNAs, multiple sequence alignment and evolutionarily constrained elements. The ENCODE project at UCSC website () is the primary portal for the sequence-based data produced as part of the ENCODE project. In the pilot phase of the project, over 30 labs provided experimental results for a total of 56 browser tracks supported by 385 database tables. The site provides researchers with a number of tools that allow them to visualize and analyze the data as well as download data for local analyses. This paper describes the portal to the data, highlights the data that has been made available, and presents the tools that have been developed within the ENCODE project. Access to the data and types of interactive analysis that are possible are illustrated through supplemental examples.
The version 2.0 of Tractor_DB is now accessible at its three international mirrors: ,  and . This database contains a collection of computationally predicted Transcription Factors' binding sites in gamma-proteobacterial genomes. These data should aid researchers in the design of microarray experiments and the interpretation of their results. They should also facilitate studies of Comparative Genomics of the regulatory networks of this group of organisms. In this paper we describe the main improvements incorporated to the database in the past year and a half which include incorporating information on the regulatory networks of 13—increasing to 30—new gamma-proteobacteria and developing a new computational strategy to complement the putative sites identified by the original weight matrix-based approach. We have also added dynamically generated navigation tabs to the navigation interfaces. Moreover, we developed a new interface that allows users to directly retrieve information on the conservation of regulatory interactions in the 30 genomes included in the database by navigating a map that represents a core of the known Escherichia coli regulatory network.
The database of protein complexes (PROTCOM) is a compilation of known 3D structures of protein–protein complexes enriched with artificially created domain–domain structures using the available entries in the Protein Data Bank. The domain–domain structures are generated by parsing single chain structures into loosely connected domains and are important features of the database. The database () could be used for benchmarking purposes of the docking and other algorithms for predicting 3D structures of protein–protein complexes. The database can be utilized as a template database in the homology or threading methods for modeling the 3D structures of unknown protein–protein complexes. PROTCOM provides the scientific community with an integrated set of tools for browsing, searching, visualizing and downloading a pool of protein complexes. The user is given the option to select a subset of entries using a combination of up to 10 different criteria. As on July 2006 the database contains 1770 entries, each of which consists of the known 3D structures and additional relevant information that can be displayed either in text-only or in visual mode.
Computational modelling of mammalian cell cycle regulation is a challenging task, which requires comprehensive knowledge on many interrelated processes in the cell. We have developed a web-based integrated database on cell cycle regulation in mammals in normal and pathological states (Cyclonet database). It integrates data obtained by ‘omics’ sciences and chemoinformatics on the basis of systems biology approach. Cyclonet is a specialized resource, which enables researchers working in the field of anticancer drug discovery to analyze the wealth of currently available information in a systematic way. Cyclonet contains information on relevant genes and molecules; diagrams and models of cell cycle regulation and results of their simulation; microarray data on cell cycle and on various types of cancer, information on drug targets and their ligands, as well as extensive bibliography on modelling of cell cycle and cancer-related gene expression data. The Cyclonet database is also accessible through the BioUML workbench, which allows flexible querying, analyzing and editing the data by means of visual modelling. Cyclonet aims to predict promising anticancer targets and their agents by application of Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances. The Cyclonet database is available at .
SwissRegulon () is a database containing genome-wide annotations of regulatory sites in the intergenic regions of genomes. The regulatory site annotations are produced using a number of recently developed algorithms that operate on multiple alignments of orthologous intergenic regions from related genomes in combination with, whenever available, known sites from the literature, and ChIP-on-chip binding data. Currently SwissRegulon contains annotations for yeast and 17 prokaryotic genomes. The database provides information about the sequence, location, orientation, posterior probability and, whenever available, binding factor of each annotated site. To enable easy viewing of the regulatory site annotations in the context of other features annotated on the genomes, the sites are displayed using the GBrowse genome browser interface and can be queried based on any annotated genomic feature. The database can also be queried for regulons, i.e. sites bound by a common factor.
Knowledge of toxins, virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes is essential for bio-defense applications aimed at identifying ‘functional’ signatures for characterizing emerging or engineered pathogens. Whereas genetic signatures identify a pathogen, functional signatures identify what a pathogen is capable of. To facilitate rapid identification of sequences and characterization of genes for signature discovery, we have collected all publicly available (as of this writing), organized sequences representing known toxins, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance genes in one convenient database, which we believe will be of use to the bio-defense research community. MvirDB integrates DNA and protein sequence information from Tox-Prot, SCORPION, the PRINTS virulence factors, VFDB, TVFac, Islander, ARGO and a subset of VIDA. Entries in MvirDB are hyperlinked back to their original sources. A blast tool allows the user to blast against all DNA or protein sequences in MvirDB, and a browser tool allows the user to search the database to retrieve virulence factor descriptions, sequences, and classifications, and to download sequences of interest. MvirDB has an automated weekly update mechanism. Each protein sequence in MvirDB is annotated using our fully automated protein annotation system and is linked to that system's browser tool. MvirDB can be accessed at .
miRGen is an integrated database of (i) positional relationships between animal miRNAs and genomic annotation sets and (ii) animal miRNA targets according to combinations of widely used target prediction programs. A major goal of the database is the study of the relationship between miRNA genomic organization and miRNA function. This is made possible by three integrated and user friendly interfaces. The Genomics interface allows the user to explore where whole-genome collections of miRNAs are located with respect to UCSC genome browser annotation sets such as Known Genes, Refseq Genes, Genscan predicted genes, CpG islands and pseudogenes. These miRNAs are connected through the Targets interface to their experimentally supported target genes from TarBase, as well as computationally predicted target genes from optimized intersections and unions of several widely used mammalian target prediction programs. Finally, the Clusters interface provides predicted miRNA clusters at any given inter-miRNA distance and provides specific functional information on the targets of miRNAs within each cluster. All of these unique features of miRGen are designed to facilitate investigations into miRNA genomic organization, co-transcription and targeting. miRGen can be freely accessed at .
InterPro is an integrated resource for protein families, domains and functional sites, which integrates the following protein signature databases: PROSITE, PRINTS, ProDom, Pfam, SMART, TIGRFAMs, PIRSF, SUPERFAMILY, Gene3D and PANTHER. The latter two new member databases have been integrated since the last publication in this journal. There have been several new developments in InterPro, including an additional reading field, new database links, extensions to the web interface and additional match XML files. InterPro has always provided matches to UniProtKB proteins on the website and in the match XML file on the FTP site. Additional matches to proteins in UniParc (UniProt archive) are now available for download in the new match XML files only. The latest InterPro release (13.0) contains more than 13 000 entries, covering over 78% of all proteins in UniProtKB. The database is available for text- and sequence-based searches via a webserver (), and for download by anonymous FTP (). The InterProScan search tool is now also available via a web service at .
The variation resources within the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser include polymorphism data drawn from public collections and analyses of these data, along with their display in the context of other genomic annotations. Primary data from dbSNP is included for many organisms, with added information including genomic alleles and orthologous alleles for closely related organisms. Display filtering and coloring is available by variant type, functional class or other annotations. Annotation of potential errors is highlighted and a genomic alignment of the variant's flanking sequence is displayed. HapMap allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (LD) are available for each HapMap population, along with non-human primate alleles. The browsing and analysis tools, downloadable data files and links to documentation and other information can be found at .
Estrogen has a profound impact on human physiology affecting transcription of numerous genes. To decipher functional characteristics of estrogen responsive genes, we developed KnowledgeBase for Estrogen Responsive Genes (KBERG). Genes in KBERG were derived from Estrogen Responsive Gene Database (ERGDB) and were analyzed from multiple aspects. We explored the possible transcription regulation mechanism by capturing highly conserved promoter motifs across orthologous genes, using promoter regions that cover the range of [−1200, +500] relative to the transcription start sites. The motif detection is based on ab initio discovery of common cis-elements from the orthologous gene cluster from human, mouse and rat, thus reflecting a degree of promoter sequence preservation during evolution. The identified motifs are linked to transcription factor binding sites based on the TRANSFAC database. In addition, KBERG uses two established ontology systems, GO and eVOC, to associate genes with their function. Users may assess gene functionality through the description terms in GO. Alternatively, they can gain gene co-expression information through evidence from human EST libraries via eVOC. KBERG is a user-friendly system that provides links to other relevant resources such as ERGDB, UniGene, Entrez Gene, HomoloGene, GO, eVOC and GenBank, and thus offers a platform for functional exploration and potential annotation of genes responsive to estrogen. KBERG database can be accessed at .
The University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser Database contains, as of September 2006, sequence and annotation data for the genomes of 13 vertebrate and 19 invertebrate species. The Genome Browser displays a wide variety of annotations at all scales from the single nucleotide level up to a full chromosome and includes assembly data, genes and gene predictions, mRNA and EST alignments, and comparative genomics, regulation, expression and variation data. The database is optimized for fast interactive performance with web tools that provide powerful visualization and querying capabilities for mining the data. In the past year, 22 new assemblies and several new sets of human variation annotation have been released. New features include VisiGene, a fully integrated in situ hybridization image browser; phyloGif, for drawing evolutionary tree diagrams; a redesigned Custom Track feature; an expanded SNP annotation track; and many new display options. The Genome Browser, other tools, downloadable data files and links to documentation and other information can be found at .
The GeneSpeed database () is an online database and resource tool facilitating the detailed study of protein domain homology in the transcriptomes of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. The population schema for the GeneSpeed database takes advantage of HOWARD™ parallel cluster technology () and performs exhaustive tBLASTn searches covering all pre-assigned PFAM domain classes in all species (currently 7973 domain families) against the respective Unigene EST databases of the selected four transcriptomes. The resulting database provides a complete annotation of presumed protein domain presence for each Unigene cluster. To complement this domain annotation we have also performed a custom transcription factor-family curation of all Pfam domains, incorporated the Gene Ontology classifications for these domains as well as integrated the Novartis SymAtlas2 dataset for both human and mouse which provides rapid and easy access to tissue-based expression analysis. Consequently, the GeneSpeed database provides the user with the capability to browse or search the database by any of these specialized criteria as well as more traditional means (gene identifier, gene symbol, etc.), thereby enabling a supervised analysis of gene families through a top-down hierarchical basis defined by domain content, all directly linked to an optimized gene expression dataset.

Using a user-friendly web interface, genes can be searched by name, description, position, SNP ID or clone name. Several public databases are integrated, including gene information from Ensembl, protein features from Uniprot/SWISS-PROT, Pfam and DAS-CBS. Gene relationships are fetched from BIND, MINT, KEGG and are integrated with ortholog data from TreeFam to extend the current interaction networks. Integrated tools for primer-design and mis-splicing analysis have been developed to facilitate experimental analysis of individual genes with focus on their variation. Snap is available at  and at .
WormBook () is an open-access, online collection of original, peer-reviewed chapters on the biology of Caenorhabditis elegans and related nematodes. Since WormBook was launched in June 2005 with 12 chapters, it has grown to over 100 chapters, covering nearly every aspect of C.elegans research, from Cell Biology and Neurobiology to Evolution and Ecology. WormBook also serves as the text companion to WormBase, the C.elegans model organism database. Objects such as genes, proteins and cells are linked to the relevant pages in WormBase, providing easily accessible background information. Additionally, WormBook chapters contain links to other relevant topics in WormBook, and the in-text citations are linked to their abstracts in PubMed and full-text references, if available. Since WormBook is online, its chapters are able to contain movies and complex images that would not be possible in a print version. WormBook is designed to keep up with the rapid pace of discovery in the field of C.elegans research and continues to grow. WormBook represents a generic publishing infrastructure that is easily adaptable to other research communities to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge in the field.
The Animal Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) database (AnimalQTLdb) is designed to house all publicly available QTL data on livestock animal species from which researchers can easily locate and compare QTL within species. The database tools are also added to link the QTL data to other types of genomic information, such as radiation hybrid (RH) maps, finger printed contig (FPC) physical maps, linkage maps and comparative maps to the human genome, etc. Currently, this database contains data on 1287 pig, 630 cattle and 657 chicken QTL, which are dynamically linked to respective RH, FPC and human comparative maps. We plan to apply the tool to other animal species, and add more structural genome information for alignment, in an attempt to aid comparative structural genome studies ().
TIGRFAMs is a collection of protein family definitions built to aid in high-throughput annotation of specific protein functions. Each family is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM), where both cutoff scores and membership in the seed alignment are chosen so that the HMMs can classify numerous proteins according to their specific molecular functions. Most TIGRFAMs models describe ‘equivalog’ families, where both orthology and lateral gene transfer may be part of the evolutionary history, but where a single molecular function has been conserved. The Genome Properties system contains a queriable set of metabolic reconstructions, genome metrics and extractions of information from the scientific literature. Its genome-by-genome assertions of whether or not specific structures, pathways or systems are present provide high-level conceptual descriptions of genomic content. These assertions enable comparative genomics, provide a meaningful biological context to aid in manual annotation, support assignments of Gene Ontology (GO) biological process terms and help validate HMM-based predictions of protein function. The Genome Properties system is particularly useful as a generator of phylogenetic profiles, through which new protein family functions may be discovered. The TIGRFAMs and Genome Properties systems can be accessed at  and .
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a powerful technology to map the protein composition of organelles, cell types and tissues. In our department, a large-scale effort to map these proteomes is complemented by the Max-Planck Unified (MAPU) proteome database. MAPU contains several body fluid proteomes; including plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Cell lines have been mapped to a depth of several thousand proteins and the red blood cell proteome has also been analyzed in depth. The liver proteome is represented with 3200 proteins. By employing high resolution MS and stringent validation criteria, false positive identification rates in MAPU are lower than 1:1000. Thus MAPU datasets can serve as reference proteomes in biomarker discovery. MAPU contains the peptides identifying each protein, measured masses, scores and intensities and is freely available at  using a clickable interface of cell or body parts. Proteome data can be queried across proteomes by protein name, accession number, sequence similarity, peptide sequence and annotation information. More than 4500 mouse and 2500 human proteins have already been identified in at least one proteome. Basic annotation information and links to other public databases are provided in MAPU and we plan to add further analysis tools.
The Human-transcriptome DataBase for Alternative Splicing (H-DBAS) is a specialized database of alternatively spliced human transcripts. In this database, each of the alternative splicing (AS) variants corresponds to a completely sequenced and carefully annotated human full-length cDNA, one of those collected for the H-Invitational human-transcriptome annotation meeting. H-DBAS contains 38 664 representative alternative splicing variants (RASVs) in 11 744 loci, in total. The data is retrievable by various features of AS, which were annotated according to manual annotations, such as by patterns of ASs, consequently invoked alternations in the encoded amino acids and affected protein motifs, GO terms, predicted subcellular localization signals and transmembrane domains. The database also records recently identified very complex patterns of AS, in which two distinct genes seemed to be bridged, nested or degenerated (multiple CDS): in all three cases, completely unrelated proteins are encoded by a single locus. By using AS Viewer, each AS event can be analyzed in the context of full-length cDNAs, enabling the user's empirical understanding of the relation between AS event and the consequent alternations in the encoded amino acid sequences together with various kinds of affected protein motifs. H-DBAS is accessible at .
NCBI's reference sequence (RefSeq) database () is a curated non-redundant collection of sequences representing genomes, transcripts and proteins. The database includes 3774 organisms spanning prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses, and has records for 2 879 860 proteins (RefSeq release 19). RefSeq records integrate information from multiple sources, when additional data are available from those sources and therefore represent a current description of the sequence and its features. Annotations include coding regions, conserved domains, tRNAs, sequence tagged sites (STS), variation, references, gene and protein product names, and database cross-references. Sequence is reviewed and features are added using a combined approach of collaboration and other input from the scientific community, prediction, propagation from GenBank and curation by NCBI staff. The format of all RefSeq records is validated, and an increasing number of tests are being applied to evaluate the quality of sequence and annotation, especially in the context of complete genomic sequence.
Conformational energy maps of the glycosidic linkages are a valuable resource to gain information about preferred conformations and flexibility of carbohydrates. Here we present GlycoMapsDB, a new database containing more than 2500 calculated conformational maps for a variety of di- to pentasaccharide fragments contained in N- and O-glycans. Oligosaccharides representing branchpoints of N-glycans are included in the set of fragments, thus the influence of neighbouring residues is reflected in the conformational maps. During refinement of new crystal structures, maps contained in GlycoMapsDB can serve as a valuable resource to check whether the torsion values of a glycosidic linkage are located in an ‘allowed’ region similar to the Ramachandran plot analysis for proteins. This might help to improve the structural quality of the glycan data contained in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). A link between GlycoMapsDB and the PDB has been established so that the glycosidic torsions of all glycans contained in the PDB can be retrieved and compared to calculated data. The service is available at .
Although a large amount of experimentally derived information about RNA editing sites currently exists, this information has remained scattered in a variety of sources and in diverse data formats. Availability of standard collections for high-quality experimental data will be by of great help for systematic studying of RNA editing, especially for developing computational algorithm to predict RNA editing site. dbRES () is a public database of known RNA editing sites. All sites are manually curated from literature and GenBank annotations. dbRES version 1.1 contains 5437 RNA editing sites of 251 transcripts, covering 96 organisms across plant, metazoan, protozoa, fungi and virus. dbRES provides comprehensive annotations and data summaries, including (but not limited to) transcript sequences, RNA editing types, editing site locations, amino acid changes, organisms, subcellular organelles (if available), cited references, etc. A user-friendly web interface is developed to facilitate both retrieving data and online display of RNA edit site information.
The Molecular INTeraction database (MINT, ) aims at storing, in a structured format, information about molecular interactions (MIs) by extracting experimental details from work published in peer-reviewed journals. At present the MINT team focuses the curation work on physical interactions between proteins. Genetic or computationally inferred interactions are not included in the database. Over the past four years MINT has undergone extensive revision. The new version of MINT is based on a completely remodeled database structure, which offers more efficient data exploration and analysis, and is characterized by entries with a richer annotation. Over the past few years the number of curated physical interactions has soared to over 95 000. The whole dataset can be freely accessed online in both interactive and batch modes through web-based interfaces and an FTP server. MINT now includes, as an integrated addition, HomoMINT, a database of interactions between human proteins inferred from experiments with ortholog proteins in model organisms ().
xanthusBase () is the official model organism database (MOD) for the social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. In many respects, M.xanthus represents the pioneer model organism (MO) for studying the genetic, biochemical, and mechanistic basis of prokaryotic multicellularity, a topic that has garnered considerable attention due to the significance of biofilms in both basic and applied microbiology research. To facilitate its utility, the design of xanthusBase incorporates open-source software, leveraging the cumulative experience made available through the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project, MediaWiki (), and dictyBase (), to create a MOD that is both highly useful and easily navigable. In addition, we have incorporated a unique Wikipedia-style curation model which exploits the internet's inherent interactivity, thus enabling M.xanthus and other myxobacterial researchers to contribute directly toward the ongoing genome annotation.
Entrez Gene () is NCBI's database for gene-specific information. Entrez Gene includes records from genomes that have been completely sequenced, that have an active research community to contribute gene-specific information or that are scheduled for intense sequence analysis. The content of Entrez Gene represents the result of both curation and automated integration of data from NCBI's Reference Sequence project (RefSeq), from collaborating model organism databases and from other databases within NCBI. Records in Entrez Gene are assigned unique, stable and tracked integers as identifiers. The content (nomenclature, map location, gene products and their attributes, markers, phenotypes and links to citations, sequences, variation details, maps, expression, homologs, protein domains and external databases) is provided via interactive browsing through NCBI's Entrez system, via NCBI's Entrez programing utilities (E-Utilities), and for bulk transfer by ftp.
The FireDB database is a databank for functional information relating to proteins with known structures. It contains the most comprehensive and detailed repository of known functionally important residues, bringing together both ligand binding and catalytic residues in one site. The platform integrates biologically relevant data filtered from the close atomic contacts in Protein Data Bank crystal structures and reliably annotated catalytic residues from the Catalytic Site Atlas. The interface allows users to make queries by protein, ligand or keyword. Relevant biologically important residues are displayed in a simple and easy to read manner that allows users to assess binding site similarity across homologous proteins. Binding site residue variations can also be viewed with molecular visualization tools. The database is available at 
The PathoSystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) is one of eight Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases (NIAID) to create a data and analysis resource for selected NIAID priority pathogens, specifically proteobacteria of the genera Brucella, Rickettsia and Coxiella, and corona-, calici- and lyssaviruses and viruses associated with hepatitis A and E. The goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive bioinformatics resource for these pathogens, including consistently annotated genome, proteome and metabolic pathway data to facilitate research into counter-measures, including drugs, vaccines and diagnostics. The project's curation strategy has three prongs: ‘breadth first’ beginning with whole-genome and proteome curation using standardized protocols, a ‘targeted’ approach addressing the specific needs of researchers and an integrative strategy to leverage high-throughput experimental data (e.g. microarrays, proteomics) and literature. The PATRIC infrastructure consists of a relational database, analytical pipelines and a website which supports browsing, querying, data visualization and the ability to download raw and curated data in standard formats. At present, the site warehouses complete sequences for 17 bacterial and 332 viral genomes. The PATRIC website () will continually grow with the addition of data, analysis and functionality over the course of the project.
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome shows remarkable sequence variability, leading to the classification of at least six major genotypes, numerous subtypes and a myriad of quasispecies within a given host. A database allowing researchers to investigate the genetic and structural variability of all available HCV sequences is an essential tool for studies on the molecular virology and pathogenesis of hepatitis C as well as drug design and vaccine development. We describe here the European Hepatitis C Virus Database (euHCVdb, ), a collection of computer-annotated sequences based on reference genomes. The annotations include genome mapping of sequences, use of recommended nomenclature, subtyping as well as three-dimensional (3D) molecular models of proteins. A WWW interface has been developed to facilitate database searches and the export of data for sequence and structure analyses. As part of an international collaborative effort with the US and Japanese databases, the European HCV Database (euHCVdb) is mainly dedicated to HCV protein sequences, 3D structures and functional analyses.
To provide an integrated bioinformatics platform for a systems biology approach to the biology of pseudomonads in infection and biotechnology the database SYSTOMONAS (SYSTems biology of pseudOMONAS) was established. Besides our own experimental metabolome, proteome and transcriptome data, various additional predictions of cellular processes, such as gene-regulatory networks were stored. Reconstruction of metabolic networks in SYSTOMONAS was achieved via comparative genomics. Broad data integration is realized using SOAP interfaces for the well established databases BRENDA, KEGG and PRODORIC. Several tools for the analysis of stored data and for the visualization of the corresponding results are provided, enabling a quick understanding of metabolic pathways, genomic arrangements or promoter structures of interest. The focus of SYSTOMONAS is on pseudomonads and in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen. With this database we would like to encourage the Pseudomonas community to elucidate cellular processes of interest using an integrated systems biology strategy. The database is accessible at .
The recent explosion in protein data generated from both directed small-scale studies and large-scale proteomics efforts has greatly expanded the quantity of available protein information and has prompted the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; ) to enhance the depth and accessibility of protein annotations. In particular, we have expanded ongoing efforts to improve the integration of experimental information and sequence-based predictions and have redesigned the protein information web pages. A key feature of this redesign is the development of a GBrowse-derived interactive Proteome Browser customized to improve the visualization of sequence-based protein information. This Proteome Browser has enabled SGD to unify the display of hidden Markov model (HMM) domains, protein family HMMs, motifs, transmembrane regions, signal peptides, hydropathy plots and profile hits using several popular prediction algorithms. In addition, a physico-chemical properties page has been introduced to provide easy access to basic protein information. Improvements to the layout of the Protein Information page and integration of the Proteome Browser will facilitate the ongoing expansion of sequence-specific experimental information captured in SGD, including post-translational modifications and other user-defined annotations. Finally, SGD continues to improve upon the availability of genetic and physical interaction data in an ongoing collaboration with BioGRID by providing direct access to more than 82 000 manually-curated interactions.
HepSEQ is a repository for an extensive library of public health and molecular data relating to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection collected from international sources. It is hosted by the Centre for Infections, Health Protection Agency (HPA), England, United Kingdom. This repository has been developed as a web-enabled, quality-controlled database to act as a tool for surveillance, HBV case management and for research. The web front-end for the database system can be accessed from . The format of the database system allows for comprehensive molecular, clinical and epidemiological data to be deposited into a functional database, to search and manipulate the stored data and to extract and visualize the information on epidemiological, virological, clinical, nucleotide sequence and mutational aspects of HBV infection through web front-end. Specific tools, built into the database, can be utilized to analyse deposited data and provide information on HBV genotype, identify mutations with known clinical significance (e.g. vaccine escape, precore and antiviral-resistant mutations) and carry out sequence homology searches against other deposited strains. Further mechanisms are also in place to allow specific tailored searches of the database to be undertaken.
The Rat Genome Database (RGD, ) is one of the core resources for rat genomics and recent developments have focused on providing support for disease-based research using the rat model. Recognizing the importance of the rat as a disease model we have employed targeted curation strategies to curate genes, QTL and strain data for neurological and cardiovascular disease areas. This work has centered on rat but also includes data for mouse and human to create ‘disease portals’ that provide a unified view of the genes, QTL and strain models for these diseases across the three species. The disease curation efforts combined with normal curation activities have served to greatly increase the content of the database, particularly for biological information, including gene ontology, disease, pathway and phenotype ontology annotations. In addition to improving the features and database content, community outreach has been expanded to demonstrate how investigators can leverage the resources at RGD to facilitate their research and to elicit suggestions and needs for future developments. We have published a number of papers that provide additional information on the ontology annotations and the tools at RGD for data mining and analysis to better enable researchers to fully utilize the database.
The worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) is the international collaboration that manages the deposition, processing and distribution of the PDB archive. The online PDB archive is a repository for the coordinates and related information for more than 38 000 structures, including proteins, nucleic acids and large macromolecular complexes that have been determined using X-ray crystallography, NMR and electron microscopy techniques. The founding members of the wwPDB are RCSB PDB (USA), MSD-EBI (Europe) and PDBj (Japan) [H.M. Berman, K. Henrick and H. Nakamura (2003) Nature Struct. Biol., 10, 980]. The BMRB group (USA) joined the wwPDB in 2006. The mission of the wwPDB is to maintain a single archive of macromolecular structural data that are freely and publicly available to the global community. Additionally, the wwPDB provides a variety of services to a broad community of users. The wwPDB website at  provides information about services provided by the individual member organizations and about projects undertaken by the wwPDB.
RNAdb is a comprehensive database of mammalian non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). There is increasing recognition that ncRNAs play important regulatory roles in multicellular organisms, and there is an expanding rate of discovery of novel ncRNAs as well as an increasing allocation of function. In this update to RNAdb, we provide nucleotide sequences and annotations for tens of thousands of non-housekeeping ncRNAs, including a wide range of mammalian microRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs and larger mRNA-like ncRNAs. Some of these have documented functions and/or expression patterns, but the majority remain of unclear significance, and include PIWI-interacting RNAs, ncRNAs identified from the latest rounds of large-scale cDNA sequencing projects, putative antisense transcripts, as well as ncRNAs predicted on the basis of structural features and alignments. Improvements to the database comprise not only new and updated ncRNA datasets, but also provision of microarray-based expression data and closer interface with more specialized ncRNA resources such as miRBase and snoRNA-LBME-db. To access RNAdb, visit .
Knowledge of protein localisation contributes towards our understanding of protein function and of biological inter-relationships. A variety of experimental methods are currently being used to produce localisation data that need to be made accessible in an integrated manner. Chimeric fluorescent fusion proteins have been used to define subcellular localisations with at least 1100 related experiments completed in Arabidopsis. More recently, many studies have employed mass spectrometry to undertake proteomic surveys of subcellular components in Arabidopsis yielding localisation information for ∼2600 proteins. Further protein localisation information may be obtained from other literature references to analysis of locations (AmiGO: ∼900 proteins), location information from Swiss-Prot annotations (∼2000 proteins); and location inferred from gene descriptions (∼2700 proteins). Additionally, an increasing volume of available software provides location prediction information for proteins based on amino acid sequence. We have undertaken to bring these various data sources together to build SUBA, a SUBcellular location database for Arabidopsis proteins. The localisation data in SUBA encompasses 10 distinct subcellular locations, >6743 non-redundant proteins and represents the proteins encoded in the transcripts responsible for 51% of Arabidopsis expressed sequence tags. The SUBA database provides a powerful means by which to assess protein subcellular localisation in Arabidopsis ().
Phenotypes are an important subject of biomedical research for which many repositories have already been created. Most of these databases are either dedicated to a single species or to a single disease of interest. With the advent of technologies to generate phenotypes in a high-throughput manner, not only is the volume of phenotype data growing fast but also the need to organize these data in more useful ways. We have created PhenomicDB (freely available at ), a multi-species genotype/phenotype database, which shows phenotypes associated with their corresponding genes and grouped by gene orthologies across a variety of species. We have enhanced PhenomicDB recently by additionally incorporating quantitative and descriptive RNA interference (RNAi) screening data, by enabling the usage of phenotype ontology terms and by providing information on assays and cell lines. We envision that integration of classical phenotypes with high-throughput data will bring new momentum and insights to our understanding. Modern analysis tools under development may help exploiting this wealth of information to transform it into knowledge and, eventually, into novel therapeutic approaches.
WormBase (), a model organism database for Caenorhabditis elegans and other related nematodes, continues to evolve and expand. Over the past year WormBase has added new data on C.elegans, including data on classical genetics, cell biology and functional genomics; expanded the annotation of closely related nematodes with a new genome browser for Caenorhabditis remanei; and deployed new hardware for stronger performance. Several existing datasets including phenotype descriptions and RNAi experiments have seen a large increase in new content. New datasets such as the C.remanei draft assembly and annotations, the Vancouver Fosmid library and TEC-RED 5′ end sites are now available as well. Access to and searching WormBase has become more dependable and flexible via multiple mirror sites and indexing through Google.
The TBestDB database contains ∼370 000 clustered expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences from 49 organisms, covering a taxonomically broad range of poorly studied, mainly unicellular eukaryotes, and includes experimental information, consensus sequences, gene annotations and metabolic pathway predictions. Most of these ESTs have been generated by the Protist EST Program, a collaboration among six Canadian research groups. EST sequences are read from trace files up to a minimum quality cut-off, vector and linker sequence is masked, and the ESTs are clustered using phrap. The resulting consensus sequences are automatically annotated by using the AutoFACT program. The datasets are automatically checked for clustering errors due to chimerism and potential cross-contamination between organisms, and suspect data are flagged in or removed from the database. Access to data deposited in TBestDB by individual users can be restricted to those users for a limited period. With this first report on TBestDB, we open the database to the research community for free processing, annotation, interspecies comparisons and GenBank submission of EST data generated in individual laboratories. For instructions on submission to TBestDB, contact tbestdb@bch.umontreal.ca. The database can be queried at .
Protein interaction data exists in a number of repositories. Each repository has its own data format, molecule identifier and supplementary information. Michigan Molecular Interactions (MiMI) assists scientists searching through this overwhelming amount of protein interaction data. MiMI gathers data from well-known protein interaction databases and deep-merges the information. Utilizing an identity function, molecules that may have different identifiers but represent the same real-world object are merged. Thus, MiMI allows the users to retrieve information from many different databases at once, highlighting complementary and contradictory information. To help scientists judge the usefulness of a piece of data, MiMI tracks the provenance of all data. Finally, a simple yet powerful user interface aids users in their queries, and frees them from the onerous task of knowing the data format or learning a query language. MiMI allows scientists to query all data, whether corroborative or contradictory, and specify which sources to utilize. MiMI is part of the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI) and is publicly available at: .
The Stanford Microarray Database (SMD; ) is a research tool and archive that allows hundreds of researchers worldwide to store, annotate, analyze and share data generated by microarray technology. SMD supports most major microarray platforms, and is MIAME-supportive and can export or import MAGE-ML. The primary mission of SMD is to be a research tool that supports researchers from the point of data generation to data publication and dissemination, but it also provides unrestricted access to analysis tools and public data from 300 publications. In addition to supporting ongoing research, SMD makes its source code fully and freely available to others under an Open Source license, enabling other groups to create a local installation of SMD. In this article, we describe several data analysis tools implemented in SMD and we discuss features of our software release.
We describe PReMod, a new database of genome-wide cis-regulatory module (CRM) predictions for both the human and the mouse genomes. The prediction algorithm, described previously in Blanchette et al. (2006) Genome Res., 16, 656–668, exploits the fact that many known CRMs are made of clusters of phylogenetically conserved and repeated transcription factors (TF) binding sites. Contrary to other existing databases, PReMod is not restricted to modules located proximal to genes, but in fact mostly contains distal predicted CRMs (pCRMs). Through its web interface, PReMod allows users to (i) identify pCRMs around a gene of interest; (ii) identify pCRMs that have binding sites for a given TF (or a set of TFs) or (iii) download the entire dataset for local analyses. Queries can also be refined by filtering for specific chromosomal regions, for specific regions relative to genes or for the presence of CpG islands. The output includes information about the binding sites predicted within the selected pCRMs, and a graphical display of their distribution within the pCRMs. It also provides a visual depiction of the chromosomal context of the selected pCRMs in terms of neighboring pCRMs and genes, all of which are linked to the UCSC Genome Browser and the NCBI. PReMod: .
With the increasing amount of structural data, the number of homologous protein structures bearing topological irregularities is steadily growing. These include proteins with circular permutations, segment-swapping, context-dependent folding or chameleon sequences that can adopt alternative secondary structures. Their non-trivial structural relationships are readily identified during expert analysis but their automatic identification using the existing computational tools still remains difficult or impossible. Such non-trivial cases of protein relationships are known to pose a problem to multiple alignment algorithms and to impede comparative modeling studies. They support a new emerging concept of evolutionary changeable protein fold, which creates practical difficulties for the hierarchical classifications of protein structures.To facilitate the understanding of, and to provide a comprehensive annotation of proteins with such non-trivial structural relationships we have created SISYPHUS ([Σισυϕος]—in Greek crafty), a compendium to the SCOP database. The SISYPHUS database contains a collection of manually curated structural alignments and their inter-relationships. The multiple alignments are constructed for protein structural regions that range from oligomeric biological units, or individual domains to fragments of different size. The SISYPHUS multiple alignments are displayed with SPICE, a browser that provides an integrated view of protein sequences, structures and their annotations. The database is available from .
Comparasite is a database for comparative studies of transcriptomes of parasites. In this database, each data is defined by the full-length cDNAs from various apicomplexan parasites. It integrates seven individual databases, Full-Parasites, consisting of numerous full-length cDNA clones that we have produced and sequenced: 12 484 cDNA sequences from Plasmodium falciparum, 11 262 from Plasmodium yoelii, 9633 from Plasmodium vivax, 1518 from Plasmodium berghei, 7400 from Toxoplasma gondii, 5921 from Cryptosporidium parvum and 10 966 from the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Putatively counterpart gene groups are clustered and comparative analysis of any combination of six apicomplexa species is implemented, such as interspecies comparisons regarding protein motifs (InterPro), predicted subcellular localization signals (PSORT), transmembrane regions (SOSUI) or upstream promoter elements. By specifying keywords and other search conditions, Comparasite retrieves putative counterpart gene groups containing a given feature in common or in a species-specific manner. By enabling multi-faceted comparative analyses of genes of apicomplexa protozoa, monophyletic organisms that have evolved to diversify to parasitize various hosts by adopting complex life cycles, Comparasite should help elucidate the mechanism behind parasitism. Our full-length cDNA databases and Comparasite are accessible from .
The LIPID MAPS Structure Database (LMSD) is a relational database encompassing structures and annotations of biologically relevant lipids. Structures of lipids in the database come from four sources: (i) LIPID MAPS Consortium's core laboratories and partners; (ii) lipids identified by LIPID MAPS experiments; (iii) computationally generated structures for appropriate lipid classes; (iv) biologically relevant lipids manually curated from LIPID BANK, LIPIDAT and other public sources. All the lipid structures in LMSD are drawn in a consistent fashion. In addition to a classification-based retrieval of lipids, users can search LMSD using either text-based or structure-based search options. The text-based search implementation supports data retrieval by any combination of these data fields: LIPID MAPS ID, systematic or common name, mass, formula, category, main class, and subclass data fields. The structure-based search, in conjunction with optional data fields, provides the capability to perform a substructure search or exact match for the structure drawn by the user. Search results, in addition to structure and annotations, also include relevant links to external databases. The LMSD is publicly available at 
ApiDB () represents a unified entry point for the NIH-funded Apicomplexan Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) that integrates numerous database resources and multiple data types. The phylum Apicomplexa comprises numerous veterinary and medically important parasitic protozoa including human pathogenic species of the genera Cryptosporidium, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma. ApiDB serves not only as a database in its own right, but as a single web-based point of entry that unifies access to three major existing individual organism databases (,  and CryptoDB.org), and integrates these databases with data available from additional sources. Through the ApiDB site, users may pose queries and search all available apicomplexan data and tools, or they may visit individual component organism databases.
The conserved domain database (CDD) is part of NCBI's Entrez database system and serves as a primary resource for the annotation of conserved domain footprints on protein sequences in Entrez. Entrez's global query interface can be accessed at  and will search CDD and many other databases. Domain annotation for proteins in Entrez has been pre-computed and is readily available in the form of ‘Conserved Domain’ links. Novel protein sequences can be scanned against CDD using the CD-Search service; this service searches databases of CDD-derived profile models with protein sequence queries using BLAST heuristics, at . Protein query sequences submitted to NCBI's protein BLAST search service are scanned for conserved domain signatures by default. The CDD collection contains models imported from Pfam, SMART and COG, as well as domain models curated at NCBI. NCBI curated models are organized into hierarchies of domains related by common descent. Here we report on the status of the curation effort and present a novel helper application, CDTree, which enables users of the CDD resource to examine curated hierarchies. More importantly, CDD and CDTree used in concert, serve as a powerful tool in protein classification, as they allow users to analyze protein sequences in the context of domain family hierarchies.
The Gene Expression Database (GXD) provides the scientific community with an extensive and easily searchable database of gene expression information about the mouse. Its primary emphasis is on developmental studies. By integrating different types of expression data, GXD aims to provide comprehensive information about expression patterns of transcripts and proteins in wild-type and mutant mice. Integration with the other Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) databases places the gene expression information in the context of genetic, sequence, functional and phenotypic information, enabling valuable insights into the molecular biology that underlies developmental and disease processes. In recent years the utility of GXD has been greatly enhanced by a large increase in data content, obtained from the literature and provided by researchers doing large-scale in situ and cDNA screens. In addition, we have continued to refine our query and display features to make it easier for users to interrogate the data. GXD is available through the MGI web site at  or directly at .
RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful tool to generate loss-of-function phenotypes in a variety of organisms. Combined with the sequence information of almost completely annotated genomes, RNAi technologies have opened new avenues to conduct systematic genetic screens for every annotated gene in the genome. As increasing large datasets of RNAi-induced phenotypes become available, an important challenge remains the systematic integration and annotation of functional information. Genome-wide RNAi screens have been performed both in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila for a variety of phenotypes and several RNAi libraries have become available to assess phenotypes for almost every gene in the genome. These screens were performed using different types of assays from visible phenotypes to focused transcriptional readouts and provide a rich data source for functional annotation across different species. The GenomeRNAi database provides access to published RNAi phenotypes obtained from cell-based screens and maps them to their genomic locus, including possible non-specific regions. The database also gives access to sequence information of RNAi probes used in various screens. It can be searched by phenotype, by gene, by RNAi probe or by sequence and is accessible at 
The RNA Editing Database (REDIdb) is an interactive, web-based database created and designed with the aim to allocate RNA editing events such as substitutions, insertions and deletions occurring in a wide range of organisms. The database contains both fully and partially sequenced DNA molecules for which editing information is available either by experimental inspection (in vitro) or by computational detection (in silico). Each record of REDIdb is organized in a specific flat-file containing a description of the main characteristics of the entry, a feature table with the editing events and related details and a sequence zone with both the genomic sequence and the corresponding edited transcript. REDIdb is a relational database in which the browsing and identification of editing sites has been simplified by means of two facilities to either graphically display genomic or cDNA sequences or to show the corresponding alignment. In both cases, all editing sites are highlighted in colour and their relative positions are detailed by mousing over. New editing positions can be directly submitted to REDIdb after a user-specific registration to obtain authorized secure access. This first version of REDIdb database stores 9964 editing events and can be freely queried at .
The HIV positive selection mutation database is a large-scale database available at  that provides detailed selection pressure maps of HIV protease and reverse transcriptase, both of which are molecular targets of antiretroviral therapy. This database makes available for the first time a very large HIV sequence dataset (sequences from ∼50 000 clinical AIDS samples, generously contributed by Specialty Laboratories, Inc.), which makes possible high-resolution selection pressure mapping. It provides information about not only the selection pressure on individual sites but also how selection pressure at one site is affected by mutations on other sites. It also includes datasets from other public databases, namely the Stanford HIV database [S. Y. Rhee, M. J. Gonzales, R. Kantor, B. J. Betts, J. Ravela and R. W. Shafer (2003) Nucleic Acids Res., 31, 298–303]. Comparison between these datasets in the database enables cross-validation with independent datasets and also specific evaluation of the effect of drug treatment.
The SUPERFAMILY database provides protein domain assignments, at the SCOP ‘superfamily’ level, for the predicted protein sequences in over 400 completed genomes. A superfamily groups together domains of different families which have a common evolutionary ancestor based on structural, functional and sequence data. SUPERFAMILY domain assignments are generated using an expert curated set of profile hidden Markov models. All models and structural assignments are available for browsing and download from . The web interface includes services such as domain architectures and alignment details for all protein assignments, searchable domain combinations, domain occurrence network visualization, detection of over- or under-represented superfamilies for a given genome by comparison with other genomes, assignment of manually submitted sequences and keyword searches. In this update we describe the SUPERFAMILY database and outline two major developments: (i) incorporation of family level assignments and (ii) a superfamily-level functional annotation. The SUPERFAMILY database can be used for general protein evolution and superfamily-specific studies, genomic annotation, and structural genomics target suggestion and assessment.
Protein Inter-atomic Distance Distributions (PIDD) is a dedicated database and structural bio-informatics system for distance based protein modeling. The database is developed to host and analyze the statistical data for protein inter-atomic distances based on their distributions in databases of known protein structures such as in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). PIDD is capable of generating, caching, and displaying the statistical distributions of the distances of various types and ranges. The collected information can be used to extract geometric restraints or mean-force potentials for protein structure determination including nuclear magnetic resonance structure determination and comparative model refinement. PIDD is supported with a friendly designed web interface so that users can easily specify the distance types and ranges, and retrieve, visualize or download the distributions of the distances as they desire. PIDD is freely accessible at 
The National Microbial Pathogen Data Resource (NMPDR) () is a National Institute of Allergy and Infections Disease (NIAID)-funded Bioinformatics Resource Center that supports research in selected Category B pathogens. NMPDR contains the complete genomes of ∼50 strains of pathogenic bacteria that are the focus of our curators, as well as >400 other genomes that provide a broad context for comparative analysis across the three phylogenetic Domains. NMPDR integrates complete, public genomes with expertly curated biological subsystems to provide the most consistent genome annotations. Subsystems are sets of functional roles related by a biologically meaningful organizing principle, which are built over large collections of genomes; they provide researchers with consistent functional assignments in a biologically structured context. Investigators can browse subsystems and reactions to develop accurate reconstructions of the metabolic networks of any sequenced organism. NMPDR provides a comprehensive bioinformatics platform, with tools and viewers for genome analysis. Results of precomputed gene clustering analyses can be retrieved in tabular or graphic format with one-click tools. NMPDR tools include Signature Genes, which finds the set of genes in common or that differentiates two groups of organisms. Essentiality data collated from genome-wide studies have been curated. Drug target identification and high-throughput, in silico, compound screening are in development.
TOPOFIT-DB (T-DB) is a public web-based database of protein structural alignments based on the TOPOFIT method, providing a comprehensive resource for comparative analysis of protein structure families. The TOPOFIT method is based on the discovery of a saturation point on the alignment curve (topomax point) which presents an ability to objectively identify a border between common and variable parts in a protein structural family, providing additional insight into protein comparison and functional annotation. TOPOFIT also effectively detects non-sequential relations between protein structures. T-DB provides users with the convenient ability to retrieve and analyze structural neighbors for a protein; do one-to-all calculation of a user provided structure against the entire current PDB release with T-Server, and pair-wise comparison using the TOPOFIT method through the T-Pair web page. All outputs are reported in various web-based tables and graphics, with automated viewing of the structure-sequence alignments in the Friend software package for complete, detailed analysis. T-DB presents researchers with the opportunity for comprehensive studies of the variability in proteins and is publicly available at .
The Mouse Phenome Database (MPD; ) is a repository of phenotypic and genotypic data on commonly used and genetically diverse inbred strains of mice. Strain characteristics data are contributed by members of the scientific community. Electronic access to centralized strain data enables biomedical researchers to choose appropriate strains for many systems-based research applications, including physiological studies, drug and toxicology testing and modeling disease processes. MPD provides a community data repository and a platform for data analysis and in silico hypothesis testing. The laboratory mouse is a premier genetic model for understanding human biology and pathology; MPD facilitates research that uses the mouse to identify and determine the function of genes participating in normal and disease pathways.
The Definitive Haplotype Database (D-HaploDB) is a web-accessible resource of genome-wide definitive haplotypes determined from a collection of Japanese complete hydatidiform moles (CHMs), each of which carries a genome derived from a single sperm. Currently, the database contains genotypes for 281 439 common SNPs from 74 CHMs which were determined by a high-throughput array-based oligonucleotide hybridization technique. The database also presents maps of haplotype blocks and linkage disequilibrium bins together with tagSNPs that might prove useful for association studies of disease genes. Cryptic relatedness among the samples in this study is unlikely, because the formation of a CHM is a maternal event of rare sporadic occurrence, and its genotype is that of the incoming sperm. This is demonstrated by the absence of long extended shared haplotypes (ESHs). The D-HaploDB is freely accessible via the Internet at 
ParameciumDB () is a new model organism database associated with the genome sequencing project of the unicellular eukaryote Paramecium tetraurelia. Built with the core components of the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project, ParameciumDB currently contains the genome sequence and annotations, linked to available genetic data including the Gif Paramecium stock collection. It is thus possible to navigate between sequences and stocks via the genes and alleles. Phenotypes, of mutant strains and of knockdowns obtained by RNA interference, are captured using controlled vocabularies according to the Entity-Attribute-Value model. ParameciumDB currently supports browsing of phenotypes, alleles and stocks as well as querying of sequence features (genes, UniProt matches, InterPro domains, Gene Ontology terms) and of genetic data (phenotypes, stocks, RNA interference experiments). Forms allow submission of RNA interference data and some bioinformatics services are available. Future ParameciumDB development plans include coordination of human curation of the near 40 000 gene models by members of the research community.
The recent development of microarray technology provided unprecedented opportunities to understand the genetic basis of aging. So far, many microarray studies have addressed aging-related expression patterns in multiple organisms and under different conditions. The number of relevant studies continues to increase rapidly. However, efficient exploitation of these vast data is frustrated by the lack of an integrated data mining platform or other unifying bioinformatic resource to enable convenient cross-laboratory searches of array signals. To facilitate the integrative analysis of microarray data on aging, we developed a web database and analysis platform ‘Gene Aging Nexus’ (GAN) that is freely accessible to the research community to query/analyze/visualize cross-platform and cross-species microarray data on aging. By providing the possibility of integrative microarray analysis, GAN should be useful in building the systems-biology understanding of aging. GAN is accessible at .
The NAR online Molecular Biology Database Collection is a public resource that contains links to the databases described in this issue of Nucleic Acids Research, previous NAR database issues, as well as a selection of other molecular biology databases that are freely available on the web and might be useful to the molecular biologist. The 2007 update includes 968 databases, 110 more than the previous one. Many databases that have been described in earlier issues of NAR come with updated summaries, which reflect recent progress and, in some instances, an expanded scope of these databases. The complete database list and summaries are available online on the Nucleic Acids Research web site .
Multi-locus and multi-species nucleotide diversity studies would benefit enormously from a public database encompassing high-quality haplotypic sequences with their associated genetic diversity measures. MamPol, ‘Mammalia Polymorphism Database’, is a website containing all the well-annotated polymorphic sequences available in GenBank for the Mammalia class grouped by name of organism and gene. Diversity measures of single nucleotide polymorphisms are provided for each set of haplotypic homologous sequences, including polymorphism at synonymous and non-synonymous sites, linkage disequilibrium and codon bias. Data gathering, calculation of diversity measures and daily updates are automatically performed using PDA software. The MamPol website includes several interfaces for browsing the contents of the database and making customizable comparative searches of different species or taxonomic groups. It also contains a set of tools for simple re-analysis of the available data and a statistics section that is updated daily and summarizes the contents of the database. MamPol is available at  and can be downloaded via FTP.
BindingDB () is a publicly accessible database currently containing ∼20 000 experimentally determined binding affinities of protein–ligand complexes, for 110 protein targets including isoforms and mutational variants, and ∼11 000 small molecule ligands. The data are extracted from the scientific literature, data collection focusing on proteins that are drug-targets or candidate drug-targets and for which structural data are present in the Protein Data Bank. The BindingDB website supports a range of query types, including searches by chemical structure, substructure and similarity; protein sequence; ligand and protein names; affinity ranges and molecular weight. Data sets generated by BindingDB queries can be downloaded in the form of annotated SDfiles for further analysis, or used as the basis for virtual screening of a compound database uploaded by the user. The data in BindingDB are linked both to structural data in the PDB via PDB IDs and chemical and sequence searches, and to the literature in PubMed via PubMed IDs.
VectorBase () is a web-accessible data repository for information about invertebrate vectors of human pathogens. VectorBase annotates and maintains vector genomes providing an integrated resource for the research community. Currently, VectorBase contains genome information for two organisms: Anopheles gambiae, a vector for the Plasmodium protozoan agent causing malaria, and Aedes aegypti, a vector for the flaviviral agents causing Yellow fever and Dengue fever.
Information on protein–protein interactions is still mostly limited to a small number of model organisms, and originates from a wide variety of experimental and computational techniques. The database and online resource STRING generalizes access to protein interaction data, by integrating known and predicted interactions from a variety of sources. The underlying infrastructure includes a consistent body of completely sequenced genomes and exhaustive orthology classifications, based on which interaction evidence is transferred between organisms. Although primarily developed for protein interaction analysis, the resource has also been successfully applied to comparative genomics, phylogenetics and network studies, which are all facilitated by programmatic access to the database backend and the availability of compact download files. As of release 7, STRING has almost doubled to 373 distinct organisms, and contains more than 1.5 million proteins for which associations have been pre-computed. Novel features include AJAX-based web-navigation, inclusion of additional resources such as BioGRID, and detailed protein domain annotation. STRING is available at 
CellCircuits () is an open-access database of molecular network models, designed to bridge the gap between databases of individual pairwise molecular interactions and databases of validated pathways. CellCircuits captures the output from an increasing number of approaches that screen molecular interaction networks to identify functional subnetworks, based on their correspondence with expression or phenotypic data, their internal structure or their conservation across species. This initial release catalogs 2019 computationally derived models drawn from 11 journal articles and spanning five organisms (yeast, worm, fly, Plasmodium falciparum and human). Models are available either as images or in machine-readable formats and can be queried by the names of proteins they contain or by their enriched biological functions. We envision CellCircuits as a clearinghouse in which theorists may distribute or revise models in need of validation and experimentalists may search for models or specific hypotheses relevant to their interests. We demonstrate how such a repository of network models is a novel systems biology resource by performing several meta-analyses not currently possible with existing databases.
Variable number tandem repeat-PCR (VNTR-PCR) is a novel method developed for molecular typing of microorganisms. This method has proven useful in epidemiological studies in medical microbiology. Although hundreds of bacterial genomes have been sequenced, variable number tandem repeats (TRs) derived from comparative genome analyses are scarce. This may hamper their application to the surveillance of bacteria in molecular epidemiology. Here, we present a freely accessible variable number tandem repeat database (VNTRDB) that is intended to be a resource for helping in the discovery of putatively polymorphic tandem repeat loci and to aid with assay design by providing the flanking sequences that can be used in subsequent PCR primer design. In order to reveal possible polymorphism, each TR locus was obtained by comparing the sequences between different sets of bacterial genera, species or strains. Through this comparison, TRs which are unique to a genus can also be identified. Moreover, a visualization tool is provided to ensure that the copy number and locus length of repeats are correct. The VNTRDB is available at .
The Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Database is a curated repository of information pertaining to the Hedgehog developmental pathway. It was designed to provide centralized access to a wide range of relevant information in an organism-agnostic manner. Data are provided for all genes and gene targets known to be involved in the Hh pathway across various organisms. The data provided include DNA and protein sequences as well as domain structure motifs. All known human diseases associated with the Hh pathway are indexed including experimental data on therapeutic agents and their molecular targets. Hh researchers will find useful information on relevant protocols, tissue cell lines and reagents used in current Hh research projects. Curated content is also provided for publications, grants and patents relating to the Hh pathway. The database can be accessed at .
We have developed the database, TMBETA-GENOME, for annotated β-barrel membrane proteins in genomic sequences using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. The statistical methods are based on amino acid composition, reside pair preference and motifs. In machine learning techniques, the combination of amino acid and dipeptide compositions has been used as main attributes. In addition, annotations have been made using the criterion based on the identification of β-barrel membrane proteins and exclusion of globular and transmembrane helical proteins. A web interface has been developed for identifying the annotated β-barrel membrane proteins in all known genomes. The users have the feasibility of selecting the genome from the three kingdoms of life, archaea, bacteria and eukaryote, and five different methods. Further, the statistics for all genomes have been provided along with the links to different algorithms and related databases. It is freely available at .
The mouse genome database (MGD, ), the international community database for mouse, provides access to extensive integrated data on the genetics, genomics and biology of the laboratory mouse. The mouse is an excellent and unique animal surrogate for studying normal development and disease processes in humans. Thus, MGD's primary goals are to facilitate the use of mouse models for studying human disease and enable the development of translational research hypotheses based on comparative genotype, phenotype and functional analyses. Core MGD data content includes gene characterization and functions, phenotype and disease model descriptions, DNA and protein sequence data, polymorphisms, gene mapping data and genome coordinates, and comparative gene data focused on mammals. Data are integrated from diverse sources, ranging from major resource centers to individual investigator laboratories and the scientific literature, using a combination of automated processes and expert human curation. MGD collaborates with the bioinformatics community on the development of data and semantic standards, and it incorporates key ontologies into the MGD annotation system, including the Gene Ontology (GO), the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, and the Anatomical Dictionary for Mouse Development and the Adult Anatomy. MGD is the authoritative source for mouse nomenclature for genes, alleles, and mouse strains, and for GO annotations to mouse genes. MGD provides a unique platform for data mining and hypothesis generation where one can express complex queries simultaneously addressing phenotypic effects, biochemical function and process, sub-cellular location, expression, sequence, polymorphism and mapping data. Both web-based querying and computational access to data are provided. Recent improvements in MGD described here include the incorporation of single nucleotide polymorphism data and search tools, the addition of PIR gene superfamily classifications, phenotype data for NIH-acquired knockout mice, images for mouse phenotypic genotypes, new functional graph displays of GO annotations, and new orthology displays including sequence information and graphic displays.
Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are reverse complementary at least in part to the sequences of other endogenous sense transcripts. Most NATs are transcribed from opposite strands of their sense partners. They regulate sense genes at multiple levels and are implicated in various diseases. Using an improved whole-genome computational pipeline, we identified abundant cis-encoded exon-overlapping sense–antisense (SA) gene pairs in human (7356), mouse (6806), fly (1554), and eight other eukaryotic species (total 6534). We developed NATsDB (Natural Antisense Transcripts DataBase, ) to enable efficient browsing, searching and downloading of this currently most comprehensive collection of SA genes, grouped into six classes based on their overlapping patterns. NATsDB also includes non-exon-overlapping bidirectional (NOB) genes and non-bidirectional (NBD) genes. To facilitate the study of functions, regulations and possible pathological implications, NATsDB includes extensive information about gene structures, poly(A) signals and tails, phastCons conservation, homologues in other species, repeat elements, expressed sequence tag (EST) expression profiles and OMIM disease association. NATsDB supports interactive graphical display of the alignment of all supporting EST and mRNA transcripts of the SA and NOB genes to the genomic loci. It supports advanced search by species, gene name, sequence accession number, chromosome location, coding potential, OMIM association and sequence similarity.
Genome Information Broker for Viruses (GIB-V) is a comprehensive virus genome/segment database. We extracted 18 418 complete virus genomes/segments from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, ) by DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), EMBL and GenBank and stored them in our system. The list of registered viruses is arranged hierarchically according to taxonomy. Keyword searches can be performed for genome/segment data or biological features of any virus stored in GIB-V. GIB-V is equipped with a BLAST search function, and search results are displayed graphically or in list form. Moreover, the BLAST results can be used online with the ClustalW feature of the DDBJ. All available virus genome/segment data can be collected by the GIB-V download function. GIB-V can be accessed at no charge at .
Beyond the well-known role of proteolytic machinery in protein degradation and turnover, many specialized proteases play a key role in various regulatory processes. Thousands of highly specific proteolytic events are associated with normal and pathological conditions, including bacterial and viral infections. However, the information about individual proteolytic events is dispersed over multiple publications and is not easily available for large-scale analysis. CutDB is one of the first systematic efforts to build an easily accessible collection of documented proteolytic events for natural proteins in vivo or in vitro. A CutDB entry is defined by a unique combination of these three attributes: protease, protein substrate and cleavage site. Currently, CutDB integrates 3070 proteolytic events for 470 different proteases captured from public archives (such as MEROPS and HPRD) and publications. CutDB supports various types of data searches and displays, including clickable network diagrams. Most importantly, CutDB is a community annotation resource based on a Wikipedia approach, providing a convenient user interface to input new data online. A recent contribution of 568 proteolytic events by several experts in the field of matrix metallopeptidases suggests that this approach will significantly accelerate the development of CutDB content. CutDB is publicly available at .
The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) archives and freely disseminates microarray and other forms of high-throughput data generated by the scientific community. The database has a minimum information about a microarray experiment (MIAME)-compliant infrastructure that captures fully annotated raw and processed data. Several data deposit options and formats are supported, including web forms, spreadsheets, XML and Simple Omnibus Format in Text (SOFT). In addition to data storage, a collection of user-friendly web-based interfaces and applications are available to help users effectively explore, visualize and download the thousands of experiments and tens of millions of gene expression patterns stored in GEO. This paper provides a summary of the GEO database structure and user facilities, and describes recent enhancements to database design, performance, submission format options, data query and retrieval utilities. GEO is accessible at 
ArrayExpress is a public database for high throughput functional genomics data. ArrayExpress consists of two parts—the ArrayExpress Repository, which is a MIAME supportive public archive of microarray data, and the ArrayExpress Data Warehouse, which is a database of gene expression profiles selected from the repository and consistently re-annotated. Archived experiments can be queried by experiment attributes, such as keywords, species, array platform, authors, journals or accession numbers. Gene expression profiles can be queried by gene names and properties, such as Gene Ontology terms and gene expression profiles can be visualized. ArrayExpress is a rapidly growing database, currently it contains data from >50 000 hybridizations and >1 500 000 individual expression profiles. ArrayExpress supports community standards, including MIAME, MAGE-ML and more recently the proposal for a spreadsheet based data exchange format: MAGE-TAB. Availability: .
The Mouse Tumor Biology (MTB) database provides access to data about endogenously arising tumors (both spontaneous and induced) in genetically defined mice (inbred, hybrid, mutant and genetically engineered mice). Data include information on the frequency and latency of mouse tumors, pathology reports and images, genomic changes occurring in the tumors, genetic (strain) background and literature or contributor citations. Data are curated from the primary literature or submitted directly from researchers. MTB is accessed via the Mouse Genome Informatics web site (). Integrated searches of MTB are enabled through use of multiple controlled vocabularies and by adherence to standardized nomenclature, when available. Recently MTB has been redesigned and its database infrastructure replaced with a robust relational database management system (RDMS). Web interface improvements include a new advanced query form and enhancements to already existing search capabilities. The Tumor Frequency Grid has been revised to enhance interactivity, providing an overview of reported tumor incidence across mouse strains and an entrée into the database. A new pathology data submission tool allows users to submit, edit and release data to the MTB system.
REBASE is a comprehensive database of information about restriction enzymes, DNA methyltransferases and related proteins involved in the biological process of restriction-modification. It contains fully referenced information about recognition and cleavage sites, isoschizomers, neoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. Experimentally characterized homing endonucleases are also included. All newly sequenced genomes are analyzed for the presence of putative restriction systems and these data are included within the REBASE. The contents or REBASE may be browsed from the web () and selected compilations can be downloaded by ftp (). Additionally, monthly updates can be requested via email.
Three independent databases of eukaryotic genome size information have been launched or re-released in updated form since 2005: the Plant DNA C-values Database (), the Animal Genome Size Database () and the Fungal Genome Size Database (). In total, these databases provide freely accessible genome size data for >10 000 species of eukaryotes assembled from more than 50 years' worth of literature. Such data are of significant importance to the genomics and broader scientific community as fundamental features of genome structure, for genomics-based comparative biodiversity studies, and as direct estimators of the cost of complete sequencing programs.
The noncoding RNA database (ncRNAdb) was created as a source of information on RNA molecules, which do not possess protein-coding capacity. It is now widely accepted that, in addition to constitutively expressed, housekeeping or infrastructural RNAs, there is a wide variety of RNAs participating in mechanisms involved in regulation of gene expression at all levels of transmission of genetic information from DNA to proteins. Noncoding RNAs' activities include chromatin structure remodeling, transcriptional and translational regulation of gene expression, modulation of protein function and regulation of subcellular distribution of RNAs as well as proteins. Noncoding transcripts have been identified in organisms belonging to all domains of life. Currently, the ncRNAdb contains >30 000 ncRNA sequences from Eukaryotes, Eubacteria and Archaea, but does not include housekeeping transcripts or microRNAs and snoRNAs for which more specialized databases are available. The contents of the database can be accessed via the WWW at .
Connecting genotype to phenotype is fundamental in biomedical research and in our understanding of disease. Phenomics—the large-scale quantitative phenotypic analysis of genotypes on a genome-wide scale—connects automated data generation with the development of novel tools for phenotype data integration, mining and visualization. Our yeast phenomics database PROPHECY is available at . Via phenotyping of 984 heterozygous diploids for all essential genes the genotypes analysed and presented in PROPHECY have been extended and now include all genes in the yeast genome. Further, phenotypic data from gene overexpression of 574 membrane spanning proteins has recently been included. To facilitate the interpretation of quantitative phenotypic data we have developed a new phenotype display option, the Comparative Growth Curve Display, where growth curve differences for a large number of mutants compared with the wild type are easily revealed. In addition, PROPHECY now offers a more informative and intuitive first-sight display of its phenotypic data via its new summary page. We have also extended the arsenal of data analysis tools to include dynamic visualization of phenotypes along individual chromosomes. PROPHECY is an initiative to enhance the growing field of phenome bioinformatics.
PANTHER is a freely available, comprehensive software system for relating protein sequence evolution to the evolution of specific protein functions and biological roles. Since 2005, there have been three main improvements to PANTHER. First, the sequences used to create evolutionary trees are carefully selected to provide coverage of phylogenetic as well as functional information. Second, PANTHER is now a member of the InterPro Consortium, and the PANTHER hidden markov Models (HMMs) are distributed as part of InterProScan. Third, we have dramatically expanded the number of pathways associated with subfamilies in PANTHER. Pathways provide a detailed, structured representation of protein function in the context of biological reaction networks. PANTHER pathways were generated using the emerging Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) standard using pathway network editing software called CellDesigner. The pathway collection currently contains ∼1500 reactions in 130 pathways, curated by expert biologists with authorship attribution. The curation environment is designed to be easy to use, and the number of pathways is growing steadily. Because the reaction participants are linked to subfamilies and corresponding HMMs, reactions can be inferred across numerous different organisms. The HMMs can be downloaded by FTP, and tools for analyzing data in the context of pathways and function ontologies are available at .
Protein classification by machine learning algorithms is now widely used in structural and functional annotation of proteins. The Protein Classification Benchmark collection () was created in order to provide standard datasets on which the performance of machine learning methods can be compared. It is primarily meant for method developers and users interested in comparing methods under standardized conditions. The collection contains datasets of sequences and structures, and each set is subdivided into positive/negative, training/test sets in several ways. There is a total of 6405 classification tasks, 3297 on protein sequences, 3095 on protein structures and 10 on protein coding regions in DNA. Typical tasks include the classification of structural domains in the SCOP and CATH databases based on their sequences or structures, as well as various functional and taxonomic classification problems. In the case of hierarchical classification schemes, the classification tasks can be defined at various levels of the hierarchy (such as classes, folds, superfamilies, etc.). For each dataset there are distance matrices available that contain all vs. all comparison of the data, based on various sequence or structure comparison methods, as well as a set of classification performance measures computed with various classifier algorithms.
We report a novel release of the GermOnline knowledgebase covering genes relevant for the cell cycle, gametogenesis and fertility. GermOnline was extended into a cross-species systems browser including information on DNA sequence annotation, gene expression and the function of gene products. The database covers eight model organisms and Homo sapiens, for which complete genome annotation data are available. The database is now built around a sophisticated genome browser (Ensembl), our own microarray information management and annotation system (MIMAS) used to extensively describe experimental data obtained with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChips) and a comprehensive system for online editing of database entries (MediaWiki). The RNA data include results from classical microarrays as well as tiling arrays that yield information on RNA expression levels, transcript start sites and lengths as well as exon composition. Members of the research community are solicited to help GermOnline curators keep database entries on genes and gene products complete and accurate. The database is accessible at .
The PEDANT genome database provides exhaustive annotation of 468 genomes by a broad set of bioinformatics algorithms. We describe recent developments of the PEDANT Web server. The all-new Graphical User Interface (GUI) implemented in Java™ allows for more efficient navigation of the genome data, extended search capabilities, user customization and export facilities. The DNA and Protein viewers have been made highly dynamic and customizable. We also provide Web Services to access the entire body of PEDANT data programmatically. Finally, we report on the application of association rule mining for automatic detection of potential annotation errors. PEDANT is freely accessible to academic users at .
The OncoDB.HCC () is based on physical maps of rodent and human genomes containing quantitative trait loci of rodent HCC models and various human HCC somatic aberrations including chromosomal data from loss of heterozygosity and comparative genome hybridization analyses, altered expression of genes from microarray and proteomic studies, and finally experimental data of published HCC genes. Comprehensive integration of HCC genomic aberration data avoids potential pitfalls of data inconsistency from single genomic approach and provides lines of evidence to reveal somatic aberrations from levels of DNA, RNA to protein. Twenty-nine of 30 (96.7%) novel HCC genes with significant altered expressions in compared between tumor and adjacent normal tissues were validated by RT–PCR in 45 pairs of HCC tissues and by matching expression profiles in 57 HCC patients of re-analyzed Stanford HCC microarray data. Comparative mapping of HCC loci in between human aberrant chromosomal regions and QTLs of rodent HCC models revealed 12 syntenic HCC regions with 2 loci effectively narrowed down to 2 Mb. Together, OncoDB.HCC graphically presents comprehensive HCC data integration, reveals important HCC genes and loci for positional cloning and functional studies, and discloses potential molecular targets for improving HCC diagnosis and therapy.
Comparative studies have been of invaluable importance to the understanding of evolutionary biology. The evolution of developmental programs can be studied in nematodes at a single cell resolution given their fixed cell lineage. We have established Pristionchus pacificus as a major satellite organism for evolutionary developmental biology relative to Caenorhabditis elegans, the model nematode. Online genomic information to support studies in this satellite system can be accessed at . Our web resource offers diverse content covering genome browsing, genetic and physical maps, similarity searches, a community platform and assembly details. Content will be continuously improved as we annotate the P.pacificus genome, and will be an indispensable resource for P.pacificus genomics.
Analysis of functional genomics (transcriptomics and proteomics) datasets is hindered in agricultural species because agricultural genome sequences have relatively poor structural and functional annotation. To facilitate systems biology in these species we have established the curated, web-accessible, public resource ‘AgBase’ (). We have improved the structural annotation of agriculturally important genomes by experimentally confirming the in vivo expression of electronically predicted proteins and by proteogenomic mapping. Proteogenomic data are available from the AgBase proteogenomics link. We contribute Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and we provide a two tier system of GO annotations for users. The ‘GO Consortium’ gene association file contains the most rigorous GO annotations based solely on experimental data. The ‘Community’ gene association file contains GO annotations based on expert community knowledge (annotations based directly from author statements and submitted annotations from the community) and annotations for predicted proteins. We have developed two tools for proteomics analysis and these are freely available on request. A suite of tools for analyzing functional genomics datasets using the GO is available online at the AgBase site. We encourage and publicly acknowledge GO annotations from researchers and provide an online mechanism for agricultural researchers to submit requests for GO annotations.
Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs) are named for their subcellular localization within nucleoli and Cajal bodies (conserved subnuclear organelles present in the nucleoplasm), respectively. They have been found to play important roles in rRNA, tRNA, snRNAs, and even mRNA modification and processing. All snoRNAs fall in two categories, box C/D snoRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs, according to their distinct sequence and secondary structure features. Box C/D snoRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs mainly function in guiding 2′-O-ribose methylation and pseudouridilation, respectively. ScaRNAs possess both box C/D snoRNA and box H/ACA snoRNA sequence motif features, but guide snRNA modifications that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Here we present a Web-based sno/scaRNA database, called sno/scaRNAbase, to facilitate the sno/scaRNA research in terms of providing a more comprehensive knowledge base. Covering 1979 records derived from 85 organisms for the first time, sno/scaRNAbase is not only dedicated to filling gaps between existing organism-specific sno/scaRNA databases that are focused on different sno/scaRNA aspects, but also provides sno/scaRNA scientists with an opportunity to adopt a unified nomenclature for sno/scaRNAs. Derived from a systematic literature curation and annotation effort, the sno/scaRNAbase provides an easy-to-use gateway to important sno/scaRNA features such as sequence motifs, possible functions, homologues, secondary structures, genomics organization, sno/scaRNA gene's chromosome location, and more. Approximate searches, in addition to accurate and straightforward searches, make the database search more flexible. A BLAST search engine is implemented to enable blast of query sequences against all sno/scaRNAbase sequences. Thus our sno/scaRNAbase serves as a more uniform and friendly platform for sno/scaRNA research. The database is free available at .
Many protein interactions are mediated by small protein modules binding to short linear peptides. DOMINO () is an open-access database comprising more than 3900 annotated experiments describing interactions mediated by protein-interaction domains. DOMINO can be searched with a versatile search tool and the interaction networks can be visualized with a convenient graphic display applet that explicitly identifies the domains/sites involved in the interactions.
Here we present the Synthetic Gene Database (SGDB): a relational database that houses sequences and associated experimental information on synthetic (artificially engineered) genes from all peer-reviewed studies published to date. At present, the database comprises information from more than 200 published experiments. This resource not only provides reference material to guide experimentalists in designing new genes that improve protein expression, but also offers a dataset for analysis by bioinformaticians who seek to test ideas regarding the underlying factors that influence gene expression. The SGDB was built under MySQL database management system. We also offer an XML schema for standardized data description of synthetic genes. Users can access the database at , or batch downloads all information through XML files. Moreover, users may visually compare the coding sequences of a synthetic gene and its natural counterpart with an integrated web tool at , and discuss questions, findings and related information on an associated e-forum at .
The CORG resource (Comparative Regulatory Genomics, ) provides extensive cross-species comparisons of promoter regions in particular and whole gene loci in general. Pairwise as well as multiple alignments of 10 vertebrate species form the key component of CORG. We implemented a rapid alignment approach based on weight matrix motif anchors to ensure efficient computation and biologically informative alignments. All CORG workbench components have been enhanced towards more flexibility and interactivity. Reference sequence based data presentation and analysis was put into the well-known and modular Generic Genome Browser framework. Herein, various plugins facilitate online data analysis and integration with static conservation data. Main emphasis was put on the design of a new JAVA WebStart application for comparative data display. Flexible data import and export options for standard formats complete the provided services.
RegTransBase is a manually curated database of regulatory interactions in prokaryotes that captures the knowledge in public scientific literature using a controlled vocabulary. Although several databases describing interactions between regulatory proteins and their binding sites are already being maintained, they either focus mostly on the model organisms Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis or are entirely computationally derived. RegTransBase describes a large number of regulatory interactions reported in many organisms and contains the following types of experimental data: the activation or repression of transcription by an identified direct regulator, determining the transcriptional regulatory function of a protein (or RNA) directly binding to DNA (RNA), mapping or prediction of a binding site for a regulatory protein and characterization of regulatory mutations. Currently, RegTransBase content is derived from about 3000 relevant articles describing over 7000 experiments in relation to 128 microbes. It contains data on the regulation of about 7500 genes and evidence for 6500 interactions with 650 regulators. RegTransBase also contains manually created position weight matrices (PWM) that can be used to identify candidate regulatory sites in over 60 species. RegTransBase is available at .
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in various biological processes by suppressing gene expression. A recent work has indicated that host miRNAs are also capable of regulating viral gene expression by targeting the virus genomes. To investigate regulatory relationships between host miRNAs and related viruses, we present a novel database, namely ViTa, to curate the known virus miRNA genes and the known/putative target sites of human, mice, rat and chicken miRNAs. Known miRNAs are obtained from miRBase. Virus data are collected and referred from ICTVdB, VBRC and VirGen. Experimentally validated miRNA targets on viruses were derived from literatures. Then, miRanda and TargetScan are utilized to predict miRNA targets within virus genomes. ViTa also provides the virus annotations, virus-infected tissues and tissue specificity of host miRNAs. This work also facilitates the comparisons between subtypes of viruses, such as influenza viruses, human liver viruses and the conserved regions between viruses. Both textual and graphical web interfaces are provided to facilitate the data retrieves in the ViTa database. The database is now freely available at .
BeetleBase () is an integrated resource for the Tribolium research community. The red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) is an important model organism for genetics, developmental biology, toxicology and comparative genomics, the genome of which has recently been sequenced. BeetleBase is constructed to integrate the genomic sequence data with information about genes, mutants, genetic markers, expressed sequence tags and publications. BeetleBase uses the Chado data model and software components developed by the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project. This strategy not only reduces the time required to develop the database query tools but also makes the data structure of BeetleBase compatible with that of other model organism databases. BeetleBase will be useful to the Tribolium research community for genome annotation as well as comparative genomics.
Gene Ontology (GO) has been widely used to infer functional significance associated with sets of genes in order to automate discoveries within large-scale genetic studies. A level in GO's direct acyclic graph structure is often assumed to be indicative of its terms' specificities, although other work has suggested this assumption does not hold. Unfortunately, quantitative analysis of biological functions based on nodes at the same level (as is common in gene enrichment analysis tools) can lead to incorrect conclusions as well as missed discoveries due to inefficient use of available information. This paper addresses these using an informational theoretic approach encoded in the GO Partition Database that guarantees to maximize information for gene enrichment analysis. The GO Partition Database was designed to feature ontology partitions with GO terms of similar specificity. The GO partitions comprise varying numbers of nodes and present relevant information theoretic statistics, so researchers can choose to analyze datasets at arbitrary levels of specificity. The GO Partition Database, featuring GO partition sets for functional analysis of genes from human and 10 other commonly studied organisms with a total of 131 972 genes, is available on the internet at: . The site also includes an online tutorial.
Pig Genomic Information System (PigGIS) is a web-based depository of pig (Sus scrofa) genomic learning mainly engineered for biomedical research to locate pig genes from their human homologs and position single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in different pig populations. It utilizes a variety of sequence data, including whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads and expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and achieves a successful mapping solution to the low-coverage genome problem. With the data presently available, we have identified a total of 15 700 pig consensus sequences covering 18.5 Mb of the homologous human exons. We have also recovered 18 700 SNPs and 20 800 unique 60mer oligonucleotide probes for future pig genome analyses. PigGIS can be freely accessed via the web at  and .
 To organize data resulting from the phenotypic characterization of a library of 30 000 T-DNA enhancer trap (ET) insertion lines of rice ( Oryza sativa L cv. Nipponbare), we developed the Oryza Tag Line (OTL) database ( http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/OryzaTagLine /). OTL structure facilitates forward genetic search for specific phenotypes, putatively resulting from gene disruption, and/or for GUSA or GFP reporter gene expression patterns, reflecting ET-mediated endogenous gene detection. In the latest version, OTL gathers the detailed morpho-physiological alterations observed during field evaluation and specific screens in a first set of 13 928 lines. Detection of GUS or GFP activity in specific organ/tissues in a subset of the library is also provided. Search in OTL can be achieved through trait ontology category, organ and/or developmental stage, keywords, expression of reporter gene in specific organ/tissue as well as line identification number. OTL now contains the description of 9721 mutant phenotypic traits observed in 2636 lines and 1234 GUS or GFP expression patterns. Each insertion line is documented through a generic passport data including production records, seed stocks and FST information. 8004 and 6101 of the 13 928 lines are characterized by at least one T-DNA and one Tos17 FST, respectively that OTL links to the rice genome browser OryGenesDB. 
 ARED Organism represents the expansion of the adenylate uridylate (AU)-rich element (ARE)-containing human mRNA database into the transcriptomes of mouse and rat. As a result, we performed quantitative assessment of ARE conservation in human, mouse and rat transcripts. We found that a significant proportion ( ∼ 25%) of human genes differ in their ARE patterns from mouse and rat transcripts. ARED-Integrated, another updated and expanded version of ARED, is a compilation of ARED versions 1.0 to 3.0 and updated version 4.0 that is devoted to human mRNAs. Thus, ARED-Integrated and ARED-Organism databases, both publicly available at http://brp.kfshrc.edu.sa/ARED , offer scientists a comprehensive view of AREs in the human transcriptome and the ability to study the comparative genomics of AREs in model organisms. This ultimately will help in inferring the biological consequences of ARE variation in these key animal models as opposed to humans, particularly, in relationships to the role of RNA stability in disease. 
 WormBase ( www.wormbase.org ) is the major publicly available database of information about Caenorhabditis elegans , an important system for basic biological and biomedical research. Derived from the initial ACeDB database of C. elegans genetic and sequence information, WormBase now includes the genomic, anatomical and functional information about C. elegans , other Caenorhabditis species and other nematodes. As such, it is a crucial resource not only for C. elegans biologists but the larger biomedical and bioinformatics communities. Coverage of core areas of C. elegans biology will allow the biomedical community to make full use of the results of intensive molecular genetic analysis and functional genomic studies of this organism. Improved search and display tools, wider cross-species comparisons and extended ontologies are some of the features that will help scientists extend their research and take advantage of other nematode species genome sequences. 
 Since the completion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequencing project in 1996, the genomes of over 80 fungal species have been sequenced or are currently being sequenced. Resulting data provide opportunities for studying and comparing fungal biology and evolution at the genome level. To support such studies, the Comparative Fungal Genomics Platform (CFGP; http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr ), a web-based multifunctional informatics workbench, was developed. The CFGP comprises three layers, including the basal layer, middleware and the user interface. The data warehouse in the basal layer contains standardized genome sequences of 65 fungal species. The middleware processes queries via six analysis tools, including BLAST, ClustalW, InterProScan, SignalP 3.0, PSORT II and a newly developed tool named BLASTMatrix. The BLASTMatrix permits the identification and visualization of genes homologous to a query across multiple species. The Data-driven User Interface (DUI) of the CFGP was built on a new concept of pre-collecting data and post-executing analysis instead of the ‘fill-in-the-form-and-press-SUBMIT’ user interfaces utilized by most bioinformatics sites. A tool termed Favorite, which supports the management of encapsulated sequence data and provides a personalized data repository to users, is another novel feature in the DUI. 
 Protein sequences are the most important source of evolutionary and functional information for new proteins. In order to facilitate the computationally intensive tasks of sequence analysis, the Similarity Matrix of Proteins (SIMAP) database aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset of the pre-calculated sequence similarity matrix and sequence-based features like InterPro domains for all proteins contained in the major public sequence databases. As of September 2007, SIMAP covers ∼17 million proteins and more than 6 million non-redundant sequences and provides a complete annotation based on InterPro 16. Novel features of SIMAP include a new, portlet-based web portal providing multiple, structured views on retrieved proteins and integration of protein clusters and a unique search method for similar domain architectures. Access to SIMAP is freely provided for academic use through the web portal for individuals at http://mips.gsf.de/simap/and through Web Services for programmatic access at http://mips.gsf.de/webservices/services/SimapService2.0?wsdl . 
 Xenbase ( www.xenbase.org ) is a model organism database integrating a diverse array of biological and genomic data on the frogs, Xenopus laevis and Xenopus ( Silurana ) tropicalis . Data is collected from other databases, high-throughput screens and the scientific literature and integrated into a number of database modules covering subjects such as community, literature, gene and genomic analysis. Gene pages are automatically assembled from data piped from the Entrez Gene, Gurdon Institute, JGI, Metazome, MGI, OMIM, PubMed, Unigene, Zfin, commercial suppliers and others. These data are then supplemented with in-house annotation. Xenbase has implemented the Gbrowse genome browser and also provides a BLAST service that allows users to specifically search either laevis or tropicalis DNA or protein targets. A table of Xenopus gene synonyms has been implemented and allows the genome, genes, publications and high-throughput gene expression data to be seamlessly integrated with other Xenopus data and to external database resources, making the wealth of developmental and functional data from the frog available to the broader research community. 
 Emerging evidence indicates the importance of G-quadruplex motifs as drug targets. [Stuart A. Borman, Ascent of quadruplexes—nucleic acid structures become promising drug targets. Chem. Eng. News , 2007; 85 , 12–17], which stems from the fact that these motifs are present in a surprising number of promoters wherein their role in controlling gene expression has been demonstrated for a few. We present a compendium of quadruplex motifs, with particular focus on their occurrence and conservation in promoters—QuadBase. It is composed of two parts (EuQuad and ProQuad). EuQuad gives information on quadruplex motifs present within 10 kb of transcription starts sites in 99 980 human, chimpanzee, rat and mouse genes. ProQuad contains quadruplex information of 146 prokaryotes. Apart from gene-specific searches for quadruplex motifs, QuadBase has a number of other modules. ‘Orthologs Analysis’ queries for conserved motifs across species based on a selected reference organism; ‘Pattern Search’ can be used to fetch specific motifs of interest from a selected organism using user-defined criteria for quadruplex motifs, i.e. stem, loop size, etc. ‘Pattern Finder’ tool can search for motifs in any given sequence. QuadBase is freely available to users from non-profit organization at http://quadbase.igib.res.in/ . 
 Functional similarity based on Gene Ontology (GO) annotation is used in diverse applications like gene clustering, gene expression data analysis, protein interaction prediction and evaluation. However, there exists no comprehensive resource of functional similarity values although such a database would facilitate the use of functional similarity measures in different applications. Here, we describe FunSimMat (Functional Similarity Matrix, http://funsimmat.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ ), a large new database that provides several different semantic similarity measures for GO terms. It offers various precomputed functional similarity values for proteins contained in UniProtKB and for protein families in Pfam and SMART. The web interface allows users to efficiently perform both semantic similarity searches with GO terms and functional similarity searches with proteins or protein families. All results can be downloaded in tab-delimited files for use with other tools. An additional XML–RPC interface gives automatic online access to FunSimMat for programs and remote services. 
 JASPAR is a popular open-access database for matrix models describing DNA-binding preferences for transcription factors and other DNA patterns. With its third major release, JASPAR has been expanded and equipped with additional functions aimed at both casual and power users. The heart of the JASPAR database—the JASPAR CORE sub-database—has increased by 12% in size, and three new specialized sub-databases have been added. New functions include clustering of matrix models by similarity, generation of random matrices by sampling from selected sets of existing models and a language-independent Web Service applications programming interface for matrix retrieval. JASPAR is available at http://jaspar.genereg.net . 
 Protein kinases control cellular responses by phosphorylating specific substrates. Recent proteome-wide mapping of protein phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry has discovered thousands of in vivo sites. Systematically assigning all 518 human kinases to all these sites is a challenging problem. The NetworKIN database ( http://networkin.info ) integrates consensus substrate motifs with context modelling for improved prediction of cellular kinase–substrate relations. Based on the latest human phosphoproteome from the Phospho.ELM and PhosphoSite databases, the resource offers insight into phosphorylation-modulated interaction networks. Here, we describe how NetworKIN can be used for both global and targeted molecular studies. Via the web interface users can query the database of precomputed kinase–substrate relations or obtain predictions on novel phosphoproteins. The database currently contains a predicted phosphorylation network with 20 224 site-specific interactions involving 3978 phosphoproteins and 73 human kinases from 20 families. 
 Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are, together with copy number variation, the primary source of variation in the human genome. SNPs are associated with altered response to drug treatment, susceptibility to disease and other phenotypic variation. Furthermore, during genetic screens for disease-associated mutations in groups of patients and control individuals, the distinction between disease causing mutation and polymorphism is often unclear. Annotation of the functional and structural implications of single nucleotide changes thus provides valuable information to interpret and guide experiments. The SNPeffect and PupaSuite databases are now synchronized to deliver annotations for both non-coding and coding SNP, as well as annotations for the SwissProt set of human disease mutations. In addition, SNPeffect now contains predictions of Tango2: an improved aggregation detector, and Waltz: a novel predictor of amyloid-forming sequences, as well as improved predictors for regions that are recognized by the Hsp70 family of chaperones. The new PupaSuite version incorporates predictions for SNPs in silencers and miRNAs including their targets, as well as additional methods for predicting SNPs in TFBSs and splice sites. Also predictions for mouse and rat genomes have been added. In addition, a PupaSuite web service has been developed to enable data access, programmatically. The combined database holds annotations for 4 965 073 regulatory as well as 133 505 coding human SNPs and 14 935 disease mutations, and phenotypic descriptions of 43 797 human proteins and is accessible via http://snpeffect.vib.be and http://pupasuite.bioinfo.cipf.es/ . 
 DIMA—the domain interaction map has evolved from a simple web server for domain phylogenetic profiling into an integrative prediction resource combining both experimental data on domain–domain interactions and predictions from two different algorithms. With this update, DIMA obtains greatly improved coverage at the level of genomes and domains as well as with respect to available prediction approaches. The domain phylogenetic profiling method now uses SIMAP as its backend for exhaustive domain hit coverage: 7038 Pfam domains were profiled over 460 completely sequenced genomes.Domain pair exclusion predictions were produced from 83 969 distinct protein–protein interactions obtained from IntAct resulting in 21 513 domain pairs with significant domain pair exclusion algorithm scores. Additional predictions applying the same algorithm to predicted protein interactions from STRING yielded 2378 high-confidence pairs. Experimental data comes from iPfam (3074) and 3did (3034 pairs), two databases identifying domain contacts in solved protein structures. Taken together, these two resources yielded 3653 distinct interacting domain pairs. DIMA is available at http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/dima . 
 PROCOGNATE is a database of protein cognate ligands for the domains in enzyme structures as described by CATH, SCOP and Pfam, and is available as an interactive website or a flat file. This article gives an overview of the database and its generation and presents a new website front end, as well as recent increased coverage in our dataset via inclusion of Pfam domains. We also describe navigation of the website and its features. The current version (1.3) of PROCOGNATE covers 4123, 4536, 5876 structures and 377, 326, 695 superfamilies/families in CATH, SCOP and Pfam, respectively. PROCOGNATE can be accessed at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/procognate/
 The recent SARS epidemic has boosted interest in the discovery of novel human and animal coronaviruses. By July 2007, more than 3000 coronavirus sequence records, including 264 complete genomes, are available in GenBank. The number of coronavirus species with complete genomes available has increased from 9 in 2003 to 25 in 2007, of which six, including coronavirus HKU1, bat SARS coronavirus, group 1 bat coronavirus HKU2, groups 2c and 2d coronaviruses, were sequenced by our laboratory. To overcome the problems we encountered in the existing databases during comparative sequence analysis, we built a comprehensive database, CoVDB ( http://covdb.microbiology.hku.hk ), of annotated coronavirus genes and genomes. CoVDB provides a convenient platform for rapid and accurate batch sequence retrieval, the cornerstone and bottleneck for comparative gene or genome analysis. Sequences can be directly downloaded from the website in FASTA format. CoVDB also provides detailed annotation of all coronavirus sequences using a standardized nomenclature system, and overcomes the problems of duplicated and identical sequences in other databases. For complete genomes, a single representative sequence for each species is available for comparative analysis such as phylogenetic studies. With the annotated sequences in CoVDB, more specific blast search results can be generated for efficient downstream analysis. 
 The Genomes On Line Database (GOLD) is a comprehensive resource that provides information on genome and metagenome projects worldwide. Complete and ongoing projects and their associated metadata can be accessed in GOLD through pre-computed lists and a search page. As of September 2007, GOLD contains information on more than 2900 sequencing projects, out of which 639 have been completed and their sequence data deposited in the public databases. GOLD continues to expand with the goal of providing metadata information related to the projects and the organisms/environments towards the Minimum Information about a Genome Sequence’ (MIGS) guideline. GOLD is available at http://www.genomesonline.org and has a mirror site at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Crete, Greece at http://gold.imbb.forth.gr/
 CandidaDB ( http://genodb.pasteur.fr/CandidaDB ) was established in 2002 to provide the first genomic database for the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans . The availability of an increasing number of fully or partially completed genome sequences of related fungal species has opened the path for comparative genomics and prompted us to migrate CandidaDB into a multi-genome database. The new version of CandidaDB houses the latest versions of the genomes of C. albicans strains SC5314 and WO-1 along with six genome sequences from species closely related to C. albicans that all belong to the CTG clade of Saccharomycotina—Candida tropicalis , Candida (Clavispora) lusitaniae , Candida (Pichia) guillermondii, Lodderomyces elongisporus , Debaryomyces hansenii, Pichia stipitis —and the reference Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. CandidaDB includes sequences coding for 54 170 proteins with annotations collected from other databases, enriched with illustrations of structural features and functional domains and data of comparative analyses. In order to take advantage of the integration of multiple genomes in a unique database, new tools using pre-calculated or user-defined comparisons have been implemented that allow rapid access to comparative analysis at the genomic scale. 
 The Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS-GSF, Neuherberg, Germany) combines automatic processing of large amounts of sequences with manual annotation of selected model genomes. Due to the massive growth of the available data, the depth of annotation varies widely between independent databases. Also, the criteria for the transfer of information from known to orthologous sequences are diverse. To cope with the task of global in-depth genome annotation has become unfeasible. Therefore, our efforts are dedicated to three levels of annotation: (i) the curation of selected genomes, in particular from fungal and plant taxa (e.g. CYGD, MNCDB, MatDB), (ii) the comprehensive, consistent, automatic annotation employing exhaustive methods for the computation of sequence similarities and sequence-related attributes as well as the classification of individual sequences (SIMAP, PEDANT and FunCat) and (iii) the compilation of manually curated databases for protein interactions based on scrutinized information from the literature to serve as an accepted set of reliable annotated interaction data (MPACT, MPPI, CORUM). All databases and tools described as well as the detailed descriptions of our projects can be accessed through the MIPS web server ( http://mips.gsf.de ). 
 The NONCODE database is an integrated knowledge database designed for the analysis of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Since NONCODE was first released 3 years ago, the number of known ncRNAs has grown rapidly, and there is growing recognition that ncRNAs play important regulatory roles in most organisms. In the updated version of NONCODE (NONCODE v2.0), the number of collected ncRNAs has reached 206 226, including a wide range of microRNAs, Piwi-interacting RNAs and mRNA-like ncRNAs. The improvements brought to the database include not only new and updated ncRNA data sets, but also an incorporation of BLAST alignment search service and access through our custom UCSC Genome Browser. NONCODE can be found under http://www.noncode.org or http://noncode.bioinfo.org.cn . 
 ToxoDB ( http://ToxoDB.org ) is a genome and functional genomic database for the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii . It incorporates the sequence and annotation of the T. gondii ME49 strain, as well as genome sequences for the GT1, VEG and RH (Chr Ia, Chr Ib) strains. Sequence information is integrated with various other genomic-scale data, including community annotation, ESTs, gene expression and proteomics data. ToxoDB has matured significantly since its initial release. Here we outline the numerous updates with respect to the data and increased functionality available on the website. 
 The KNOTTIN database provides standardized information on the small disulfide-rich proteins with a knotted topology called knottins or inhibitor cystine knots. Static pages present the essential historical or recent results about knottin discoveries, sequences, structures, syntheses, folding, functions, applications and bibliography. New tools, KNOTER3D and KNOTER1D, are provided to determine or predict if a user query (3D structure or sequence) is a knottin. These tools are now used to automate the database update. All knottin structures and sequences in the database are now standardized according to the knottin nomenclature based on loop lengths between knotted cysteines, and to the knottin numbering scheme. Therefore, the whole KNOTTIN database (sequences and structures) can now be searched using loop lengths, in addition to keyword and sequence (BLAST, HMMER) searches. Renumbered and structurally fitted knottin PDB files are available for download as well as renumbered sequences, sequence alignments and logos. The knottin numbering scheme is used for automatic drawing of standardized two-dimensional Colliers de Perles of any knottin structure or sequence in the database or provided by the user. The KNOTTIN database is available at http://knottin.cbs.cnrs.fr . 
 MicroRNAs have been found in various organisms and play essential roles in gene expression regulation of many critical cellular processes. Large-scale computational prediction of miRNAs has been conducted for many organisms using known genomic sequences; however, there has been no such effort for the thousands of known viral genomes. Some viruses utilize existing host cellular pathways for their own benefit. Furthermore, viruses are capable of encoding miRNAs and using them to repress host genes. Thus, identifying potential miRNAs in all viral genomes would be valuable to virologists who study virus–host interactions. Based on our previously reported hairpin secondary structure and feature selection filters, we have examined the 2266 available viral genome sequences for putative miRNA hairpins and identified 33 691 hairpin candidates in 1491 genomes. Evaluation of the system performance indicated that our discovery pipeline exhibited 84.4% sensitivity. We established an interface for users to query the predicted viral miRNA hairpins based on taxonomic classification, and a host target gene prediction service based on the RNAhybrid program and the 3′-UTR gene sequences of human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, rice and Arabidopsis. The viral miRNA prediction database (Vir-Mir) can be accessed via http://alk.ibms.sinica.edu.tw . 
 The Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB) was created to provide the genome sequence assembly of the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP), manually curated annotation of the sequence, and other genomics information that could be useful for comprehensive understanding of the rice biology. Since the last publication of the RAP-DB, the IRGSP genome has been revised and reassembled. In addition, a large number of rice-expressed sequence tags have been released, and functional genomics resources have been produced worldwide. Thus, we have thoroughly updated our genome annotation by manual curation of all the functional descriptions of rice genes. The latest version of the RAP-DB contains a variety of annotation data as follows: clone positions, structures and functions of 31 439 genes validated by cDNAs, RNA genes detected by massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) technology and sequence similarity, flanking sequences of mutant lines, transposable elements, etc. Other annotation data such as Gnomon can be displayed along with those of RAP for comparison. We have also developed a new keyword search system to allow the user to access useful information. The RAP-DB is available at: http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/ and http://rapdb.lab.nig.ac.jp/ . 
 The integrated microbial genomes (IMG) system is a data management, analysis and annotation platform for all publicly available genomes. IMG contains both draft and complete JGI microbial genomes integrated with all other publicly available genomes from all three domains of life, together with a large number of plasmids and viruses. IMG provides tools and viewers for analyzing and annotating genomes, genes and functions, individually or in a comparative context. Since its first release in 2005, IMG's data content and analytical capabilities have been constantly expanded through quarterly releases. IMG is provided by the DOE-Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and is available from http://img.jgi.doe.gov . 
 Affymetrix exon arrays aim to target every known and predicted exon in the human, mouse or rat genomes, and have reporters that extend beyond protein coding regions to other areas of the transcribed genome. This combination of increased coverage and precision is important because a substantial proportion of protein coding genes are predicted to be alternatively spliced, and because many non-coding genes are known also to be of biological significance. In order to fully exploit these arrays, it is necessary to associate each reporter on the array with the features of the genome it is targeting, and to relate these to gene and genome structure. X:Map is a genome annotation database that provides this information. Data can be browsed using a novel Google-maps based interface, and analysed and further visualized through an associated BioConductor package. The database can be found at http://xmap.picr.man.ac.uk . 
 The identification of orthologous genes forms the basis for most comparative genomics studies. Existing approaches either lack functional annotation of the identified orthologous groups, hampering the interpretation of subsequent results, or are manually annotated and thus lag behind the rapid sequencing of new genomes. Here we present the eggNOG database (‘evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups’), which contains orthologous groups constructed from Smith–Waterman alignments through identification of reciprocal best matches and triangular linkage clustering. Applying this procedure to 312 bacterial, 26 archaeal and 35 eukaryotic genomes yielded 43 582 course-grained orthologous groups of which 9724 are extended versions of those from the original COG/KOG database. We also constructed more fine-grained groups for selected subsets of organisms, such as the 19 914 mammalian orthologous groups. We automatically annotated our non-supervised orthologous groups with functional descriptions, which were derived by identifying common denominators for the genes based on their individual textual descriptions, annotated functional categories, and predicted protein domains. The orthologous groups in eggNOG contain 1 241 751 genes and provide at least a broad functional description for 77% of them. Users can query the resource for individual genes via a web interface or download the complete set of orthologous groups at http://eggnog.embl.de . 
 Microsatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or short tandem repeats (STRs), have extensively been exploited as molecular markers for diverse applications. Recently, their role in gene regulation and genome evolution has also been discussed widely. We have developed UgMicroSat db (Unigene MicroSatellite d ata b ase), a web-based relational database of microsatellites present in unigene sequences covering 80 genomes. UgMicroSat db allows microsatellite search using multiple parameters like microsatellite type (simple perfect, compound perfect and imperfect), repeat unit length (mono- to hexa-nucleotide), repeat number, microsatellite length and repeat sequence class. Microsatellites can also be retrieved by specifying EST, cDNA, CDS identity or by using Gene Index, GenBank, UniGene IDs. The database also provides information about trinucleotide repeats encoding various amino acids. Such codon repeats can be searched by specifying characteristics of coded amino acids like charge (basic, acidic or neutral), polarity (polar or non-polar), and their hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature. The nucleotide sequences of the target UniGenes are also provided to facilitate primer designing for PCR amplification of the desired microsatellite. UgMicroSat db is available at http://ipu.ac.in/usbt/UgMicroSatdb.htm . 
 Peptidases (proteolytic enzymes or proteases), their substrates and inhibitors are of great relevance to biology, medicine and biotechnology. The MEROPS database ( http://merops.sanger.ac.uk ) aims to fulfil the need for an integrated source of information about these. The organizational principle of the database is a hierarchical classification in which homologous sets of peptidases and protein inhibitors are grouped into protein species, which are grouped into families and in turn grouped into clans. Important additions to the database include newly written, concise text annotations for peptidase clans and the small molecule inhibitors that are outside the scope of the standard classification; displays to show peptidase specificity compiled from our collection of known substrate cleavages; tables of peptidase–inhibitor interactions; and dynamically generated alignments of representatives of each protein species at the family level. New ways to compare peptidase and inhibitor complements between any two organisms whose genomes have been completely sequenced, or between different strains or subspecies of the same organism, have been devised. 
 The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea is rapidly emerging as a model organism for the study of regeneration, tissue homeostasis and stem cell biology. The recent sequencing, assembly and annotation of its genome are expected to further buoy the biomedical importance of this organism. In order to make the extensive data associated with the genome sequence accessible to the biomedical and planarian communities, we have created the Schmidtea mediterranea Genome Database (SmedGD). SmedGD integrates in a single web-accessible portal all available data associated with the planarian genome, including predicted and annotated genes, ESTs, protein homologies, gene expression patterns and RNAi phenotypes. Moreover, SmedGD was designed using tools provided by the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project, thus making its data structure compatible with other model organism databases. Because of the unique phylogenetic position of planarians, SmedGD ( http://smedgd.neuro.utah.edu ) will prove useful not only to the planarian research community, but also to those engaged in developmental and evolutionary biology, comparative genomics, stem cell research and regeneration. 
 High throughput methods are increasingly being used to examine the functions and interactions of gene products on a genome-scale. These include systematic large-scale proteomic studies of protein complexes and protein–protein interaction networks, functional genomic studies examining patterns of gene expression and comparative genomics studies examining patterns of conservation. Since these datasets offer different yet highly complementary perspectives on cell behavior it is expected that integration of these datasets will lead to conceptual advances in our understanding of the fundamental design and evolutionary principles that underlie the organization and function of proteins within biochemical pathways. Here we present Bacteriome.org, a resource that combines locally generated interaction and evolutionary datasets with a previously generated knowledgebase, to provide an integrated view of the Escherichia coli interactome. Tools are provided which allow the user to select and visualize functional, evolutionary and structural relationships between groups of interacting proteins and to focus on genes of interest. Currently the database contains three interaction datasets: a functional dataset consisting of 3989 interactions between 1927 proteins; a ‘core’ high quality experimental dataset of 4863 interactions between 1100 proteins and an ‘extended’ experimental dataset of 9860 interactions between 2131 proteins. Bacteriome.org is available online at http://www.bacteriome.org . 
 The Shanghai RAPESEED Database (RAPESEED, http://rapeseed.plantsignal.cn/ ) was created to provide the solid platform for functional genomics studies of oilseed crops with the emphasis on seed development and fatty acid metabolism. The RAPESEED includes the resource of 8462 unique ESTs, of which 3526 clones are with full length cDNA; the expression profiles of 8095 genes and the Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE, 23 895 unique tags) and tag-to-gene data during seed development. In addition, a total of ∼ 14 700 M3 mutant populations were generated by ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis and related seed quality information was determined using the Foss NIR System. Further, the TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) platform was established based on the generated EMS mutant population. The relevant information was collected in RAPESEED database, which can be searched through keywords, nucleotide or protein sequences, or seed quality parameters, and downloaded. 
 The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a significant public health threat worldwide. The virus is highly variable and evolves rapidly, making it an elusive target for the immune system and for vaccine and drug design. Presently, ∼50 000 HCV sequences have been published. A central website that provides annotated sequences and analysis tools will be helpful to HCV scientists worldwide. The HCV sequence database collects and annotates sequence data, and provides them to the public via a website that contains a user-friendly search interface and a large number of sequence analysis tools, following the model of the highly regarded and widely used Los Alamos HIV database. The HCV website can be accessed via http://hcv.lanl.gov and http://hcv-db.org . 
 An increasing number of phylogenetic analyses are based on the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). They mainly use the fast evolving sequence for low-level analyses. When considering the highly conserved structure, the same marker could also be used for higher level phylogenies. Furthermore, structural features of the ITS2 allow distinguishing different species from each other. Despite its importance, the correct structure is only rarely found by standard RNA folding algorithms. To overcome this hindrance for a wider application of the ITS2, we have developed a homology modelling approach to predict the structure of RNA and present the results of modelling the ITS2 in the ITS2 Database. Here, we describe the database and the underlying algorithms which allowed us to predict the structure for 86 784 sequences, which is more than 55% of all GenBank entries concerning the ITS2. These are not equally distributed over all genera. There is a substantial amount of genera where the structure of nearly all sequences is predicted whereas for others no structure at all was found despite high sequence coverage. These genera might have evolved an ITS2 structure diverging from the standard one. The current version of the ITS2 Database can be accessed via http://its2.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de . 
 DDBJ ( http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp ) collected and released 1 880 115 entries or 1 134 086 245 bases in the period from July 2006 to June 2007. The released data contains the high-throughput cDNAs of cricket and high-quality draft genome of medaka among others. Our computer system has been upgraded since March 2007. Another new aspect is an efficient data retrieval tool that has recently been equipped and served at DDBJ. It is called All-round Retrieval for Sequence and Annotation, which enables the user to search for keywords also in the Feature/Qualifier of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration ( http://www.insdc.org/ ). We will also replace our home page with a more efficient one by the end of 2007. 
 The highly expressed genes database (HEG-DB) is a genomic database that includes the prediction of which genes are highly expressed in prokaryotic complete genomes under strong translational selection. The current version of the database contains general features for almost 200 genomes under translational selection, including the correspondence analysis of the relative synonymous codon usage for all genes, and the analysis of their highly expressed genes. For each genome, the database contains functional and positional information about the predicted group of highly expressed genes. This information can also be accessed using a search engine. Among other statistical parameters, the database also provides the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) for all of the genes using the codon usage of the highly expressed genes as a reference set. The ‘Pathway Tools Omics Viewer’ from the BioCyc database enables the metabolic capabilities of each genome to be explored, particularly those related to the group of highly expressed genes. The HEG-DB is freely available at http://genomes.urv.cat/HEG-DB . 
 The ChromDB website ( http://www.chromdb.org ) displays chromatin-associated proteins, including RNAi-associated proteins, for a broad range of organisms. Our primary focus is to display sets of highly curated plant genes predicted to encode proteins associated with chromatin remodeling. Our intent is to make this intensively curated sequence information available to the research and teaching communities in support of comparative analyses toward understanding the chromatin proteome in plants, especially in important crop species such as corn and rice. Model animal and fungal proteins are included in the database to facilitate a complete, comparative analysis of the chromatin proteome and to make the database applicable to all chromatin researchers and educators. Chromatin biology and chromatin remodeling are complex processes involving a multitude of proteins that regulate the dynamic changes in chromatin structure which either repress or activate transcription. We strive to organize ChromDB data in a straightforward and comparative manner to help users understand the complement of proteins involved in packaging DNA into chromatin. 
 The double helix is a conformation that genomic DNA usually assumes; under certain conditions, however, guanine-rich DNA sequences can form a four-stranded structure, G-quadruplex, which is found to play a role in regulating gene expression. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the G-quadruplex formed in the c-MYC promoter suppresses its transcriptional activity. Recent studies suggest that G-quadruplex motifs (GQMs) are enriched in human gene promoters. To facilitate the research of G-quadruplex, we have constructed Greglist, a database listing potentially G-quadruplex regulated genes. Greglist harbors genes that contain promoter GQMs from genomes of various species, including humans, mice, rats and chickens. Many important genes are found to contain previously unreported promoter GQMs, such as ATM, BAD, AKT1, LEPR, UCP1, APOE, DKK1, WT1, WEE1, WNT1 and CLOCK . Furthermore, we find that not only protein coding genes, 126 human microRNAs also contain promoter GQMs. Greglist therefore provides candidates for further studying G-quadruplex functions and is freely available at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/greglist . 
 The protein property prediction and testing database (PPT-DB) is a database housing nearly 30 carefully curated databases, each of which contains commonly predicted protein property information. These properties include both structural (i.e. secondary structure, contact order, disulfide pairing) and dynamic (i.e. order parameters, B-factors, folding rates) features that have been measured, derived or tabulated from a variety of sources. PPT-DB is designed to serve two purposes. First it is intended to serve as a centralized, up-to-date, freely downloadable and easily queried repository of predictable or ‘derived’ protein property data. In this role, PPT-DB can serve as a one-stop, fully standardized repository for developers to obtain the required training, testing and validation data needed for almost any kind of protein property prediction program they may wish to create. The second role that PPT-DB can play is as a tool for homology-based protein property prediction. Users may query PPT-DB with a sequence of interest and have a specific property predicted using a sequence similarity search against PPT-DB's extensive collection of proteins with known properties. PPT-DB exploits the well-known fact that protein structure and dynamic properties are highly conserved between homologous proteins. Predictions derived from PPT-DB's similarity searches are typically 85–95% correct (for categorical predictions, such as secondary structure) or exhibit correlations of >0.80 (for numeric predictions, such as accessible surface area). This performance is 10–20% better than what is typically obtained from standard ‘ ab initio ’ predictions. PPT-DB, its prediction utilities and all of its contents are available at http://www.pptdb.ca
 CyBase was originally developed as a database for backbone-cyclized proteins, providing search and display capabilities for sequence, structure and function data. Cyclic proteins are interesting because, compared to conventional proteins, they have increased stability and enhanced binding affinity and therefore can potentially be developed as protein drugs. The new CyBase release features a redesigned interface and internal architecture to improve user-interactivity, collates double the amount of data compared to the initial release, and hosts a novel suite of tools that are useful for the visualization, characterization and engineering of cyclic proteins. These tools comprise sequence/structure 2D representations, a summary of grafting and mutation studies of synthetic analogues, a study of N- to C-terminal distances in known protein structures and a structural modelling tool to predict the best linker length to cyclize a protein. These updates are useful because they have the potential to help accelerate the discovery of naturally occurring cyclic proteins and the engineering of cyclic protein drugs. The new release of CyBase is available at http://research1t.imb.uq.edu.au/cybase
 Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) is a freely available dictionary of molecular entities focused on ‘small’ chemical compounds. The molecular entities in question are either natural products or synthetic products used to intervene in the processes of living organisms. Genome-encoded macromolecules (nucleic acids, proteins and peptides derived from proteins by cleavage) are not as a rule included in ChEBI. In addition to molecular entities, ChEBI contains groups (parts of molecular entities) and classes of entities. ChEBI includes an ontological classification, whereby the relationships between molecular entities or classes of entities and their parents and/or children are specified. ChEBI is available online at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/
 The Functional Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (F-SNP) database integrates information obtained from 16 bioinformatics tools and databases about the functional effects of SNPs. These effects are predicted and indicated at the splicing, transcriptional, translational and post-translational level. As such, the database helps identify and focus on SNPs with potential deleterious effect to human health. In particular, users can retrieve SNPs that disrupt genomic regions known to be functional, including splice sites and transcriptional regulatory regions. Users can also identify non-synonymous SNPs that may have deleterious effects on protein structure or function, interfere with protein translation or impede post-translational modification. A web interface enables easy navigation for obtaining information through multiple starting points and exploration routes (e.g. starting from SNP identifier, genomic region, gene or target disease). The F-SNP database is available at http://compbio.cs.queensu.ca/F-SNP/ . 
 In addition to maintaining the GenBank(R) nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides analysis and retrieval resources for the data in GenBank and other biological data available through NCBI's web site. NCBI resources include Entrez, the Entrez Programming Utilities, My NCBI, PubMed, PubMed Central, Entrez Gene, the NCBI Taxonomy Browser, BLAST, BLAST Link, Electronic PCR, OrfFinder, Spidey, Splign, RefSeq, UniGene, HomoloGene, ProtEST, dbMHC, dbSNP, Cancer Chromosomes, Entrez Genome, Genome Project and related tools, the Trace, Assembly, and Short Read Archives, the Map Viewer, Model Maker, Evidence Viewer, Clusters of Orthologous Groups, Influenza Viral Resources, HIV-1/Human Protein Interaction Database, Gene Expression Omnibus, Entrez Probe, GENSAT, Database of Genotype and Phenotype, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals, the Molecular Modeling Database, the Conserved Domain Database, the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool and the PubChem suite of small molecule databases. Augmenting the web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets. These resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . 
 KEGG ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ) is a database of biological systems that integrates genomic, chemical and systemic functional information. KEGG provides a reference knowledge base for linking genomes to life through the process of PATHWAY mapping, which is to map, for example, a genomic or transcriptomic content of genes to KEGG reference pathways to infer systemic behaviors of the cell or the organism. In addition, KEGG provides a reference knowledge base for linking genomes to the environment, such as for the analysis of drug-target relationships, through the process of BRITE mapping. KEGG BRITE is an ontology database representing functional hierarchies of various biological objects, including molecules, cells, organisms, diseases and drugs, as well as relationships among them. KEGG PATHWAY is now supplemented with a new global map of metabolic pathways, which is essentially a combined map of about 120 existing pathway maps. In addition, smaller pathway modules are defined and stored in KEGG MODULE that also contains other functional units and complexes. The KEGG resource is being expanded to suit the needs for practical applications. KEGG DRUG contains all approved drugs in the US and Japan, and KEGG DISEASE is a new database linking disease genes, pathways, drugs and diagnostic markers. 
x BASE is a genome database aimed at helping laboratory-based bacteriologists make best use of bacterial genome sequence data, with a particular emphasis on comparative genomics. The latest version, x BASE 2.0 ( http://xbase.bham.ac.uk ), now provides comprehensive coverage of all bacterial genomes and features an updated modularized backend and an improved user interface, which includes a taxonomy browser and a powerful full-text search facility. 
 With the recent increase in the number of mammalian genomes being sequenced, large-scale genome scans for human-specific positive selection are now possible. Selection can be inferred through phylogenetic analysis by comparing the rates of silent and replacement substitution between related species. Maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of codon substitution models can be used to identify genes with an accelerated pattern of amino acid substitution on a particular lineage. However, the ML methods are computationally intensive and awkward to configure. We have created a database that contains the results of tests for positive selection along the human lineage in 13 721 genes with orthologs in the UCSC multispecies genome alignments. The Human PAML Browser is a resource through which researchers can search for a gene of interest or groups of genes by Gene Ontology category, and obtain coding sequence alignments for the gene and as well as results from tests of positive selection from the software package Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood. The Human PAML Browser is available at http://mendel.gene.cwru.edu/adamslab/pbrowser.py . 
 Transposed elements (TEs) are mobile genetic sequences. During the evolution of eukaryotes TEs were inserted into active protein-coding genes, affecting gene structure, expression and splicing patterns, and protein sequences. Genomic insertions of TEs also led to creation and expression of new functional non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs. We have constructed the TranspoGene database, which covers TEs located inside protein-coding genes of seven species: human, mouse, chicken, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode and sea squirt. TEs were classified according to location within the gene: proximal promoter TEs, exonized TEs (insertion within an intron that led to exon creation), exonic TEs (insertion into an existing exon) or intronic TEs. TranspoGene contains information regarding specific type and family of the TEs, genomic and mRNA location, sequence, supporting transcript accession and alignment to the TE consensus sequence. The database also contains host gene specific data: gene name, genomic location, Swiss-Prot and RefSeq accessions, diseases associated with the gene and splicing pattern. In addition, we created microTranspoGene: a database of human, mouse, zebrafish and nematode TE-derived microRNAs. The TranspoGene and microTranspoGene databases can be used by researchers interested in the effect of TE insertion on the eukaryotic transcriptome. Publicly available query interfaces to TranspoGene and microTranspoGene are available at http://transpogene.tau.ac.il/ and http://microtranspogene.tau.ac.il , respectively. The entire database can be downloaded as flat files. 
 The InParanoid eukaryotic ortholog database ( http://InParanoid.sbc.su.se/ ) has been updated to version 6 and is now based on 35 species. We collected all available ‘complete’ eukaryotic proteomes and Escherichia coli , and calculated ortholog groups for all 595 species pairs using the InParanoid program. This resulted in 2 642 187 pairwise ortholog groups in total. The orthology-based species relations are presented in an orthophylogram. InParanoid clusters contain one or more orthologs from each of the two species. Multiple orthologs in the same species, i.e. inparalogs, result from gene duplications after the species divergence. A new InParanoid website has been developed which is optimized for speed both for users and for updating the system. The XML output format has been improved for efficient processing of the InParanoid ortholog clusters. 
 The Plant Ontology Consortium (POC, http://www.plantontology.org ) is a collaborative effort among model plant genome databases and plant researchers that aims to create, maintain and facilitate the use of a controlled vocabulary (ontology) for plants. The ontology allows users to ascribe attributes of plant structure (anatomy and morphology) and developmental stages to data types, such as genes and phenotypes, to provide a semantic framework to make meaningful cross-species and database comparisons. The POC builds upon groundbreaking work by the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) by adopting and extending the GOC's principles, existing software and database structure. Over the past year, POC has added hundreds of ontology terms to associate with thousands of genes and gene products from Arabidopsis , rice and maize, which are available through a newly updated web-based browser ( http://www.plantontology.org/amigo/go.cgi ) for viewing, searching and querying. The Consortium has also implemented new functionalities to facilitate the application of PO in genomic research and updated the website to keep the contents current. In this report, we present a brief description of resources available from the website, changes to the interfaces, data updates, community activities and future enhancement. 
Phospho.ELM is a manually curated database of eukaryotic phosphorylation sites. The resource includes data collected from published literature as well as high-throughput data sets.
 ERIC, the Enteropathogen Resource Integration Center ( www.ericbrc.org ), is a new web portal serving as a rich source of information about enterobacteria on the NIAID established list of Select Agents related to biodefense—diarrheagenic Escherichia coli , Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pestis . More than 30 genomes have been completely sequenced, many more exist in draft form and additional projects are underway. These organisms are increasingly the focus of studies using high-throughput experimental technologies and computational approaches. This wealth of data provides unprecedented opportunities for understanding the workings of basic biological systems and discovery of novel targets for development of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. ERIC brings information together from disparate sources and supports data comparison across different organisms, analysis of varying data types and visualization of analyses in human and computer-readable formats. 
 Gene duplication is common in all three domains of life, especially in eukaryotic genomes. The duplicates provide new material for the action of evolutionary forces such as selection or genetic drift. Here we describe a sophisticated procedure to extract duplicated genes (paralogs) from 26 available eukaryotic genomes, to pre-calculate several evolutionary indexes (evolutionary rate, synonymous distance/clock, transition redundant exchange clock, etc.) based on the paralog family, and to identify block or segmental duplications (paralogons). We also constructed an internet-accessible Eukaryotic Paralog Group Database (EPGD; http://epgd.biosino.org/EPGD/ ). The database is gene-centered and organized by paralog family. It focuses on paralogs and evolutionary duplication events. The paralog families and paralogons can be searched by text or sequence, and are downloadable from the website as plain text files. The database will be very useful for both experimentalists and bioinformaticians interested in the study of duplication events or paralog families. 
 The Bacillus cereus group of bacteria is an important group including mammalian and insect pathogens, such as B. anthracis , the anthrax bacterium, B. thuringiensis , used as a biological pesticide and B. cereus , often involved in food poisoning incidents. To characterize the population structure and epidemiology of these bacteria, five separate multilocus sequence typing (MLST) schemes have been developed, which makes results difficult to compare. Therefore, we have developed a database that compiles and integrates MLST data from all five schemes for the B. cereus group, accessible at http://mlstoslo.uio.no/ . Supertree techniques were used to combine the phylogenetic information from analysis of all schemes and datasets, in order to produce an integrated view of the B. cereus group population. The database currently contains strain information and sequence data for 1029 isolates and 26 housekeeping gene fragments, which can be searched by keywords, MLST scheme, or sequence similarity. Supertrees can be browsed according to various criteria such as species, isolate source, or genetic distance, and subtrees containing strains of interest can be extracted. Besides analysis of the available data, the user has the possibility to enter her/his own sequences and compare them to the database and/or include them into the supertree reconstructions. 
 The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, http://arabidopsis.org ) is the model organism database for the fully sequenced and intensively studied model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . Data in TAIR is derived in large part from manual curation of the Arabidopsis research literature and direct submissions from the research community. New developments at TAIR include the addition of the GBrowse genome viewer to the TAIR site, a redesigned home page, navigation structure and portal pages to make the site more intuitive and easier to use, the launch of several TAIR web services and a new genome annotation release (TAIR7) in April 2007. A combination of manual and computational methods were used to generate this release, which contains 27 029 protein-coding genes, 3889 pseudogenes or transposable elements and 1123 ncRNAs (32 041 genes in all, 37 019 gene models). A total of 681 new genes and 1002 new splice variants were added. Overall, 10 098 loci (one-third of all loci from the previous TAIR6 release) were updated for the TAIR7 release. 
 ProtozoaDB ( http://www.biowebdb.org/protozoadb ) is being developed to initially host both genomics and post-genomics data from Plasmodium falciparum , Entamoeba histolytica , Trypanosoma brucei , T. cruzi and Leishmania major , but will hopefully host other protozoan species as more genomes are sequenced. It is based on the Genomics Unified Schema and offers a modern Web-based interface for user-friendly data visualization and exploration. This database is not intended to duplicate other similar efforts such as GeneDB, PlasmoDB, TcruziDB or even TDRtargets, but to be complementary by providing further analyses with emphasis on distant similarities (HMM-based) and phylogeny-based annotations including orthology analysis. ProtozoaDB will be progressively linked to the above-mentioned databases, focusing in performing a multi-source dynamic combination of information through advanced interoperable Web tools such as Web services. Also, to provide Web services will allow third-party software to retrieve and use data from ProtozoaDB in automated pipelines (workflows) or other interoperable Web technologies, promoting better information reuse and integration. We also expect ProtozoaDB to catalyze the development of local and regional bioinformatics capabilities (research and training), and therefore promote/enhance scientific advancement in developing countries. 
 The complete collection of evolutionary histories of all genes in a genome, also known as phylome, constitutes a valuable source of information. The reconstruction of phylomes has been previously prevented by large demands of time and computer power, but is now feasible thanks to recent developments in computers and algorithms. To provide a publicly available repository of complete phylomes that allows researchers to access and store large-scale phylogenomic analyses, we have developed PhylomeDB. PhylomeDB is a database of complete phylomes derived for different genomes within a specific taxonomic range. All phylomes in the database are built using a high-quality phylogenetic pipeline that includes evolutionary model testing and alignment trimming phases. For each genome, PhylomeDB provides the alignments, phylogentic trees and tree-based orthology predictions for every single encoded protein. The current version of PhylomeDB includes the phylomes of Human, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the bacterium Escherichia coli , comprising a total of 32 289 seed sequences with their corresponding alignments and 172 324 phylogenetic trees. PhylomeDB can be publicly accessed at http://phylomedb.bioinfo.cipf.es
 The identification and study of the cis -regulatory elements that control gene expression are important areas of biological research, but few resources exist to facilitate large-scale bioinformatics studies of cis -regulation in metazoan species. Drosophila melanogaster , with its well-annotated genome, exceptional resources for comparative genomics and long history of experimental studies of transcriptional regulation, represents the ideal system for regulatory bioinformatics. We have merged two existing Drosophila resources, the REDfly database of cis -regulatory modules and the FlyReg database of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), into a single integrated database containing extensive annotation of empirically validated cis -regulatory modules and their constituent binding sites. With the enhanced functionality made possible through this integration of TFBS data into REDfly, together with additional improvements to the REDfly infrastructure, we have constructed a one-stop portal for Drosophila cis -regulatory data that will serve as a powerful resource for both computational and experimental studies of transcriptional regulation. REDfly is freely accessible at http://redfly.ccr.buffalo.edu . 
 Biomarkers enable early diagnosis, guide molecularly targeted therapy and monitor the activity and therapeutic responses across a variety of diseases. Despite intensified interest and research, however, the overall rate of development of novel biomarkers has been falling. Moreover, no solution is yet available that efficiently retrieves and processes biomarker information pertaining to infectious diseases. Infectious Disease Biomarker Database (IDBD) is one of the first efforts to build an easily accessible and comprehensive literature-derived database covering known infectious disease biomarkers. IDBD is a community annotation database, utilizing collaborative Web 2.0 features, providing a convenient user interface to input and revise data online. It allows users to link infectious diseases or pathogens to protein, gene or carbohydrate biomarkers through the use of search tools. It supports various types of data searches and application tools to analyze sequence and structure features of potential and validated biomarkers. Currently, IDBD integrates 611 biomarkers for 66 infectious diseases and 70 pathogens. It is publicly accessible at http://biomarker.cdc.go.kr and http://biomarker.korea.ac.kr . 
 The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; http://www.yeastgenome.org/ ) collects and organizes biological information about the chromosomal features and gene products of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Although published data from traditional experimental methods are the primary sources of evidence supporting Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for a gene product, high-throughput experiments and computational predictions can also provide valuable insights in the absence of an extensive body of literature. Therefore, GO annotations available at SGD now include high-throughput data as well as computational predictions provided by the GO Annotation Project (GOA UniProt; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/ ). Because the annotation method used to assign GO annotations varies by data source, GO resources at SGD have been modified to distinguish data sources and annotation methods. In addition to providing information for genes that have not been experimentally characterized, GO annotations from independent sources can be compared to those made by SGD to help keep the literature-based GO annotations current. 
 MALISAM ( m anual ali gnments for s tructurally a nalogous m otifs) represents the first database containing pairs of structural analogs and their alignments. To find reliable analogs, we developed an approach based on three ideas. First, an insertion together with a part of the evolutionary core of one domain family (a hybrid motif) is analogous to a similar motif contained within the core of another domain family. Second, a motif at an interface, formed by secondary structural elements (SSEs) contributed by two or more domains or subunits contacting along that interface, is analogous to a similar motif present in the core of a single domain. Third, an artificial protein obtained through selection from random peptides or in sequence design experiments not biased by sequences of a particular homologous family, is analogous to a structurally similar natural protein. Each analogous pair is superimposed and aligned manually, as well as by several commonly used programs. Applications of this database may range from protein evolution studies, e.g. development of remote homology inference tools and discriminators between homologs and analogs, to protein-folding research, since in the absence of evolutionary reasons, similarity between proteins is caused by structural and folding constraints. The database is publicly available at http://prodata.swmed.edu/malisam . 
 The Nucleic Acids Research online Molecular Biology Database Collection is a public repository that lists more than 1000 databases described in this and previous Nucleic Acids Research annual database issues, as well as a selection of molecular biology databases described in other journals. All databases included in this Collection are freely available to the public. The 2008 update includes 1078 databases, 110 more than the previous one. The links to more than 80 databases have been updated and 25 obsolete databases have been removed from the list. The complete database list and summaries are available online at the Nucleic Acids Research web site, http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/ . 
 Medaka ( Oryzias latipes ) is a small egg-laying freshwater teleost native to East Asia that has become an excellent model system for developmental genetics and evolutionary biology. The draft medaka genome sequence (700 Mb) was reported in June 2007, and its substantial genomic resources have been opened to the public through the University of Tokyo Genome Browser Medaka (UTGB/medaka) database. This database provides basic genomic information, such as predicted genes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs), guanine/cytosine (GC) content, repeats and comparative genomics, as well as unique data resources including (i) 2473 genetic markers and experimentally confirmed PCR primers that amplify these markers, (ii) 142 414 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and 217 344 fosmid end sequences that amount to 15.0- and 11.1-fold clone coverage of the entire genome, respectively, and were used for draft genome assembly, (iii) 16 519 460 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 2 859 905 insertions/deletions detected between two medaka inbred strain genomes and (iv) 841 235 5′-end serial analyses of gene-expression (SAGE) tags that identified 344 266 transcription start sites on the genome. UTGB/medaka is available at: http://medaka.utgenome.org/
 The Vertebrate Genome Annotation (Vega) database ( http://vega.sanger.ac.uk ) was first made public in 2004 and has been designed to view manual annotation of human, mouse and zebrafish genomic sequences produced at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Since its initial release, the number of human annotated loci has more than doubled to close to 33 000 and now contains comprehensive annotation on 20 of the 24 human chromosomes, four whole mouse chromosomes and around 40% of the zebrafish Danio rerio genome. In addition, we offer manual annotation of a number of haplotype regions in mouse and human and regions of comparative interest in pig and dog that are unique to Vega. 
 The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) provides a stable, comprehensive, freely accessible, central resource on protein sequences and functional annotation. The UniProt Consortium is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Protein Information Resource (PIR) and the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB). The core activities include manual curation of protein sequences assisted by computational analysis, sequence archiving, development of a user-friendly UniProt website, and the provision of additional value-added information through cross-references to other databases. UniProt is comprised of four major components, each optimized for different uses: the UniProt Knowledgebase, the UniProt Reference Clusters, the UniProt Archive and the UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental Sequences database. UniProt is updated and distributed every three weeks, and can be accessed online for searches or download at http://www.uniprot.org . 
 The Gene Ontology (GO) project ( http://www.geneontology.org /) provides a set of structured, controlled vocabularies for community use in annotating genes, gene products and sequences (also see http://www.sequenceontology.org /). The ontologies have been extended and refined for several biological areas, and improvements to the structure of the ontologies have been implemented. To improve the quantity and quality of gene product annotations available from its public repository, the GO Consortium has launched a focused effort to provide comprehensive and detailed annotation of orthologous genes across a number of ‘reference’ genomes, including human and several key model organisms. Software developments include two releases of the ontology-editing tool OBO-Edit, and improvements to the AmiGO browser interface. 
 GenBank (R) is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for more than 260 000 named organisms, obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank staff upon receipt. Daily data exchange with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Nucleotide Sequence Database in Europe and the DNA Data Bank of Japan ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through NCBI's retrieval system, Entrez, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. To access GenBank and its related retrieval and analysis services, begin at the NCBI Homepage: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
 The Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) database ( http://www.thebiogrid.org ) was developed to house and distribute collections of protein and genetic interactions from major model organism species. BioGRID currently contains over 198 000 interactions from six different species, as derived from both high-throughput studies and conventional focused studies. Through comprehensive curation efforts, BioGRID now includes a virtually complete set of interactions reported to date in the primary literature for both the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . A number of new features have been added to the BioGRID including an improved user interface to display interactions based on different attributes, a mirror site and a dedicated interaction management system to coordinate curation across different locations. The BioGRID provides interaction data with monthly updates to Saccharomyces Genome Database, Flybase and Entrez Gene. Source code for the BioGRID and the linked Osprey network visualization system is now freely available without restriction. 
 A database of coexpressed gene sets can provide valuable information for a wide variety of experimental designs, such as targeting of genes for functional identification, gene regulation and/or protein–protein interactions. Coexpressed gene databases derived from publicly available GeneChip data are widely used in Arabidopsis research, but platforms that examine coexpression for higher mammals are rather limited. Therefore, we have constructed a new database, COXPRESdb ( co e xpres sed gene d ata b ase) ( http://coxpresdb.hgc.jp ), for coexpressed gene lists and networks in human and mouse. Coexpression data could be calculated for 19 777 and 21 036 genes in human and mouse, respectively, by using the GeneChip data in NCBI GEO. COXPRESdb enables analysis of the four types of coexpression networks: (i) highly coexpressed genes for every gene, (ii) genes with the same GO annotation, (iii) genes expressed in the same tissue and (iv) user-defined gene sets. When the networks became too big for the static picture on the web in GO networks or in tissue networks, we used Google Maps API to visualize them interactively. COXPRESdb also provides a view to compare the human and mouse coexpression patterns to estimate the conservation between the two species. 
 The BioHealthBase Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) ( http://www.biohealthbase.org ) is a public bioinformatics database and analysis resource for the study of specific biodefense and public health pathogens— Influenza virus, Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Microsporidia species and ricin toxin. The BioHealthBase serves as an extensive integrated repository of data imported from public databases, data derived from various computational algorithms and information curated from the scientific literature. The goal of the BioHealthBase is to facilitate the development of therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines by integrating all available data in the context of host–pathogen interactions, thus allowing researchers to understand the root causes of virulence and pathogenicity. Genome and protein annotations can be viewed either as formatted text or graphically through a genome browser. 3D visualization capabilities allow researchers to view proteins with key structural and functional features highlighted. Influenza virus host–pathogen interactions at the molecular/cellular and systemic levels are represented. Host immune response to influenza infection is conveyed through the display of experimentally determined antibody and T-cell epitopes curated from the scientific literature or as derived from computational predictions. At the molecular/cellular level, the BioHealthBase BRC has developed biological pathway representations relevant to influenza virus host–pathogen interaction in collaboration with the Reactome database ( http://www.reactome.org ). 
 DNA transposon piggyBac (PB) is a newly established mutagen for large-scale mutagenesis in mice. We have designed and implemented an integrated database system called PBmice (PB Mutagenesis Information CEnter) for storing, retrieving and displaying the information derived from PB insertions (INSERTs) in the mouse genome. This system is centered on INSERTs with information including their genomic locations and flanking genomic sequences, the expression levels of the hit genes, and the expression patterns of the trapped genes if a trapping vector was used. It also archives mouse phenotyping data linked to INSERTs, and allows users to conduct quick and advanced searches for genotypic and phenotypic information relevant to a particular or a set of INSERT(s). Sequence-based information can be cross-referenced with other genomic databases such as Ensembl, BLAST and GBrowse tools used in PBmice offer enhanced search and display for additional information relevant to INSERTs. The total number and genomic distribution of PB INSERTs, as well as the availability of each PB insertional LINE can also be viewed with user-friendly interfaces. PBmice is freely available at http://www.idmshanghai.cn/PBmice or http://www.scbit.org/PBmice/ . 
 miRBase is the central online repository for microRNA (miRNA) nomenclature, sequence data, annotation and target prediction. The current release (10.0) contains 5071 miRNA loci from 58 species, expressing 5922 distinct mature miRNA sequences: a growth of over 2000 sequences in the past 2 years. miRBase provides a range of data to facilitate studies of miRNA genomics: all miRNAs are mapped to their genomic coordinates. Clusters of miRNA sequences in the genome are highlighted, and can be defined and retrieved with any inter-miRNA distance. The overlap of miRNA sequences with annotated transcripts, both protein- and non-coding, are described. Finally, graphical views of the locations of a wide range of genomic features in model organisms allow for the first time the prediction of the likely boundaries of many miRNA primary transcripts. miRBase is available at http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/ . 
 EuroPhenome ( http://www.europhenome.org ) and EMPReSS ( http://empress.har.mrc.ac.uk/ ) form an integrated resource to provide access to data and procedures for mouse phenotyping. EMPReSS describes 96 Standard Operating Procedures for mouse phenotyping. EuroPhenome contains data resulting from carrying out EMPReSS protocols on four inbred laboratory mouse strains. As well as web interfaces, both resources support web services to enable integration with other mouse phenotyping and functional genetics resources, and are committed to initiatives to improve integration of mouse phenotype databases. EuroPhenome will be the repository for a recently initiated effort to carry out large-scale phenotyping on a large number of knockout mouse lines (EUMODIC). 
 We have developed coliSNP, a database server ( http://yayoi.kansai.jaea.go.jp/colisnp ) that maps non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) on the three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins. Once a week, the SNP data from the dbSNP database and the protein structure data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are downloaded, and the correspondence of the two data sets is automatically tabulated in the coliSNP database. Given an amino acid sequence, protein name or PDB ID, the server will immediately provide known nsSNP information, including the amino acid mutation caused by the nsSNP, the solvent accessibility, the secondary structure and the flanking residues of the mutated residue in a single page. The position of the nsSNP within the amino acid sequence and on the 3D structure of the protein can also be observed. The database provides key information with which to judge whether an observed nsSNP critically affects protein function and/or stability. As far as we know, this is the only web-based nsSNP database that automatically compiles SNP and protein information in a concise manner. 
 The RNA FRABASE is a web-accessible engine with a relational database, which allows for the automatic search of user-defined, 3D RNA fragments within a set of RNA structures. This is a new tool to search and analyse RNA structures, directed at the 3D structure modelling. The user needs to input either RNA sequence(s) and/or secondary structure(s) given in a ‘dot-bracket’ notation. The algorithm searching for the requested 3D RNA fragments is very efficient. As of August 2007, the database contains: (i) RNA sequences and secondary structures, in the ‘dot-bracket’ notation, derived from 1065 protein data bank (PDB)-deposited RNA structures and their complexes, (ii) a collection of atom coordinates of unmodified and modified nucleotide residues occurring in RNA structures, (iii) calculated RNA torsion angles and sugar pucker parameters and (iv) information about base pairs. Advanced query involves filters sensitive to: modified residue contents, experimental method used and limits of conformational parameters. The output list of query-matching RNA fragments gives access to their coordinates in the PDB-format files, ready for direct download and visualization, conformational parameters and information about base pairs. The RNA FRABASE is automatically, monthly updated and is freely accessible at http://rnafrabase.ibch.poznan.pl (mirror at http://cerber.cs.put.poznan.pl/rnadb ). 
 Sequence similarity/database searching is a cornerstone of molecular biology. PairsDB is a database intended to make exploring protein sequences and their similarity relationships quick and easy. Behind PairsDB is a comprehensive collection of protein sequences and BLAST and PSI-BLAST alignments between them. Instead of running BLAST or PSI-BLAST individually on each request, results are retrieved instantaneously from a database of pre-computed alignments. Filtering options allow you to find a set of sequences satisfying a set of criteria—for example, all human proteins with solved structure and without transmembrane segments. PairsDB is continually updated and covers all sequences in Uniprot. The data is stored in a MySQL relational database. Data files will be made available for download at ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/molbio. PairsDB can also be accessed interactively at http://pairsdb.csc.fi . PairsDB data is a valuable platform to build various downstream automated analysis pipelines. For example, the graph of all-against-all similarity relationships is the starting point for clustering protein families, delineating domains, improving alignment accuracy by consistency measures, and defining orthologous genes. Moreover, query-anchored stacked sequence alignments, profiles and consensus sequences are useful in studies of sequence conservation patterns for clues about possible functional sites. 
 The MUGEN mouse database (MMdb) ( www.mugen-noe.org/database/ ) is a database of murine models of immune processes and immunological diseases. Its aim is to share and publicize information on mouse strain characteristics and availability from participating institutions. MMdb's basic classification of models is based on three major research application categories: Models of Human Disease, Models of Immune Processes and Transgenic Tools. Data on mutant strains includes detailed information on affected gene(s), mutant allele(s) and genetic background (DNA origin, gene targeted, host and backcross strain background). Each gene/transgene index also includes IDs and direct links to Ensembl, ArrayExpress, EURExpress and NCBI's Entrez Gene database. Phenotypic description is standardized and hierarchically structured, based on MGI's mammalian phenotypic ontology terms. Availability (e.g. live mice, cryopreserved embryos, sperm and ES cells) is clearly indicated, along with handling and genotyping details (in the form of documents or hyperlinks) and all relevant contact information (including EMMA and Jax/IMSR hyperlinks where available). MMdb's design offers a user-friendly query interface and provides instant access to the list of mutant strains and genes. Database access is free of charge and there are no registration requirements for data querying. 
ChemBank ( http://chembank.broad.harvard.edu/ ) is a public, web-based informatics environment developed through a collaboration between the Chemical Biology Program and Platform at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. This knowledge environment includes freely available data derived from small molecules and small-molecule screens and resources for studying these data. ChemBank is unique among small-molecule databases in its dedication to the storage of raw screening data, its rigorous definition of screening experiments in terms of statistical hypothesis testing, and its metadata-based organization of screening experiments into projects involving collections of related assays. ChemBank stores an increasingly varied set of measurements derived from cells and other biological assay systems treated with small molecules. Analysis tools are available and are continuously being developed that allow the relationships between small molecules, cell measurements, and cell states to be studied. Currently, ChemBank stores information on hundreds of thousands of small molecules and hundreds of biomedically relevant assays that have been performed at the Broad Institute by collaborators from the worldwide research community. The goal of ChemBank is to provide life scientists unfettered access to biomedically relevant data and tools heretofore available primarily in the private sector. 
 Alternative splicing is known to be one of the major sources for functional diversity in higher eukaryotes. Several splicing isoforms have been characterized in the literature that play important roles in cellular processes like apoptosis or signal transduction pathways. Splicing events can often be detected on the mRNA level by large-scale cDNA or EST experiments and such data is collected and annotated in several databases. Nevertheless, the effects of splicing on the structure of a protein are largely unknown. The ProSAS (Protein Structure and Alternative Splicing) database fills this gap and provides a unified resource for analyzing effects of alternative splicing events in the context of protein structures. ProSAS comprehensively annotates and models protein structures for several Ensembl genomes as well as SwissProt entries harbouring splicing events. Alternative isoforms annotated in Ensembl or SwissProt can be analyzed on the protein structure and protein function level using an intuitive user interface that provides several features and tools for a structure-based analysis of alternative splicing events. The ProSAS database is freely accessible at http://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/ProSAS . 
 Virulence factor database (VFDB) was set up in 2004 dedicated for providing current knowledge of virulence factors (VFs) from various medical significant bacterial pathogens to facilitate pathogenomic research. Nowadays, complete genome sequences of almost all the major pathogenic microbes have been determined, which makes comparative genomics a powerful approach for uncovering novel virulence determinants and hidden aspects of pathogenesis. VFDB was therefore upgraded to present the enormous diversity of bacterial genomes in terms of virulence genes and their organization. The VFDB 2008 release includes the following new features; (i) detailed tabular comparison of virulence composition of a given genome with other genomes of the same genus, (ii) multiple alignments and statistical analysis of homologous VFs and (iii) graphical comparison of genomic organizations of virulence genes. Comparative analysis of the numerous VFs will improve our understanding of the nature and evolution of virulence, as well as the development of new therapeutic and preventive strategies. VFDB 2008 release offers more user-friendly tools for comparative pathogenomics and it is publicly accessible at http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/ . 
 Proteins containing heme, iron(protoporphyrin IX) and its variants, continue to be one of the most-studied classes of biomolecules due to their diverse range of biological functions. The literature is abundant with reports of structural and functional characterization of individual heme proteins which demonstrate that heme protein reduction potential values, Em , span the range from –550 mV to +450 mV versus SHE. In order to unite these data for the purposes of global analysis, a new web-based resource of heme protein structure–function relationships is presented: the Heme Protein Database (HPD). This database is the first of its kind to combine heme protein structural classifications including protein fold, heme type and heme axial ligands, with heme protein reduction potential values in a web-searchable format. The HPD is located at http://heme.chem.columbia.edu/heme.php . The data illustrate that heme protein Em values are modulated over a 300 mV range by the type of global protein fold, a 600 mV range by the type of porphyrin and an 800 mV range by the axial ligands. Thus, the 1 V range observed in heme protein reduction potential values in biological systems arises from subtle combinations of these various factors. 
 In this article, we introduce the Gypsy Database (GyDB) of mobile genetic elements, an in-progress database devoted to the non-redundant analysis and evolutionary-based classification of mobile genetic elements. In this first version, we contemplate eukaryotic Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae long terminal repeats (LTR) retroelements. Phylogenetic analyses based on the gag-pro-pol internal region commonly presented by these two groups strongly support a certain number of previously described Ty3/Gypsy lineages originally reported from reverse-transcriptase (RT) analyses. Vertebrate retroviruses ( Retroviridae ) are also constituted in several monophyletic groups consistent with genera proposed by the ICTV nomenclature, as well as with the current tendency to classify both endogenous and exogenous retroviruses by three major classes (I, II and III). Our inference indicates that all protein domains codified by the gag-pro-pol internal region of these two groups agree in a collective presentation of a particular evolutionary history, which may be used as a main criterion to differentiate their molecular diversity in a comprehensive collection of phylogenies and non-redundant molecular profiles useful in the identification of new Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae species. The GyDB project is available at http://gydb.uv.es . 
 The 3D rRNA modification maps database is the first general resource of information about the locations of modified nucleotides within the 3D structure of the full ribosome, with mRNA and tRNAs in the A-, P- and E-sites. The database supports analyses for several model organisms, including higher eukaryotes, and enables users to construct 3D maps for other organisms. Data are provided for human and plant ( Arabidopsis ) ribosomes, and for other representative organisms from eubacteria, archaea and eukarya. Additionally, the database integrates information about positions of modifications within rRNA sequences and secondary structures, as well as links to other databases and resources about modifications and their biosynthesis. Displaying positions of modified nucleotides is fully manageable. Views of each modified nucleotide are controlled by individual buttons and buttons also control the visibility of different ribosomal molecular components. A section called ‘Paint Your Own’ enables the user to create a 3D modification map for rRNA from any organism where sites of modification are known. This section also provides capabilities for visualizing nucleotides of interest in rRNA or tRNA, as well as particular amino acids in ribosomal proteins. The database can be accessed at http://people.biochem.umass.edu/fournierlab/3dmodmap/
 The Ensembl project ( http://www.ensembl.org ) is a comprehensive genome information system featuring an integrated set of genome annotation, databases and other information for chordate and selected model organism and disease vector genomes. As of release 47 (October 2007), Ensembl fully supports 35 species, with preliminary support for six additional species. New species in the past year include platypus and horse. Major additions and improvements to Ensembl since our previous report include extensive support for functional genomics data in the form of a specialized functional genomics database, genome-wide maps of protein–DNA interactions and the Ensembl regulatory build; support for customization of the Ensembl web interface through the addition of user accounts and user groups; and increased support for genome resequencing. We have also introduced new comparative genomics-based data mining options and report on the continued development of our software infrastructure. 
 The Ensembl Trace Archive ( http://trace.ensembl.org/ ) and the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/ ), known together as the European Nucleotide Archive, continue to see growth in data volume and diversity. Selected major developments of 2007 are presented briefly, along with data submission and retrieval information. In the face of increasing requirements for nucleotide trace, sequence and annotation data archiving, data capture priority decisions have been taken at the European Nucleotide Archive. Priorities are discussed in terms of how reliably information can be captured, the long-term benefits of its capture and the ease with which it can be captured. 
 ORegAnno is an open-source, open-access database and literature curation system for community-based annotation of experimentally identified DNA regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and regulatory variants. The current release comprises 30 145 records curated from 922 publications and describing regulatory sequences for over 3853 genes and 465 transcription factors from 19 species. A new feature called the ‘publication queue’ allows users to input relevant papers from scientific literature as targets for annotation. The queue contains 4438 gene regulation papers entered by experts and another 54 351 identified by text-mining methods. Users can enter or ‘check out’ papers from the queue for manual curation using a series of user-friendly annotation pages. A typical record entry consists of species, sequence type, sequence, target gene, binding factor, experimental outcome and one or more lines of experimental evidence. An evidence ontology was developed to describe and categorize these experiments. Records are cross-referenced to Ensembl or Entrez gene identifiers, PubMed and dbSNP and can be visualized in the Ensembl or UCSC genome browsers. All data are freely available through search pages, XML data dumps or web services at: http://www.oreganno.org . 
 FlyBase ( http://flybase.org ) is the primary resource for molecular and genetic information on the Drosophilidae . The database serves researchers of diverse backgrounds and interests, and offers several different query tools to provide efficient access to the data available and facilitate the discovery of significant relationships within the database. Recently, FlyBase has developed Interactions Browser and enhanced GBrowse, which are graphical query tools, and made improvements to the search tools QuickSearch and QueryBuilder. Furthermore, these search tools have been integrated with Batch Download and new analysis tools through a more flexible search results list, providing powerful ways of exploring the data in FlyBase. 
 In protein research, structural classifications of protein domains provided by databases such as SCOP play an important role. However, as such databases have to be curated and prepared carefully, they update only up to a few times per year, and in between newly entered PDB structures cannot be used in cases where a structural classification is required. The Automated Protein Structure Identification (AutoPSI) database delivers predicted SCOP classifications for several thousand yet unclassified PDB entries as well as millions of UniProt sequences in an automated fashion. In order to obtain predictions, we make use of two recently published methods, namely AutoSCOP (sequence-based) and Vorolign (structure-based) and the consensus of both. With our predictions, we bridge the gap between SCOP versions for proteins with known structures in the PDB and additionally make structure predictions for a very large number of UniProt proteins. AutoPSI is freely accessible at http://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/AutoPSIDB . 
 Panzea ( http://www.panzea.org ), the public web site of the project ‘Molecular and Functional Diversity in the Maize Genome’, has expanded over the past two years in data content, display tools and informational sections. The most significant data content expansions occurred for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), sequencing, isozyme and phenotypic data types. We have enhanced our existing web display tools and have launched a number of new tools for data display and analysis. For example, we have implemented one that allows users to find polymorphisms between two accessions, a geographic map tool to visualize the geographic distribution of SNPs, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and isozyme alleles and a graphical view of the placement of Panzea markers and genes/loci on genetic and physical maps. One goal of the informatics component of our project has been to generate code that can be used by other groups. We have enhanced our existing code base and have made our new tools available. Finally, we have also made available new informational sections as part of our educational and outreach efforts. 
 Selenoproteins are a diverse group of proteins usually misidentified and misannotated in sequence databases. The presence of an in-frame UGA (stop) codon in the coding sequence of selenoprotein genes precludes their identification and correct annotation. The in-frame UGA codons are recoded to cotranslationally incorporate selenocysteine, a rare selenium-containing amino acid. The development of ad hoc experimental and, more recently, computational approaches have allowed the efficient identification and characterization of the selenoproteomes of a growing number of species. Today, dozens of selenoprotein families have been described and more are being discovered in recently sequenced species, but the correct genomic annotation is not available for the majority of these genes. SelenoDB is a long-term project that aims to provide, through the collaborative effort of experimental and computational researchers, automatic and manually curated annotations of selenoprotein genes, proteins and SECIS elements. Version 1.0 of the database includes an initial set of eukaryotic genomic annotations, with special emphasis on the human selenoproteome, for immediate inspection by selenium researchers or incorporation into more general databases. SelenoDB is freely available at http://www.selenodb.org . 
 Group I Intron Sequence and Structure Database (GISSD) is a specialized and comprehensive database for group I introns, focusing on the integration of useful group I intron information from available databases and providing de novo data that is essential for understanding these introns at a systematic level. This database presents 1789 complete intron records, including the nucleotide sequence of each annotated intron plus 15 nt of the upstream and downstream exons, and the pseudoknots-containing secondary structures predicted by integrating comparative sequence analyses and minimal free energy algorithms. These introns represent all 14 subgroups, with their structure-based alignments being separately provided. Both structure predictions and alignments were done manually and iteratively adjusted, which yielded a reliable consensus structure for each subgroup. These consensus structures allowed us to judge the confidence of 20 085 group I introns previously found by the INFERNAL program and to classify them into subgroups automatically. The database provides intron-associated taxonomy information from GenBank, allowing one to view the detailed distribution of all group I introns. CDSs residing in introns and 3D structure information are also integrated if available. About 17 000 group I introns have been validated in this database; ∼ 95% of them belong to the IC3 subgroup and reside in the chloroplast tRNA Leu gene. The GISSD database can be accessed at http://www.rna.whu.edu.cn/gissd / 
 The pathogen–host interaction database (PHI-base) is a web-accessible database that catalogues experimentally verified pathogenicity, virulence and effector genes from bacterial, fungal and Oomycete pathogens, which infect human, animal, plant, insect, fish and fungal hosts. Plant endophytes are also included. PHI-base is therefore an invaluable resource for the discovery of genes in medically and agronomically important pathogens, which may be potential targets for chemical intervention. The database is freely accessible to both academic and non-academic users. This publication describes recent additions to the database and both current and future applications. The number of fields that characterize PHI-base entries has almost doubled. Important additional fields deal with new experimental methods, strain information, pathogenicity islands and external references that link the database to external resources, for example, gene ontology terms and Locus IDs. Another important addition is the inclusion of anti-infectives and their target genes that makes it possible to predict the compounds, that may interact with newly identified virulence factors. In parallel, the curation process has been improved and now involves several external experts. On the technical side, several new search tools have been provided and the database is also now distributed in XML format. PHI-base is available at: http://www.phi-base.org/ . 
 Gene3D provides comprehensive structural and functional annotation of most available protein sequences, including the UniProt, RefSeq and Integr8 resources. The main structural annotation is generated through scanning these sequences against the CATH structural domain database profile-HMM library. CATH is a database of manually derived PDB-based structural domains, placed within a hierarchy reflecting topology, homology and conservation and is able to infer more ancient and divergent homology relationships than sequence-based approaches. This data is supplemented with Pfam-A, other non-domain structural predictions (i.e. coiled coils) and experimental data from UniProt. In order to enhance the investigations possible with this data, we have also incorporated a variety of protein annotation resources, including protein–protein interaction data, GO functional assignments, KEGG pathways, FUNCAT functional descriptions and links to microarray expression data. All of this data can be accessed through a newly re-designed website that has a focus on flexibility and clarity, with searches that can be restricted to a single genome or across the entire sequence database. Currently Gene3D contains over 3.5 million domain assignments for nearly 5 million proteins including 527 completed genomes. This is available at: http://gene3d.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/
 The University of California, Santa Cruz, Genome Browser Database (GBD) provides integrated sequence and annotation data for a large collection of vertebrate and model organism genomes. Seventeen new assemblies have been added to the database in the past year, for a total coverage of 19 vertebrate and 21 invertebrate species as of September 2007. For each assembly, the GBD contains a collection of annotation data aligned to the genomic sequence. Highlights of this year's additions include a 28-species human-based vertebrate conservation annotation, an enhanced UCSC Genes set, and more human variation, MGC, and ENCODE data. The database is optimized for fast interactive performance with a set of web-based tools that may be used to view, manipulate, filter and download the annotation data. New toolset features include the Genome Graphs tool for displaying genome-wide data sets, session saving and sharing, better custom track management, expanded Genome Browser configuration options and a Genome Browser wiki site. The downloadable GBD data, the companion Genome Browser toolset and links to documentation and related information can be found at: http://genome.ucsc.edu/ . 
 Understanding how genetic variation affects the molecular function of gene products is an emergent area of bioinformatic research. Here, we present updates to MutDB ( http://www.mutdb.org ), a tool aiming to aid bioinformatic studies by integrating publicly available databases of human genetic variation with molecular features and clinical phenotype data. MutDB, first developed in 2002, integrates annotated SNPs in dbSNP and amino acid substitutions in Swiss-Prot with protein structural information, links to scores that predict functional disruption and other useful annotations. Though these functional annotations are mainly focused on nonsynonymous SNPs, some information on other SNP types included in dbSNP is also provided. Additionally, we have developed a new functionality that facilitates KEGG pathway visualization of genes containing SNPs and a SNP query tool for visualizing and exporting sets of SNPs that share selected features based on certain filters. 
 The interactions between polyanions (PAs) and polyanion-binding proteins (PABPs) have been found to play significant roles in many essential biological processes including intracellular organization, transport and protein folding. Furthermore, many neurodegenerative disease-related proteins are PABPs. Thus, a better understanding of PA/PABP interactions may not only enhance our understandings of biological systems but also provide new clues to these deadly diseases. The literature in this field is widely scattered, suggesting the need for a comprehensive and searchable database of PABPs. The DB-PABP is a comprehensive, manually curated and searchable database of experimentally characterized PABPs. It is freely available and can be accessed online at http://pabp.bcf.ku.edu/DB_PABP/ . The DB-PABP was implemented as a MySQL relational database. An interactive web interface was created using Java Server Pages (JSP). The search page of the database is organized into a main search form and a section for utilities. The main search form enables custom searches via four menus: protein names, polyanion names, the source species of the proteins and the methods used to discover the interactions. Available utilities include a commonality matrix, a function of listing PABPs by the number of interacting polyanions and a string search for author surnames. The DB-PABP is maintained at the University of Kansas. We encourage users to provide feedback and submit new data and references. 
 Binding MOAD (Mother of All Databases) is a database of 9836 protein–ligand crystal structures. All biologically relevant ligands are annotated, and experimental binding-affinity data is reported when available. Binding MOAD has almost doubled in size since it was originally introduced in 2004, demonstrating steady growth with each annual update. Several technologies, such as natural language processing, help drive this constant expansion. Along with increasing data, Binding MOAD has improved usability. The website now showcases a faster, more featured viewer to examine the protein–ligand structures. Ligands have additional chemical data, allowing for cheminformatics mining. Lastly, logins are no longer necessary, and Binding MOAD is freely available to all at http://www.BindingMOAD.org . 
 Phosphoprotein-binding domains (PPBDs) mediate many important cellular and molecular processes. Ten PPBDs have been known to exist in the human proteome, namely, 14-3-3, BRCT, C2, FHA, MH2, PBD, PTB, SH2, WD-40 and WW. PepCyber:P ∼ PEP is a newly constructed database specialized in documenting human PPBD-containing proteins and PPBD-mediated interactions. Our motivation is to provide the research community with a rich information source emphasizing the reported, experimentally validated data for specific PPBD–PPEP interactions. This information is not only useful for designing, comparing and validating the relevant experiments, but it also serves as a knowledge-base for computationally constructing systems signaling pathways and networks. PepCyber:P ∼ PEP is accessible through the URL, http://www.pepcyber.org/PPEP/ . The current release of the database contains 7044 PPBD-mediated interactions involving 337 PPBD-containing proteins and 1123 substrate proteins. 
 Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are expressed in mammalian germline cells and have been identified as key players in germline development. These molecules, typically of length 25–33 nt, associate with Piwi proteins of the Argonaute family to form the Piwi-interacting RNA complex. These small regulatory RNAs have been implicated in spermatogenesis, repression of retrotransposon transposition in germline cells, epigenetic regulation and positive regulation of translation and mRNA stability. piRNABank is a highly user-friendly resource which stores empirically known sequences and other related information on piRNAs reported in human, mouse and rat. The database supports organism and chromosome-wise comprehensive search features including accession numbers, localization on chromosomes, gene name or symbol, sequence homology-based search, clusters and corresponding genes and repeat elements. It also displays each piRNA or piRNA cluster on a graphical genome-wide map ( http://pirnabank.ibab.ac.in/ ). 
 Three-prime untranslated regions (3′UTRs) are widely recognized as important post-transcriptional regulatory regions of mRNAs. RNA-binding proteins and small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to functional elements within 3′UTRs to influence mRNA stability, translation and localization. These interactions play many important roles in development, metabolism and disease. However, even in the most well-annotated metazoan genomes, 3′UTRs and their functional elements are not well defined. Comprehensive and accurate genome-wide annotation of 3′UTRs and their functional elements is thus critical. We have developed an open-access database, available at http://www.UTRome.org , to provide a rich and comprehensive resource for 3′UTR biology in the well-characterized, experimentally tractable model system Caenorhabditis elegans . UTRome.org combines data from public repositories and a large-scale effort we are undertaking to characterize 3′UTRs and their functional elements in C. elegans , including 3′UTR sequences, graphical displays, predicted and validated functional elements, secondary structure predictions and detailed data from our cloning pipeline. UTRome.org will grow substantially over time to encompass individual 3′UTR isoforms for the majority of genes, new and revised functional elements, and in vivo data on 3′UTR function as they become available. The UTRome database thus represents a powerful tool to better understand the biology of 3′UTRs. 
 The Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR) is a central repository of curated and integrated genetics and genomics data of Rosaceae, an economically important family which includes apple, cherry, peach, pear, raspberry, rose and strawberry. GDR contains annotated databases of all publicly available Rosaceae ESTs, the genetically anchored peach physical map, Rosaceae genetic maps and comprehensively annotated markers and traits. The ESTs are assembled to produce unigene sets of each genus and the entire Rosaceae. Other annotations include putative function, microsatellites, open reading frames, single nucleotide polymorphisms, gene ontology terms and anchored map position where applicable. Most of the published Rosaceae genetic maps can be viewed and compared through CMap, the comparative map viewer. The peach physical map can be viewed using WebFPC/WebChrom, and also through our integrated GDR map viewer, which serves as a portal to the combined genetic, transcriptome and physical mapping information. ESTs, BACs, markers and traits can be queried by various categories and the search result sites are linked to the mapping visualization tools. GDR also provides online analysis tools such as a batch BLAST/FASTA server for the GDR datasets, a sequence assembly server and microsatellite and primer detection tools. GDR is available at http://www.rosaceae.org . 
 LOCATE is a curated, web-accessible database that houses data describing the membrane organization and subcellular localization of mouse and human proteins. Over the past 2 years, the data in LOCATE have grown substantially. The database now contains high-quality localization data for 20% of the mouse proteome and general localization annotation for nearly 36% of the mouse proteome. The proteome annotated in LOCATE is from the RIKEN FANTOM Consortium Isoform Protein Sequence sets which contains 58 128 mouse and 64 637 human protein isoforms. Other additions include computational subcellular localization predictions, automated computational classification of experimental localization image data, prediction of protein sorting signals and third party submission of literature data. Collectively, this database provides localization proteome for individual subcellular compartments that will underpin future systematic investigations of these regions. It is available at http://locate.imb.uq.edu.au/
 Norine is the first database entirely dedicated to nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). In bacteria and fungi, in addition to the traditional ribosomal proteic biosynthesis, an alternative ribosome-independent pathway called NRP synthesis allows peptide production. It is performed by huge protein complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). The molecules synthesized by NRPS contain a high proportion of nonproteogenic amino acids. The primary structure of these peptides is not always linear but often more complex and may contain cycles and branchings. In recent years, NRPs attracted a lot of attention because of their biological activities and pharmacological properties (antibiotic, immunosuppressor, antitumor, etc.). However, few computational resources and tools dedicated to those peptides have been available so far. Norine is focused on NRPs and contains more than 700 entries. The database is freely accessible at http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/norine/ . It provides a complete computational tool for systematic study of NRPs in numerous species, and as such, should permit to obtain a better knowledge of these metabolic products and underlying biological mechanisms, and ultimately to contribute to the redesigning of natural products in order to obtain new bioactive compounds for drug discovery. 
 The UCSD-Nature Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages ( http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule ) provides essential information on more than 3800 mammalian proteins involved in cellular signaling. The Molecule Pages contain expert-authored and peer-reviewed information based on the published literature, complemented by regularly updated information derived from public data source references and sequence analysis. The expert-authored data includes both a full-text review about the molecule, with citations, and highly structured data for bioinformatics interrogation, including information on protein interactions and states, transitions between states and protein function. The expert-authored pages are anonymously peer reviewed by the Nature Publishing Group. The Molecule Pages data is present in an object-relational database format and is freely accessible to the authors, the reviewers and the public from a web browser that serves as a presentation layer. The Molecule Pages are supported by several applications that along with the database and the interfaces form a multi-tier architecture. The Molecule Pages and the Signaling Gateway are routinely accessed by a very large research community. 
 We developed a database called RNAJunction that contains structure and sequence information for RNA structural elements such as helical junctions, internal loops, bulges and loop–loop interactions. Our database provides a user-friendly way of searching structural elements by PDB code, structural classification, sequence, keyword or inter-helix angles. In addition, the structural data was subjected to energy minimization. This database is useful for analyzing RNA structures as well as for designing novel RNA structures on a nanoscale. The database can be accessed at: http://rnajunction.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/
 Better characterization of binding sites in proteins and the ability to accurately predict their location and energetic properties are major challenges which, if addressed, would have many valuable practical applications. Unfortunately, reliable benchmark datasets of binding sites in proteins are still sorely lacking. Here, we present LigASite (‘LIGand Attachment SITE’), a gold-standard dataset of binding sites in 550 proteins of known structures. LigASite consists exclusively of biologically relevant binding sites in proteins for which at least one apo - and one holo -structure are available. In defining the binding sites for each protein, information from all holo -structures is combined, considering in each case the quaternary structure defined by the PQS server. LigASite is built using simple criteria and is automatically updated as new structures become available in the PDB, thereby guaranteeing optimal data coverage over time. Both a redundant and a culled non-redundant version of the dataset is available at http://www.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/Users/benoit/LigASite . The website interface allows users to search the dataset by PDB identifiers, ligand identifiers, protein names or sequence, and to look for structural matches as defined by the CATH homologous superfamilies. The datasets can be downloaded from the website as Schema-validated XML files or comma-separated flat files. 
 The Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database is a comprehensive ordering of all proteins of known structure, according to their evolutionary and structural relationships. The SCOP hierarchy comprises the following levels: Species , Protein , Family , Superfamily , Fold and Class . While keeping the original classification scheme intact, we have changed the production of SCOP in order to cope with a rapid growth of new structural data and to facilitate the discovery of new protein relationships. We describe ongoing developments and new features implemented in SCOP. A new update protocol supports batch classification of new protein structures by their detected relationships at Family and Superfamily levels in contrast to our previous sequential handling of new structural data by release date. We introduce pre-SCOP, a preview of the SCOP developmental version that enables earlier access to the information on new relationships. We also discuss the impact of worldwide Structural Genomics initiatives, which are producing new protein structures at an increasing rate, on the rates of discovery and growth of protein families and superfamilies. SCOP can be accessed at http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop . 
 The Topology Data Bank of Transmembrane Proteins (TOPDB) is the most complete and comprehensive collection of transmembrane protein datasets containing experimentally derived topology information currently available. It contains information gathered from the literature and from public databases available on the internet for more than a thousand transmembrane proteins. TOPDB collects details of various experiments that were carried out to learn about the topology of particular transmembrane proteins. In addition to experimental data from the literature, an extensive collection of structural data was also compiled from PDB and from PDBTM. Because topology information is often incomplete, for each protein in the database the most probable topology that is consistent with the collected experimental constraints was also calculated using the HMMTOP transmembrane topology prediction algorithm. Each record in TOPDB also contains information on the given protein sequence, name, organism and cross references to various other databases. The web interface of TOPDB includes tools for searching, relational querying and data browsing as well as for visualization. TOPDB is designed to bridge the gap between the number of transmembrane proteins available in sequence databases and the publicly accessible topology information of experimentally or computationally studied transmembrane proteins. TOPDB is available at http://topdb.enzim.hu . 
 The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) aims to assign a unique and ideally meaningful name and symbol to every human gene. The HGNC database currently comprises over 24 000 public records containing approved human gene nomenclature and associated gene information. Following our recent relocation to the European Bioinformatics Institute our homepage can now be found at http://www.genenames.org , with direct links to the searchable HGNC database and other related database resources, such as the HCOP orthology search tool and manually curated gene family webpages. 
 Orthologs are genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation. Currently, with the rapid growth of transcriptome data of various species, more reliable orthology information is prerequisite for further studies. However, detection of orthologs could be erroneous if pairwise distance-based methods, such as reciprocal BLAST searches, are utilized. Thus, as a sub-database of H-InvDB, an integrated database of annotated human genes ( http://h-invitational.jp/ ), we constructed a fully curated database of evolutionary features of human genes, called ‘Evola’. In the process of the ortholog detection, computational analysis based on conserved genome synteny and transcript sequence similarity was followed by manual curation by researchers examining phylogenetic trees. In total, 18 968 human genes have orthologs among 11 vertebrates (chimpanzee, mouse, cow, chicken, zebrafish, etc.), either computationally detected or manually curated orthologs. Evola provides amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees of orthologs and homologs. In ‘  d N /  d S view’, natural selection on genes can be analyzed between human and other species. In ‘Locus maps’, all transcript variants and their exon/intron structures can be compared among orthologous gene loci. We expect the Evola to serve as a comprehensive and reliable database to be utilized in comparative analyses for obtaining new knowledge about human genes. Evola is available at http://www.h-invitational.jp/evola/ . 
 The multitude of bacterial genome sequences being determined has generated new requirements regarding the development of databases and graphical interfaces: these are needed to organize and retrieve biological information from the comparison of large sets of genomes. GenoList ( http://genolist.pasteur.fr/GenoList ) is an integrated environment dedicated to querying and analyzing genome data from bacterial species. GenoList inherits from the SubtiList database and web server, the reference data resource for the Bacillus subtilis genome. The data model was extended to hold information about relationships between genomes (e.g. protein families). The web user interface was designed to primarily take into account biologists’ needs and modes of operation. Along with standard query and browsing capabilities, comparative genomics facilities are available, including subtractive proteome analysis. One key feature is the integration of the many tools accessible in the environment. As an example, it is straightforward to identify the genes that are specific to a group of bacteria, export them as a tab-separated list, get their protein sequences and run a multiple alignment on a subset of these sequences. 
 The Mouse Genome Database, (MGD, http://www.informatics.jax.org /), integrates genetic, genomic and phenotypic information about the laboratory mouse, a primary animal model for studying human biology and disease. MGD data content includes comprehensive characterization of genes and their functions, standardized descriptions of mouse phenotypes, extensive integration of DNA and protein sequence data, normalized representation of genome and genome variant information including comparative data on mammalian genes. Data within MGD are obtained from diverse sources including manual curation of the biomedical literature, direct contributions from individual investigator's laboratories and major informatics resource centers such as Ensembl, UniProt and NCBI. MGD collaborates with the bioinformatics community on the development of data and semantic standards such as the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) Ontology. MGD provides a data-mining platform that enables the development of translational research hypotheses based on comparative genotype, phenotype and functional analyses. Both web-based querying and computational access to data are provided. Recent improvements in MGD described here include the association of gene trap data with mouse genes and a new batch query capability for customized data access and retrieval. 
 The cell cycle database is a biological resource that collects the most relevant information related to genes and proteins involved in human and yeast cell cycle processes. The database, which is accessible at the web site http://www.itb.cnr.it/cellcycle , has been developed in a systems biology context, since it also stores the cell cycle mathematical models published in the recent years, with the possibility to simulate them directly. The aim of our resource is to give an exhaustive view of the cell cycle process starting from its building-blocks, genes and proteins, toward the pathway they create, represented by the models. 
 Protein complexes are key molecular entities that integrate multiple gene products to perform cellular functions. The CORUM ( http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/corum/index.html ) database is a collection of experimentally verified mammalian protein complexes. Information is manually derived by critical reading of the scientific literature from expert annotators. Information about protein complexes includes protein complex names, subunits, literature references as well as the function of the complexes. For functional annotation, we use the FunCat catalogue that enables to organize the protein complex space into biologically meaningful subsets. The database contains more than 1750 protein complexes that are built from 2400 different genes, thus representing 12% of the protein-coding genes in human. A web-based system is available to query, view and download the data. CORUM provides a comprehensive dataset of protein complexes for discoveries in systems biology, analyses of protein networks and protein complex-associated diseases. Comparable to the MIPS reference dataset of protein complexes from yeast, CORUM intends to serve as a reference for mammalian protein complexes. 
 AAindex is a database of numerical indices representing various physicochemical and biochemical properties of amino acids and pairs of amino acids. We have added a collection of protein contact potentials to the AAindex as a new section. Accordingly AAindex consists of three sections now: AAindex1 for the amino acid index of 20 numerical values, AAindex2 for the amino acid substitution matrix and AAindex3 for the statistical protein contact potentials. All data are derived from published literature. The database can be accessed through the DBGET/LinkDB system at GenomeNet ( http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bfind?aaindex ) or downloaded by anonymous FTP ( ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/db/community/aaindex/ ). 
 Venomous animals possess an arsenal of toxins for predation and defense. These toxins have great diversity in function and structure as well as evolution and therefore are of value in both basic and applied research. Recently, toxinomics researches using cDNA library sequencing and proteomics profiling have revealed a large number of new toxins. Although several previous groups have attempted to manage these data, most of them are restricted to certain taxonomic groups and/or lack effective systems for data query and access. In addition, the description of the function and the classification of toxins is rather inconsistent resulting in a barrier against exchanging and comparing the data. Here, we report the ATDB database and website which contains more than 3235 animal toxins from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL and related toxin databases as well as published literature. A new ontology (Toxin Ontology) was constructed to standardize the toxin annotations, which includes 745 distinct terms within four term spaces. Furthermore, more than 8423 TO terms have been manually assigned to 2132 toxins by trained biologists. Queries to the database can be conducted via a user-friendly web interface at http://protchem.hunnu.edu.cn/toxin . 
 PROSITE consists of documentation entries describing protein domains, families and functional sites, as well as associated patterns and profiles to identify them. It is complemented by ProRule, a collection of rules based on profiles and patterns, which increases the discriminatory power of profiles and patterns by providing additional information about functionally and/or structurally critical amino acids. In this article, we describe the implementation of a new method to assign a status to pattern matches, the new PROSITE web page and a new approach to improve the specificity and sensitivity of PROSITE methods. The latest version of PROSITE (release 20.19 of 11 September 2007) contains 1319 patterns, 745 profiles and 764 ProRules. Over the past 2 years, about 200 domains have been added, and now 53% of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries (release 54.2 of 11 September 2007) have a PROSITE match. PROSITE is available on the web at: http://www.expasy.org/prosite/ . 
 Correct annotation of translation initiation site (TIS) is essential for both experiments and bioinformatics studies of prokaryotic translation initiation mechanism as well as understanding of gene regulation and gene structure. Here we describe a comprehensive database ProTISA, which collects TIS confirmed through a variety of available evidences for prokaryotic genomes, including Swiss-Prot experiments record, literature, conserved domain hits and sequence alignment between orthologous genes. Moreover, by combining the predictions from our recently developed TIS post-processor, ProTISA provides a refined annotation for the public database RefSeq. Furthermore, the database annotates the potential regulatory signals associated with translation initiation at the TIS upstream region. As of July 2007, ProTISA includes 440 microbial genomes with more than 390 000 confirmed TISs. The database is available at http://mech.ctb.pku.edu.cn/protisa
 Y chromosome deletions arise frequently in human populations, where they cause sex reversal and Turner syndrome and predispose individuals to infertility and germ cell cancer. Knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) makes it possible to precisely demarcate such deletions and the repertoires of genes lost, offering insights into mechanisms of deletion and the molecular etiologies of associated phenotypes. Such deletion mapping is usually conducted using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the presence or absence of a series of Y-chromosomal DNA markers, or sequence-tagged sites (STSs). In the course of mapping intact and aberrant Y chromosomes during the past two decades, we and our colleagues have developed robust PCR assays for 1287 Y-specific STSs. These PCR assays amplify 1698 loci at an average spacing of < 14 kb across the MSY euchromatin. To facilitate mapping of deletions, we have compiled a database of these STSs, MSY Breakpoint Mapper ( http://breakpointmapper.wi.mit.edu/ ). When queried, this online database provides regionally targeted catalogs of STSs and nearby genes. MSY Breakpoint Mapper is useful for efficiently and systematically defining the breakpoint(s) of virtually any naturally occurring Y chromosome deletion. 
 G-quadruplex motifs in the RNA play significant roles in key cellular processes and human disease. While sequences capable of forming G-quadruplexes in the pre-mRNA are involved in regulation of polyadenylation and splicing events in mammalian transcripts, the G-quadruplex motifs in the UTRs may help regulate mRNA expression. GRSDB2 is a second-generation database containing information on the composition and distribution of putative Q uadruplex-forming G-Rich Sequences (QGRS) mapped in ∼29 000 eukaryotic pre-mRNA sequences, many of which are alternatively processed. The data stored in the GRSDB2 is based on computational analysis of NCBI Entrez Gene entries with the help of an improved version of the QGRS Mapper program. The database allows complex queries with a wide variety of parameters, including Gene Ontology terms. The data is displayed in a variety of formats with several additional computational capabilities. We have also developed a new database, GRS_UTRdb, containing information on the composition and distribution patterns of putative QGRS in the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of eukaryotic mRNA sequences. The goal of these experiments has been to build freely accessible resources for exploring the role of G-quadruplex structure in regulation of gene expression at post-transcriptional level. The databases can be accessed at the G-Quadruplex Resource Site at: http://bioinformatics.ramapo.edu/GQRS/ . 
 Accurate and comprehensive information about the nucleotide sequence specificity of trans -acting factors (TFs) is essential for computational and experimental analyses of gene regulatory networks. We present the Yeast Transfactome Database, a repository of sequence specificity models and condition-specific regulatory activities for a large number of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The sequence specificities in TransfactomeDB, represented as position-specific affinity matrices (PSAMs), are directly estimated from genomewide measurements of TF-binding using our previously published MatrixREDUCE algorithm, which is based on a biophysical model. For each mRNA expression profile in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, we used sequence-based regression analysis to estimate the post-translational regulatory activity of each TF for which a PSAM is available. The trans -factor activity profiles across multiple experiments available in TransfactomeDB allow the user to explore potential regulatory roles of hundreds of TFs in any of thousands of microarray experiments. Our resource is freely available at http://bussemakerlab.org/TransfactomeDB/
 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that can negatively regulate gene expression and thus control numerous cellular mechanisms. This work develops a resource, miRNAMap 2.0, for collecting experimentally verified microRNAs and experimentally verified miRNA target genes in human, mouse, rat and other metazoan genomes. Three computational tools, miRanda, RNAhybrid and TargetScan, were employed to identify miRNA targets in 3′-UTR of genes as well as the known miRNA targets. Various criteria for filtering the putative miRNA targets are applied to reduce the false positive prediction rate of miRNA target sites. Additionally, miRNA expression profiles can provide valuable clues on the characteristics of miRNAs, including tissue specificity and differential expression in cancer/normal cell. Therefore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments were performed to monitor the expression profiles of 224 human miRNAs in 18 major normal tissues in human. The negative correlation between the miRNA expression profile and the expression profiles of its target genes typically helps to elucidate the regulatory functions of the miRNA. The interface is also redesigned and enhanced. The miRNAMap 2.0 is now available at http://miRNAMap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/ . 
 IMG/M is a data management and analysis system for microbial community genomes (metagenomes) hosted at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Joint Genome Institute (JGI). IMG/M consists of metagenome data integrated with isolate microbial genomes from the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system. IMG/M provides IMG's comparative data analysis tools extended to handle metagenome data, together with metagenome-specific analysis tools. IMG/M is available at http://img.jgi.doe.gov/m
AlterORF is a searchable database that contains information regarding alternate open reading frames (ORFs) for over 1.5 million genes in 481 prokaryotic genomes. The objective of the database is to provide a platform for improving genome annotation and to serve as an aid for the identification of prokaryotic genes that potentially encode proteins in more than one reading frame. The AlterORF Database can be accessed through a web interface at www.alterorf.cl
 RegulonDB ( http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/ ) is the primary reference database offering curated knowledge of the transcriptional regulatory network of Escherichia coli K12, currently the best-known electronically encoded database of the genetic regulatory network of any free-living organism. This paper summarizes the improvements, new biology and new features available in version 6.0. Curation of original literature is, from now on, up to date for every new release. All the objects are supported by their corresponding evidences, now classified as strong or weak. Transcription factors are classified by origin of their effectors and by gene ontology class. We have now computational predictions for σ 54 and five different promoter types of the σ 70 family, as well as their corresponding − 10 and −35 boxes. In addition to those curated from the literature, we added about 300 experimentally mapped promoters coming from our own high-throughput mapping efforts. RegulonDB v.6.0 now expands beyond transcription initiation, including RNA regulatory elements, specifically riboswitches, attenuators and small RNAs, with their known associated targets. The data can be accessed through overviews of correlations about gene regulation. RegulonDB associated original literature, together with more than 4000 curation notes, can now be searched with the Textpresso text mining engine. 
MetaCyc (MetaCyc.org) is a universal database of metabolic pathways and enzymes from all domains of life. The pathways in MetaCyc are curated from the primary scientific literature, and are experimentally determined small-molecule metabolic pathways. Each reaction in a MetaCyc pathway is annotated with one or more well-characterized enzymes. Because MetaCyc contains only experimentally elucidated knowledge, it provides a uniquely high-quality resource for metabolic pathways and enzymes. BioCyc (BioCyc.org) is a collection of more than 350 organism-specific Pathway/Genome Databases (PGDBs). Each BioCyc PGDB contains the predicted metabolic network of one organism, including metabolic pathways, enzymes, metabolites and reactions predicted by the Pathway Tools software using MetaCyc as a reference database. BioCyc PGDBs also contain predicted operons and predicted pathway hole fillers—predictions of which enzymes may catalyze pathway reactions that have not been assigned to an enzyme. The BioCyc website offers many tools for computational analysis of PGDBs, including comparative analysis and analysis of omics data in a pathway context. The BioCyc PGDBs generated by SRI are offered for adoption by any interested party for the ongoing integration of metabolic and genome-related information about an organism.
 The concept of orthology is widely used to relate genes across different species using comparative genomics, and it provides the basis for inferring gene function. Here we present the web accessible OrthoDB database that catalogs groups of orthologous genes in a hierarchical manner, at each radiation of the species phylogeny, from more general groups to more fine-grained delineations between closely related species. We used a COG-like and Inparanoid-like ortholog delineation procedure on the basis of all-against-all Smith-Waterman sequence comparisons to analyze 58 eukaryotic genomes, focusing on vertebrates, insects and fungi to facilitate further comparative studies. The database is freely available at http://cegg.unige.ch/orthodb
 The knowledge about interactions between proteins and small molecules is essential for the understanding of molecular and cellular functions. However, information on such interactions is widely dispersed across numerous databases and the literature. To facilitate access to this data, STITCH (‘search tool for interactions of chemicals’) integrates information about interactions from metabolic pathways, crystal structures, binding experiments and drug–target relationships. Inferred information from phenotypic effects, text mining and chemical structure similarity is used to predict relations between chemicals. STITCH further allows exploring the network of chemical relations, also in the context of associated binding proteins. Each proposed interaction can be traced back to the original data sources. Our database contains interaction information for over 68 000 different chemicals, including 2200 drugs, and connects them to 1.5 million genes across 373 genomes and their interactions contained in the STRING database. STITCH is available at http://stitch.embl.de/
 The BioMagResBank (BMRB: www.bmrb.wisc.edu ) is a repository for experimental and derived data gathered from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic studies of biological molecules. BMRB is a partner in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). The BMRB archive consists of four main data depositories: (i) quantitative NMR spectral parameters for proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and ligands or cofactors (assigned chemical shifts, coupling constants and peak lists) and derived data (relaxation parameters, residual dipolar couplings, hydrogen exchange rates, pK a values, etc.), (ii) databases for NMR restraints processed from original author depositions available from the Protein Data Bank, (iii) time-domain (raw) spectral data from NMR experiments used to assign spectral resonances and determine the structures of biological macromolecules and (iv) a database of one- and two-dimensional 1 H and 13 C one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra for over 250 metabolites. The BMRB website provides free access to all of these data. BMRB has tools for querying the archive and retrieving information and an ftp site (ftp.bmrb.wisc.edu) where data in the archive can be downloaded in bulk. Two BMRB mirror sites exist: one at the PDBj, Protein Research Institute, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan (bmrb.protein.osaka-u.ac.jp) and the other at CERM, University of Florence, Florence, Italy (bmrb.postgenomicnmr.net/). The site at Osaka also accepts and processes data depositions. 
 The PhosPhAt database provides a resource consolidating our current knowledge of mass spectrometry-based identified phosphorylation sites in Arabidopsis and combines it with phosphorylation site prediction specifically trained on experimentally identified Arabidopsis phosphorylation motifs. The database currently contains 1187 unique tryptic peptide sequences encompassing 1053 Arabidopsis proteins. Among the characterized phosphorylation sites, there are over 1000 with unambiguous site assignments, and nearly 500 for which the precise phosphorylation site could not be determined. The database is searchable by protein accession number, physical peptide characteristics, as well as by experimental conditions (tissue sampled, phosphopeptide enrichment method). For each protein, a phosphorylation site overview is presented in tabular form with detailed information on each identified phosphopeptide. We have utilized a set of 802 experimentally validated serine phosphorylation sites to develop a method for prediction of serine phosphorylation (pSer) in Arabidopsis . An analysis of the current annotated Arabidopsis proteome yielded in 27 782 predicted phosphoserine sites distributed across 17 035 proteins. These prediction results are summarized graphically in the database together with the experimental phosphorylation sites in a whole sequence context. The Arabidopsis Protein Phosphorylation Site Database ( PhosPhAt ) provides a valuable resource to the plant science community and can be accessed through the following link http://phosphat.mpimp-golm.mpg.de
 The starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis , is a basal metazoan organism that has recently emerged as an important model system in developmental biology and evolutionary genomics. StellaBase , the Nematostella Genomics Database ( http://stellabase.org ), was developed in 2005 as a resource to support the Nematostella research community. Recently, it has become apparent that Nematostella may be a particularly useful system for studying (i) microevolutionary variation in natural populations, and (ii) the functional evolution of human disease genes. We have developed two new databases that will foster such studies: StellaBase Disease ( http://stellabase.org/disease ) is a relational database that houses 155 904 invertebrate homologous isoforms of human disease genes from four leading genomic model systems (fly, worm, yeast and Nematostella ), including 14 874 predicted genes from the sea anemone itself. StellaBase SNP ( http://stellabase.org/SNP ) is a relational database that describes the location and underlying type of mutation for 20 063 single nucleotide polymorphisms. 
 CMGSDB (Database for Computational Modeling of Gene Silencing) is an integration of heterogeneous data sources about Caenorhabditis elegans with capabilities for compositional data mining (CDM) across diverse domains. Besides gene, protein and functional annotations, CMGSDB currently unifies information about 531 RNAi phenotypes obtained from heterogeneous databases using a hierarchical scheme. A phenotype browser at the CMGSDB website serves this hierarchy and relates phenotypes to other biological entities. The application of CDM to CMGSDB produces ‘chains’ of relationships in the data by finding two-way connections between sets of biological entities. Chains can, for example, relate the knock down of a set of genes during an RNAi experiment to the disruption of a pathway or specific gene expression through another set of genes not directly related to the former set. The web interface for CMGSDB is available at https://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/cmgs/CMGSDB/, and serves individual biological entity information as well as details of all chains computed by CDM. 
 With over 100 000 species and a large community of evolutionary biologists, population ecologists, pest biologists and genome researchers, the Lepidoptera are an important insect group. Genomic resources [expressed sequence tags (ESTs), genome sequence, genetic and physical maps, proteomic and microarray datasets] are growing, but there has up to now been no single access and analysis portal for this group. Here we present ButterflyBase ( http://www.butterflybase.org ), a unified resource for lepidopteran genomics. A total of 273 077 ESTs from more than 30 different species have been clustered to generate stable unigene sets, and robust protein translations derived from each unigene cluster. Clusters and their protein translations are annotated with BLAST-based similarity, gene ontology (GO), enzyme classification (EC) and Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) terms, and are also searchable using similarity tools such as BLAST and MS-BLAST. The database supports many needs of the lepidopteran research community, including molecular marker development, orthologue prediction for deep phylogenetics, and detection of rapidly evolving proteins likely involved in host–pathogen or other evolutionary processes. ButterflyBase is expanding to include additional genomic sequence, ecological and mapping data for key species. 
Gallus GBrowse ( http://birdbase.net/cgi-bin/gbrowse/gallus/ ) provides online access to genomic and other information about the chicken, Gallus gallus . The information provided by this resource includes predicted genes and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, links to Gallus In Situ Hybridization Analysis (GEISHA), Unigene and Reactome, the genomic positions of chicken genetic markers, SNPs and microarray probes, and mappings from turkey, condor and zebra finch DNA and EST sequences to the chicken genome. We also provide a BLAT server ( http://birdbase.net/cgi-bin/webBlat ) for matching user-provided sequences to the chicken genome. These tools make the Gallus GBrowse server a valuable resource for researchers seeking genomic information regarding the chicken and other avian species. 
 The genome sequences of a large number of metazoan species are now known. As multiple closely related genomes are sequenced, comparative studies that previously focussed on only pairs of genomes can now be extended over whole clades. The o rthologous and pa ralogous t ranscripts i n c lades (OPTIC) database currently provides sets of gene predictions and orthology assignments for three clades: (i) amniotes, including human, dog, mouse, opossum, platypus and chicken (17 443 orthologous groups); (ii) a Drosophila clade of 12 species (12 889 orthologous groups) and (iii) a nematode clade of four species (13 626 orthologous groups). Gene predictions, multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees are freely available to browse and download from http://genserv.anat.ox.ac.uk/clades . Further genomes and clades will be added in the future. 
 EndoNet is an information resource about intercellular regulatory communication. It provides information about hormones, hormone receptors, the sources (i.e. cells, tissues and organs) where the hormones are synthesized and secreted, and where the respective receptors are expressed. The database focuses on the regulatory relations between them. An elementary communication is displayed as a causal link from a cell that secretes a particular hormone to those cells which express the corresponding hormone receptor and respond to the hormone. Whenever expression, synthesis and/or secretion of another hormone are part of this response, it renders the corresponding cell an internal node of the resulting network. This intercellular communication network coordinates the function of different organs. Therefore, the database covers the hierarchy of cellular organization of tissues and organs as it has been modeled in the Cytomer ontology, which has now been directly embedded into EndoNet. The user can query the database; the results can be used to visualize the intercellular information flow. A newly implemented hormone classification enables to browse the database and may be used as alternative entry point. EndoNet is accessible at: http://endonet.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de/
 New methods and tools are needed to exploit the unprecedented source of information made available by the completed and ongoing whole genome sequencing projects. The Narcisse database is dedicated to the study of genome conservation, from sequence similarities to conserved chromosomal segments or conserved syntenies, for a large number of animals, plants and bacterial completely sequenced genomes. The query interface, a comparative genome browser, enables to navigate between genome dotplots, comparative maps and sequence alignments. The Narcisse database can be accessed at http://narcisse.toulouse.inra.fr . 
 The Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN, http://zfin.org ), the model organism database for zebrafish, provides the central location for curated zebrafish genetic, genomic and developmental data. Extensive data integration of mutant phenotypes, genes, expression patterns, sequences, genetic markers, morpholinos, map positions, publications and community resources facilitates the use of the zebrafish as a model for studying gene function, development, behavior and disease. Access to ZFIN data is provided via web-based query forms and through bulk data files. ZFIN is the definitive source for zebrafish gene and allele nomenclature, the zebrafish anatomical ontology (AO) and for zebrafish gene ontology (GO) annotations. ZFIN plays an active role in the development of cross-species ontologies such as the phenotypic quality ontology (PATO) and the gene ontology (GO). Recent enhancements to ZFIN include (i) a new home page and navigation bar, (ii) expanded support for genotypes and phenotypes, (iii) comprehensive phenotype annotations based on anatomical, phenotypic quality and gene ontologies, (iv) a BLAST server tightly integrated with the ZFIN database via ZFIN-specific datasets, (v) a global site search and (vi) help with hands-on resources. 
 We present a new database of computational hot spots in protein interfaces: HotSprint. Hot spots are residues comprising only a small fraction of interfaces yet accounting for the majority of the binding energy. HotSprint contains data for 35 776 protein interfaces among 49 512 protein interfaces extracted from the multi-chain structures in Protein Data Bank (PDB) as of February 2006. The conserved residues in interfaces with certain buried accessible solvent area (ASA) and complex ASA thresholds are flagged as computational hot spots. The predicted hot spots are observed to correlate with the experimental hot spots with an accuracy of 76%. Several machine-learning methods (SVM, Decision Trees and Decision Lists) are also applied to predict hot spots, results reveal that our empirical approach performs better than the others. A web interface for the HotSprint database allows users to browse and query the hot spots in protein interfaces. HotSprint is available at http://prism.ccbb.ku.edu.tr/hotsprint ; and it provides information for interface residues that are functionally and structurally important as well as the evolutionary history and solvent accessibility of residues in interfaces. 
 Structural motifs are important for the integrity of a protein fold and can be employed to design and rationalize protein engineering and folding experiments. Such conserved segments represent the conserved core of a family or superfamily and can be crucial for the recognition of potential new members in sequence and structure databases. We present a database, MegaMotifBase, that compiles a set of important structural segments or motifs for protein structures. Motifs are recognized on the basis of both sequence conservation and preservation of important structural features such as amino acid preference, solvent accessibility, secondary structural content, hydrogen-bonding pattern and residue packing. This database provides 3D orientation patterns of the identified motifs in terms of inter-motif distances and torsion angles. Important applications of structural motifs are also provided in several crucial areas such as similar sequence and structure search, multiple sequence alignment and homology modeling. MegaMotifBase can be a useful resource to gain knowledge about structure and functional relationship of proteins. The database can be accessed from the URL http://caps.ncbs.res.in/MegaMotifbase/index.html
 Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that extends DNA at the chromosome ends in most eukaryotes. Since 1985, telomerase has been studied intensively and components of the telomerase complex have been identified from over 160 eukaryotic species. In the last two decades, there has been a growing interest in studying telomerase owing to its vital role in chromosome stability and cellular immortality. To keep up with the remarkable explosion of knowledge about telomerase, we compiled information related to telomerase in an exhaustive database called the Telomerase Database ( http://telomerase.asu.edu/ ). The Telomerase Database provides comprehensive information about (i) sequences of the RNA and protein subunits of telomerase, (ii) sequence alignments based on the phylogenetic relationship and structure, (iii) secondary structures of the RNA component and tertiary structures of various subunits of telomerase, (iv) mutations of telomerase components found in human patients and (v) active researchers who contributed to the wealth of current knowledge on telomerase. The information is hierarchically organized by the components, i.e. the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), telomerase RNA (TR) and other telomerase-associated proteins. The Telomerase Database is a useful resource especially for researchers who are interested in investigating the structure, function, evolution and medical relevance of the telomerase enzyme. 
 TreeFam ( http://www.treefam.org ) was developed to provide curated phylogenetic trees for all animal gene families, as well as orthologue and paralogue assignments. Release 4.0 of TreeFam contains curated trees for 1314 families and automatically generated trees for another 14 351 families. We have expanded TreeFam to include 25 fully sequenced animal genomes, as well as four genomes from plant and fungal outgroup species. We have also introduced more accurate approaches for automatically grouping genes into families, for building phylogenetic trees, and for inferring orthologues and paralogues. The user interface for viewing phylogenetic trees and family information has been improved. Furthermore, a new perl API lets users easily extract data from the TreeFam mysql database. 
 MicroRNA.org ( http://www.microrna.org ) is a comprehensive resource of microRNA target predictions and expression profiles. Target predictions are based on a development of the miRanda algorithm which incorporates current biological knowledge on target rules and on the use of an up-to-date compendium of mammalian microRNAs. MicroRNA expression profiles are derived from a comprehensive sequencing project of a large set of mammalian tissues and cell lines of normal and disease origin. Using an improved graphical interface, a user can explore (i) the set of genes that are potentially regulated by a particular microRNA, (ii) the implied cooperativity of multiple microRNAs on a particular mRNA and (iii) microRNA expression profiles in various tissues. To facilitate future updates and development, the microRNA.org database structure and software architecture is flexibly designed to incorporate new expression and target discoveries. The web resource provides users with functional information about the growing number of microRNAs and their interaction with target genes in many species and facilitates novel discoveries in microRNA gene regulation. 
 The web-based RESP ESP charge DataBase (R.E.DD.B., http://q4md-forcefieldtools.org/REDDB ) is a free and new source of RESP and ESP atomic charge values and force field libraries for model systems and/or small molecules. R.E.DD.B. stores highly effective and reproducible charge values and molecular structures in the Tripos mol2 file format, information about the charge derivation procedure, scripts to integrate the charges and molecular topology in the most common molecular dynamics packages. Moreover, R.E.DD.B. allows users to freely store and distribute RESP or ESP charges and force field libraries to the scientific community, via a web interface. The first version of R.E.DD.B., released in January 2006, contains force field libraries for molecules as well as molecular fragments for standard residues and their analogs (amino acids, monosaccharides, nucleotides and ligands), hence covering a vast area of relevant biological applications. 
 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an important class of regulators that are involved in various cellular and disease processes. However, the functional significance of each miRNA is mostly unknown due to the difficulty in identifying target genes and the lack of genome-wide expression data combining miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins. We introduce a novel database, miRGator , that integrates the target prediction, functional analysis, gene expression data and genome annotation. MiRNA function is inferred from the list of target genes predicted by miRanda , PicTar and TargetScanS programs. Statistical enrichment test of target genes in each term is performed for gene ontology, pathway and disease annotations. Associated terms may provide valuable insights for the function of each miRNA. For the expression analysis, miRGator integrates public expression data of miRNA with those of mRNA and protein. Expression correlation between miRNA and target mRNA/proteins is evaluated and their expression patterns can be readily compared. Our web implementation supports diverse query types including miRNA name, gene symbol, gene ontology, pathway and disease terms. Interfaces for exploring common targets or regulatory miRNAs and for profiling compendium expression data have been developed as well. Currently, miRGator , available at: http://genome.ewha.ac.kr/miRGator/, supports the human and mouse genomes. 
 DOMINE is a database of known and predicted protein domain interactions compiled from a variety of sources. The database contains domain–domain interactions observed in PDB entries, and those that were predicted by eight different computational approaches. DOMINE contains a total of 20 513 unique domain–domain interactions among 4036 Pfam domains, out of which 4349 are inferred from PDB entries and 17 781 were predicted by at least one computational approach. This database will serve as a valuable resource to those working in the field of protein and domain interactions. DOMINE may not only serve as a reference to experimentalists who test for new protein and domain interactions, but also offers a consolidated dataset for analysis by bioinformaticians who seek to test ideas regarding the underlying factors that control the topological structure of interaction networks. DOMINE is freely available at http://domine.utdallas.edu . 
 Here we report the new features and improvements in our latest release of the H-Invitational Database (H-InvDB; http://www.h-invitational.jp/ ), a comprehensive annotation resource for human genes and transcripts. H-InvDB, originally developed as an integrated database of the human transcriptome based on extensive annotation of large sets of full-length cDNA (FLcDNA) clones, now provides annotation for 120 558 human mRNAs extracted from the International Nucleotide Sequence Databases (INSD), in addition to 54 978 human FLcDNAs, in the latest release H-InvDB_4.6. We mapped those human transcripts onto the human genome sequences (NCBI build 36.1) and determined 34 699 human gene clusters, which could define 34 057 (98.1%) protein-coding and 642 (1.9%) non-protein-coding loci; 858 (2.5%) transcribed loci overlapped with predicted pseudogenes. For all these transcripts and genes, we provide comprehensive annotation including gene structures, gene functions, alternative splicing variants, functional non-protein-coding RNAs, functional domains, predicted sub cellular localizations, metabolic pathways, predictions of protein 3D structure, mapping of SNPs and microsatellite repeat motifs, co-localization with orphan diseases, gene expression profiles, orthologous genes, protein–protein interactions (PPI) and annotation for gene families. The current H-InvDB annotation resources consist of two main views: Transcript view and Locus view and eight sub-databases: the DiseaseInfo Viewer, H-ANGEL, the Clustering Viewer, G-integra, the TOPO Viewer, Evola, the PPI view and the Gene family/group. 
 Glycobiology has been brought to public attention as a frontier in the post-genomic era. Structural information about glycans has been accumulating in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for years. It has been recognized, however, that there are many questionable glycan models in the PDB. A tool for verifying the primary structures of glycan 3D structures is evidently required, yet there have been no such publicly available tools. The Glycoconjugate Data Bank:Structures (GDB:Structures, http://www.glycostructures.jp ) is an annotated glycan structure database, which also provides an N -glycan primary structure (or glycoform) verification service. All the glycan 3D structures are detected and annotated by an in-house program named ‘getCARBO’. When an N -glycan is detected in a query coordinate by getCARBO, the primary structure of the glycan is compared with the most similar entry in the glycan primary structure database (KEGG GLYCAN), and unmatched substructure(s) are indicated if observed. The results of getCARBO are stored and presented in GDB:Structures. 
 The Yeast search for transcriptional regulators and consensus tracking (YEASTRACT) information system ( www.yeastract.com ) was developed to support the analysis of transcription regulatory associations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Last updated in September 2007, this database contains over 30 990 regulatory associations between Transcription Factors (TFs) and target genes and includes 284 specific DNA binding sites for 108 characterized TFs. Computational tools are also provided to facilitate the exploitation of the gathered data when solving a number of biological questions, in particular the ones that involve the analysis of global gene expression results. In this new release, YEASTRACT includes DISCOVERER, a set of computational tools that can be used to identify complex motifs over-represented in the promoter regions of co-regulated genes. The motifs identified are then clustered in families, represented by a position weight matrix and are automatically compared with the known transcription factor binding sites described in YEASTRACT. Additionally, in this new release, it is possible to generate graphic depictions of transcriptional regulatory networks for documented or potential regulatory associations between TFs and target genes. The visual display of these networks of interactions is instrumental in functional studies. Tutorials are available on the system to exemplify the use of all the available tools. 
The Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB; wwpdb.org) is the international collaboration that manages the deposition, processing and distribution of the PDB archive. The online PDB archive at ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org is the repository for the coordinates and related information for more than 47 000 structures, including proteins, nucleic acids and large macromolecular complexes that have been determined using X-ray crystallography, NMR and electron microscopy techniques. The members of the wwPDB–RCSB PDB (USA), MSD-EBI (Europe), PDBj (Japan) and BMRB (USA)–have remediated this archive to address inconsistencies that have been introduced over the years. The scope and methods used in this project are presented.
 We have developed a comprehensive resource devoted to biologists wanting to optimize the use of gene trap clones in their experiments. We have processed 300 602 such clones from both public and private projects to generate 28 199 ‘UniTraps’, i.e. distinct collections of unambiguous insertions at the same subgenic region of annotated genes. The UniTrap resource contains data relative to 9583 trapped genes, which represent 42.3% of the mouse gene content. Among the trapped genes, 7 728 have a counterpart in humans, and 677 are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases. The aim of this analysis is to provide the wet lab researchers with a comprehensive database and curated tools for (i) identifying and comparing the clones carrying a trap into the genes of interest, (ii) evaluating the severity of the mutation to the protein function in each independent trapping event and (iii) supplying complete information to perform PCR, RT-PCR and restriction experiments to verify the clone and identify the exact point of vector insertion. To share this unique resource with the scientific community, we have designed and implemented a web interface that is freely accessible at http://unitrap.cbm.fvg.it/ . 
 Pfam is a comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile hidden Markov models. The current release of Pfam (22.0) contains 9318 protein families. Pfam is now based not only on the UniProtKB sequence database, but also on NCBI GenPept and on sequences from selected metagenomics projects. Pfam is available on the web from the consortium members using a new, consistent and improved website design in the UK ( http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ ), the USA ( http://pfam.janelia.org/ ) and Sweden ( http://pfam.sbc.su.se/ ), as well as from mirror sites in France ( http://pfam.jouy.inra.fr/ ) and South Korea ( http://pfam.ccbb.re.kr/ ). 
One of the first specialized collections of nucleic acid sequences in life sciences was the ‘compilation of tRNA sequences and sequences of tRNA genes’ (http://www.trna.uni-bayreuth.de). Here, an updated and completely restructured version of this compilation is presented (http://trnadb.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de). The new database, tRNAdb, is hosted and maintained in cooperation between the universities of Leipzig, Marburg, and Strasbourg. Reimplemented as a relational database, tRNAdb will be updated periodically and is searchable in a highly flexible and user-friendly way. Currently, it contains more than 12 000 tRNA genes, classified into families according to amino acid specificity. Furthermore, the implementation of the NCBI taxonomy tree facilitates phylogeny-related queries. The database provides various services including graphical representations of tRNA secondary structures, a customizable output of aligned or un-aligned sequences with a variety of individual and combinable search criteria, as well as the construction of consensus sequences for any selected set of tRNAs.
The UniPROBE (Universal PBM Resource for Oligonucleotide Binding Evaluation) database hosts data generated by universal protein binding microarray (PBM) technology on the in vitro DNA-binding specificities of proteins. This initial release of the UniPROBE database provides a centralized resource for accessing comprehensive PBM data on the preferences of proteins for all possible sequence variants (‘words’) of length k (‘k-mers’), as well as position weight matrix (PWM) and graphical sequence logo representations of the k-mer data. In total, the database hosts DNA-binding data for over 175 nonredundant proteins from a diverse collection of organisms, including the prokaryote Vibrio harveyi, the eukaryotic malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the parasitic Apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, mouse and human. Current web tools include a text-based search, a function for assessing motif similarity between user-entered data and database PWMs, and a function for locating putative binding sites along user-entered nucleotide sequences. The UniPROBE database is available at http://thebrain.bwh.harvard.edu/uniprobe/.
The BPS (http://bps.rutgers.edu) is a database of RNA base-pair structures, higher-order base interactions and isosteric pairs (base pairs with similar shape). The main functions of the BPS are to find and annotate the structural and chemical features of the Watson–Crick and non-Watson–Crick (noncanonical) base pairs in high-resolution RNA structures, and to provide a user-friendly interface to browse and search for the base pairs. The current database contains 91 265 bp and 3386 higher-order base interactions from 426 RNA crystal structures and 61 819 bp that fall into one of 17 different isosteric classes. The base-pair data can be accessed by searches of base-pair patterns, structure identifiers (IDs) and structural types. The BPS also includes an Atlas with representative images of the various base pairs, higher-order base interactions and isosteric pairs and links to statistical information about these groups of structures.
The BRENDA (BRaunschweig ENzyme DAtabase) (http://www.brenda-enzymes.org) represents the largest freely available information system containing a huge amount of biochemical and molecular information on all classified enzymes as well as software tools for querying the database and calculating molecular properties. The database covers information on classification and nomenclature, reaction and specificity, functional parameters, occurrence, enzyme structure and stability, mutants and enzyme engineering, preparation and isolation, the application of enzymes, and ligand-related data. The data in BRENDA are manually curated from more than 79 000 primary literature references. Each entry is clearly linked to a literature reference, the origin organism and, where available, to the protein sequence of the enzyme protein. A new search option provides the access to protein-specific data. FRENDA (Full Reference ENzyme DAta) and AMENDA (Automatic Mining of ENzyme DAta) are additional databases created by continuously improved text-mining procedures. These databases ought to provide a complete survey on enzyme data of the literature collection of PubMed. The web service via a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) interface for access to the BRENDA data has been further enhanced.
The Human Genome Variation database of Genotype to Phenotype information (HGVbaseG2P) is a new central database for summary-level findings produced by human genetic association studies, both large and small. Such a database is needed so that researchers have an easy way to access all the available association study data relevant to their genes, genome regions or diseases of interest. Such a depository will allow true positive signals to be more readily distinguished from false positives (type I error) that fail to consistently replicate. In this paper we describe how HGVbaseG2P has been constructed, and how its data are gathered and organized. We present a range of user-friendly but powerful website tools for searching, browsing and visualizing G2P study findings. HGVbaseG2P is available at http://www.hgvbaseg2p.org.
The latest version of CATH (class, architecture, topology, homology) (version 3.2), released in July 2008 (http://www.cathdb.info), contains 1 14 215 domains, 2178 Homologous superfamilies and 1110 fold groups. We have assigned 20 330 new domains, 87 new homologous superfamilies and 26 new folds since CATH release version 3.1. A total of 28 064 new domains have been assigned since our NAR 2007 database publication (CATH version 3.0). The CATH website has been completely redesigned and includes more comprehensive documentation. We have revisited the CATH architecture level as part of the development of a ‘Protein Chart’ and present information on the population of each architecture. The CATHEDRAL structure comparison algorithm has been improved and used to characterize structural diversity in CATH superfamilies and structural overlaps between superfamilies. Although the majority of superfamilies in CATH are not structurally diverse and do not overlap significantly with other superfamilies, ∼4% of superfamilies are very diverse and these are the superfamilies that are most highly populated in both the PDB and in the genomes. Information on the degree of structural diversity in each superfamily and structural overlaps between superfamilies can now be downloaded from the CATH website.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a well-studied opportunistic pathogen that is particularly known for its intrinsic antimicrobial resistance, diverse metabolic capacity, and its ability to cause life threatening infections in cystic fibrosis patients. The Pseudomonas Genome Database (http://www.pseudomonas.com) was originally developed as a resource for peer-reviewed, continually updated annotation for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 reference strain genome. In order to facilitate cross-strain and cross-species genome comparisons with other Pseudomonas species of importance, we have now expanded the database capabilities to include all Pseudomonas species, and have developed or incorporated methods to facilitate high quality comparative genomics. The database contains robust assessment of orthologs, a novel ortholog clustering method, and incorporates five views of the data at the sequence and annotation levels (Gbrowse, Mauve and custom views) to facilitate genome comparisons. A choice of simple and more flexible user-friendly Boolean search features allows researchers to search and compare annotations or sequences within or between genomes. Other features include more accurate protein subcellular localization predictions and a user-friendly, Boolean searchable log file of updates for the reference strain PAO1. This database aims to continue to provide a high quality, annotated genome resource for the research community and is available under an open source license.
Human protein interaction maps have become important tools of biomedical research for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms and the identification of new modulators of disease processes. The Unified Human Interactome database (UniHI, http://www.unihi.org) provides researchers with a comprehensive platform to query and access human protein–protein interaction (PPI) data. Since its first release, UniHI has considerably increased in size. The latest update of UniHI includes over 250 000 interactions between ∼22 300 unique proteins collected from 14 major PPI sources. However, this wealth of data also poses new challenges for researchers due to the complexity of interaction networks retrieved from the database. We therefore developed several new tools to query, analyze and visualize human PPI networks. Most importantly, UniHI allows now the construction of tissue-specific interaction networks and focused querying of canonical pathways. This will enable researchers to target their analysis and to prioritize candidate proteins for follow-up studies.
MODBASE (http://salilab.org/modbase) is a database of annotated comparative protein structure models. The models are calculated by MODPIPE, an automated modeling pipeline that relies primarily on MODELLER for fold assignment, sequence–structure alignment, model building and model assessment (http:/salilab.org/modeller). MODBASE currently contains 5 152 695 reliable models for domains in 1 593 209 unique protein sequences; only models based on statistically significant alignments and/or models assessed to have the correct fold are included. MODBASE also allows users to calculate comparative models on demand, through an interface to the MODWEB modeling server (http://salilab.org/modweb). Other resources integrated with MODBASE include databases of multiple protein structure alignments (DBAli), structurally defined ligand binding sites (LIGBASE), predicted ligand binding sites (AnnoLyze), structurally defined binary domain interfaces (PIBASE) and annotated single nucleotide polymorphisms and somatic mutations found in human proteins (LS-SNP, LS-Mut). MODBASE models are also available through the Protein Model Portal (http://www.proteinmodelportal.org/).
Over the last decade rapid progress has been made in the study of ethanol-related traits including alcohol abuse and dependence, and behavioral responses to ethanol in both humans and animal models. To collect, curate, integrate these results so as to make them easily accessible and interpretable for researchers, we developed ERGR, a comprehensive ethanol-related gene resource. We collected and curated more than 30 large-scale data sets including linkage, association and microarray gene expression from the literature and 21 mouse QTLs from public databases. At present, the ERGR deposits ethanol-related information of ∼7000 genes from five organisms: human (3311), mouse (2129), rat (679), fly (614) and worm (228). ERGR provides gene annotations and orthologs, detailed gene study information (e.g. fold changes of gene expression, P-values), and both the text and BLAST searches. Moreover, ERGR has data integration tools such as for data union and intersection, and candidate gene selection based on evidence in multiple datasets or organisms. The ERGR database is evolving with new data releases. More functions will also be added. ERGR has a user-friendly web interface with browse and search functions at multiple levels. It is freely available at http://bioinfo.vipbg.vcu.edu/ERGR/.
The RNA Virus Database is a database and web application describing the genome organization and providing analytical tools for the 938 known species of RNA virus. It can identify submitted nucleotide sequences, can place them into multiple whole-genome alignments (in species where more than one isolate has been fully sequenced) and contains translated genome sequences for all species. It has been created for two main purposes: to facilitate the comparative analysis of RNA viruses and to become a hub for other, more specialised virus Web sites. It is available at the following four mirrored sites. http://virus.zoo.ox.ac.uk/rnavirusdbhttp://hivweb.sanbi.ac.za/rnavirusdbhttp://bioinf.cs.auckland.ac.nz/rnavirusdbhttp://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/rnavirusdb
The Proteolysis MAP (PMAP, http://www.proteolysis.org) is a user-friendly website intended to aid the scientific community in reasoning about proteolytic networks and pathways. PMAP is comprised of five databases, linked together in one environment. The foundation databases, ProteaseDB and SubstrateDB, are driven by an automated annotation pipeline that generates dynamic ‘Molecule Pages’, rich in molecular information. PMAP also contains two community annotated databases focused on function; CutDB has information on more than 5000 proteolytic events, and ProfileDB is dedicated to information of the substrate recognition specificity of proteases. Together, the content within these four databases will ultimately feed PathwayDB, which will be comprised of known pathways whose function can be dynamically modeled in a rule-based manner, and hypothetical pathways suggested by semi-automated culling of the literature. A Protease Toolkit is also available for the analysis of proteases and proteolysis. Here, we describe how the databases of PMAP can be used to foster understanding of proteolytic pathways, and equally as significant, to reason about proteolysis.
Volatiles are efficient mediators of chemical communication acting universally as attractant, repellent or warning signal in all kingdoms of life. Beside this broad impact volatiles have in nature, scents are also widely used in pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries, so the identification of new scents is of great industrial interest. Despite this importance as well as the vast number and diversity of volatile compounds, there is currently no comprehensive public database providing information on structure and chemical classification of volatiles. Therefore, the database SuperScent was established to supply users with detailed information on the variety of odor components. The version of the database presented here comprises the 2D/3D structures of approximately 2100 volatiles and around 9200 synonyms as well as physicochemical properties, commercial availability and references. The volatiles are classified according to their origin, functionality and odorant groups. The information was extracted from the literature and web resources. SuperScent offers several search options, e.g. name, Pubchem ID number, species, functional groups, or molecular weight. SuperScent is available online at: http://bioinformatics.charite.de/superscent.
VectorBase (http://www.vectorbase.org) is an NIAID-funded Bioinformatic Resource Center focused on invertebrate vectors of human pathogens. VectorBase annotates and curates vector genomes providing a web accessible integrated resource for the research community. Currently, VectorBase contains genome information for three mosquito species: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus, a body louse Pediculus humanus and a tick species Ixodes scapularis. Since our last report VectorBase has initiated a community annotation system, a microarray and gene expression repository and controlled vocabularies for anatomy and insecticide resistance. We have continued to develop both the software infrastructure and tools for interrogating the stored data.
Genome wide scans have shown that positive selection is relatively frequent at the molecular level. It is of special interest to identify which protein sites and which phylogenetic branches are affected. We present Selectome, a database which provides the results of a rigorous branch-site specific likelihood test for positive selection. The Web interface presents test results mapped both onto phylogenetic trees and onto protein alignments. It allows rapid access to results by keyword, gene name, or taxonomy based queries. Selectome is freely available at http://bioinfo.unil.ch/selectome/.
Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) represent the single largest, best-understood class of non-protein coding RNA genes found in all living organisms. By far, the major source of new tRNAs is computational identification of genes within newly sequenced genomes. To organize the rapidly growing collection and enable systematic analyses, we created the Genomic tRNA Database (GtRNAdb), currently including over 74 000 tRNA genes predicted from 740 species. The web resource provides overview statistics of tRNA genes within each analyzed genome, including information by isotype and genetic locus, easily downloadable primary sequences, graphical secondary structures and multiple sequence alignments. Direct links for each gene to UCSC eukaryotic and microbial genome browsers provide graphical display of tRNA genes in the context of all other local genetic information. The database can be searched by primary sequence similarity, tRNA characteristics or phylogenetic group. The database is publicly available at http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu.
The treatment of infections is increasingly compromised by the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics through mutations or through the acquisition of resistance genes. Antibiotic resistance genes also have the potential to be used for bio-terror purposes through genetically modified organisms. In order to facilitate the identification and characterization of these genes, we have created a manually curated database—the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB)—unifying most of the publicly available information on antibiotic resistance. Each gene and resistance type is annotated with rich information, including resistance profile, mechanism of action, ontology, COG and CDD annotations, as well as external links to sequence and protein databases. Our database also supports sequence similarity searches and implements an initial version of a tool for characterizing common mutations that confer antibiotic resistance. The information we provide can be used as compendium of antibiotic resistance factors as well as to identify the resistance genes of newly sequenced genes, genomes, or metagenomes. Currently, ARDB contains resistance information for 13 293 genes, 377 types, 257 antibiotics, 632 genomes, 933 species and 124 genera. ARDB is available at http://ardb.cbcb.umd.edu/.
Nematode.net (http://nematode.net) is a publicly available resource dedicated to the study of parasitic nematodes. In 2000, the Genome Center at Washington University (GC) joined a consortium including the Nematode Genomics group in Edinburgh, and the Pathogen Sequencing Unit of the Sanger Institute to generate expressed sequence tags (ESTs) as an inexpensive and efficient solution for gene discovery in parasitic nematodes. As of 2008 the GC, sampling key parasites of humans, animals and plants, has generated over 500 000 ESTs and 1.2 million genome survey sequences from more than 30 non-Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. Nematode.net was implemented to offer user-friendly access to data produced by this project. In addition to sequence data, the site hosts: assembled NemaGene clusters in GBrowse views characterizing composition and protein homology, functional Gene Ontology annotations presented via the AmiGO browser, KEGG-based graphical display of NemaGene clusters mapped to metabolic pathways, codon usage tables, NemFam protein families which represent conserved nematode-restricted coding sequences not found in public protein databases, a web-based WU-BLAST search tool that allows complex querying and other assorted resources. The primary aim of Nematode.net is the dissemination of this diverse collection of information to the broader scientific community in a way that is useful, consistent, centralized and enduring.
In mammals, thousands of long non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (>200 nt) have recently been described. However, the biological significance and function of the vast majority of these transcripts remain unclear. We have constructed a public repository, the Noncoding RNA Expression Database (NRED), which provides gene expression information for thousands of long ncRNAs in human and mouse. The database contains both microarray and in situ hybridization data, much of which is described here for the first time. NRED also supplies a rich tapestry of ancillary information for featured ncRNAs, including evolutionary conservation, secondary structure evidence, genomic context links and antisense relationships. The database is available at http://jsm-research.imb.uq.edu.au/NRED, and the web interface enables both advanced searches and data downloads. Taken together, NRED should significantly advance the study and understanding of long ncRNAs, and provides a timely and valuable resource to the scientific community.
SPROUTS (Structural Prediction for pRotein fOlding UTility System) is a new database that provides access to various structural data sets and integrated functionalities not yet available to the community. The originality of the SPROUTS database is the ability to gain access to a variety of structural analyses at one place and with a strong interaction between them. SPROUTS currently combines data pertaining to 429 structures that capture representative folds and results related to the prediction of critical residues expected to belong to the folding nucleus: the MIR (Most Interacting Residues), the description of the structures in terms of modular fragments: the TEF (Tightened End Fragments), and the calculation at each position of the free energy change gradient upon mutation by one of the 19 amino acids. All database results can be displayed and downloaded in textual files and Excel spreadsheets and visualized on the protein structure. SPROUTS is a unique resource to access as well as visualize state-of-the-art characteristics of protein folding and analyse the effect of point mutations on protein structure. It is available at http://bioinformatics.eas.asu.edu/sprouts.html.
‘Cell adhesion molecules’ (CAMs) are essential elements of cell/cell communication that are important for proper development and plasticity of a variety of organs and tissues. In the brain, appropriate assembly and tuning of neuronal connections is likely to require appropriate function of many cell adhesion processes. Genetic studies have linked and/or associated CAM variants with psychiatric, neurologic, neoplastic, immunologic and developmental phenotypes. However, despite increasing recognition of their functional and pathological significance, no systematic study has enumerated CAMs or documented their global features. We now report compilation of 496 human CAM genes in six gene families based on manual curation of protein domain structures, Gene Ontology annotations, and 1487 NCBI Entrez annotations. We map these genes onto a cell adhesion molecule ontology that contains 850 terms, up to seven levels of depth and provides a hierarchical description of these molecules and their functions. We develop OKCAM, a CAM knowledgebase that provides ready access to these data and ontologic system at http://okcam.cbi.pku.edu.cn. We identify global CAM properties that include: (i) functional enrichment, (ii) over-represented regulation modes and expression patterns and (iii) relationships to human Mendelian and complex diseases, and discuss the strengths and limitations of these data.
The packing of protein atoms is an indicator for their stability and functionality, and applied in determining thermostability, in protein design, ligand binding and to identify flexible regions in proteins. Here, we present Voronoia, a database of atomic-scale packing data for protein 3D structures. It is based on an improved Voronoi Cell algorithm using hyperboloid interfaces to construct atomic volumes, and to resolve solvent-accessible and -inaccessible regions of atoms. The database contains atomic volumes, local packing densities and interior cavities calculated for 61 318 biological units from the PDB. A report for each structure summarizes the packing by residue and atom types, and lists the environment of interior cavities. The packing data are compared to a nonredundant set of structures from SCOP superfamilies. Both packing densities and cavities can be visualized in the 3D structures by the Jmol plugin. Additionally, PDB files can be submitted to the Voronoia server for calculation. This service performs calculations for most full-atomic protein structures within a few minutes. For batch jobs, a standalone version of the program with an optional PyMOL plugin is available for download. The database can be freely accessed at: http://bioinformatics.charite.de/voronoia.
Full-Malaria/Parasites is a database for transcriptome studies of apicomplexa and other parasites, which is based on our original full-length cDNA sequences and physical cDNA clone resources. In this update, the database has been expanded to contain the shogun sequencing for the entire sequences of 14 818 non-redundant full-length cDNA clones from six apicomplexa parasites and 6.8 million of transcription start sites (TSS), both of which had been produced by novel protocols using the oligo-capping method and the Illumina GA sequencer. The former should be the ultimate data for exact annotation of the expressed genes, while the latter should be useful for ultra-deep expression analysis. Furthermore, we have launched Full-Arthropods, a full-length cDNA database for arthropods of medical importance. Full-Arthropods contains 50 343 one-pass sequences, 10 399 shotgun complete sequences and 22.4 million TSS tags in anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria, tsetse flies that transmit trypanosomiasis and dust mites that cause allergic dermatitis and bronchial asthma. By providing the largest integrated full-length cDNA data resources in the apicomplexa parasites as well as their vectors, Full-Malaria/Parasites and Full-Arthropods should help combat parasitic diseases. Full-Malaria/Parasites and Full-Arthropods are accessible from http://fullmal.hgc.jp/.
MachiBase (http://machibase.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) provides a comprehensive and freely accessible resource regarding Drosophila melanogaster 5′-end mRNA transcription at different developmental states, supporting studies on the variabilities of promoter transcriptional activities and gene-expression profiles in the fruitfly. The data were generated in conjunction with the recently developed high-throughput genome sequencer Illumina/Solexa using a newly developed 5′-end mRNA collection method.
The IUPHAR database (IUPHAR-DB) integrates peer-reviewed pharmacological, chemical, genetic, functional and anatomical information on the 354 nonsensory G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 71 ligand-gated ion channel subunits and 141 voltage-gated-like ion channel subunits encoded by the human, rat and mouse genomes. These genes represent the targets of approximately one-third of currently approved drugs and are a major focus of drug discovery and development programs in the pharmaceutical industry. IUPHAR-DB provides a comprehensive description of the genes and their functions, with information on protein structure and interactions, ligands, expression patterns, signaling mechanisms, functional assays and biologically important receptor variants (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms and splice variants). In addition, the phenotypes resulting from altered gene expression (e.g. in genetically altered animals or in human genetic disorders) are described. The content of the database is peer reviewed by members of the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification (NC-IUPHAR); the data are provided through manual curation of the primary literature by a network of over 60 subcommittees of NC-IUPHAR. Links to other bioinformatics resources, such as NCBI, Uniprot, HGNC and the rat and mouse genome databases are provided. IUPHAR-DB is freely available at http://www.iuphar-db.org.
RNAi-based gene-silencing techniques offer a fast and cost-effective way of knocking down genes’ functions in an easily regulated manner. Exciting progress has been made in recent years in the application of these techniques in basic biomedical research and therapeutic development. However, it remains a difficult task to design effective siRNA experiments with high efficacy and specificity. We present siRecords, an extensive database of mammalian RNAi experiments with consistent efficacy ratings. This database serves two purposes. First, it provides a large and diverse dataset of siRNA experiments. This dataset faithfully represents the general, diverse RNAi experimental practice, and allows more reliable siRNA design tools to be developed with the overfitting problem well curbed. Second, the database helps experimental RNAi researchers directly by providing them with the efficacy and other information about the siRNAs experiments designed and conducted previously against the genes of their interest. The current release of siRecords contains the records of 17 192 RNAi experiments targeting 5086 genes.
The Protein Structure Initiative Structural Genomics Knowledgebase (PSI SGKB, http://kb.psi-structuralgenomics.org) has been created to turn the products of the PSI structural genomics effort into knowledge that can be used by the biological research community to understand living systems and disease. This resource provides central access to structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), along with functional annotations, associated homology models, worldwide protein target tracking information, available protocols and the potential to obtain DNA materials for many of the targets. It also offers the ability to search all of the structural and methodological publications and the innovative technologies that were catalyzed by the PSI's high-throughput research efforts. In collaboration with the Nature Publishing Group, the PSI SGKB provides a research library, editorials about new research advances, news and an events calendar to present a broader view of structural biology and structural genomics. By making these resources freely available, the PSI SGKB serves as a bridge to connect the structural biology and the greater biomedical communities.
VIPERdb (http://viperdb.scripps.edu) is a relational database and a web portal for icosahedral virus capsid structures. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive resource specific to the needs of the virology community, with an emphasis on the description and comparison of derived data from structural and computational analyses of the virus capsids. In the current release, VIPERdb2, we implemented a useful and novel method to represent capsid protein residues in the icosahedral asymmetric unit (IAU) using azimuthal polar orthographic projections, otherwise known as Φ–Ψ (Phi–Psi) diagrams. In conjunction with a new Application Programming Interface (API), these diagrams can be used as a dynamic interface to the database to map residues (categorized as surface, interface and core residues) and identify family wide conserved residues including hotspots at the interfaces. Additionally, we enhanced the interactivity with the database by interfacing with web-based tools. In particular, the applications Jmol and STRAP were implemented to visualize and interact with the virus molecular structures and provide sequence–structure alignment capabilities. Together with extended curation practices that maintain data uniformity, a relational database implementation based on a schema for macromolecular structures and the APIs provided will greatly enhance the ability to do structural bioinformatics analysis of virus capsids.
PRODORIC is a database that provides annotated information on the regulation of gene expression in prokaryotes. It integrates a large compilation of gene regulatory data including transcription factor binding sites, promoter structures and gene expression patterns. The whole dataset is manually curated and relies on published results extracted from the scientific literature. The current extended version of PRODORIC contains gene regulatory data for several new microorganisms. Major improvements were realized in the design of the web interface and the accessibility of the stored information. The database was further improved by the implementation of various new tools for the elucidation of gene regulatory interactions. Thus, the PRODORIC platform represents a framework for the interactive exploration, prediction and evaluation of gene regulatory networks in prokaryotes. PRODORIC is accessible at http://www.prodoric.de.
The ‘Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1), Human Protein Interaction Database’, available through the National Library of Medicine at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/HIVInteractions, was created to catalog all interactions between HIV-1 and human proteins published in the peer-reviewed literature. The database serves the scientific community exploring the discovery of novel HIV vaccine candidates and therapeutic targets. To facilitate this discovery approach, the following information for each HIV-1 human protein interaction is provided and can be retrieved without restriction by web-based downloads and ftp protocols: Reference Sequence (RefSeq) protein accession numbers, Entrez Gene identification numbers, brief descriptions of the interactions, searchable keywords for interactions and PubMed identification numbers (PMIDs) of journal articles describing the interactions. Currently, 2589 unique HIV-1 to human protein interactions and 5135 brief descriptions of the interactions, with a total of 14 312 PMID references to the original articles reporting the interactions, are stored in this growing database. In addition, all protein–protein interactions documented in the database are integrated into Entrez Gene records and listed in the ‘HIV-1 protein interactions’ section of Entrez Gene reports. The database is also tightly linked to other databases through Entrez Gene, enabling users to search for an abundance of information related to HIV pathogenesis and replication.
PDBsum (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbsum) provides summary information about each experimentally determined structural model in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Here we describe some of its most recent features, including figures from the structure's key reference, citation data, Pfam domain diagrams, topology diagrams and protein–protein interactions. Furthermore, it now accepts users’ own PDB format files and generates a private set of analyses for each uploaded structure.
Aspergillus Genomes is a public resource for viewing annotated genes predicted by various Aspergillus sequencing projects. It has arisen from the union of two significant resources: the Aspergillus/Aspergillosis website and the Central Aspergillus Data REpository (CADRE). The former has primarily served the medical community, providing information about Aspergillus and associated diseases to medics, patients and scientists; the latter has focused on the fungal genomic community, providing a central repository for sequences and annotation extracted from Aspergillus Genomes. By merging these databases, genomes benefit from extensive cross-linking with medical information to create a unique resource, spanning genomics and clinical aspects of the genus. Aspergillus Genomes is accessible from http://www.aspergillus-genomes.org.uk.
The PEDANT genome database provides exhaustive annotation of nearly 3000 publicly available eukaryotic, eubacterial, archaeal and viral genomes with more than 4.5 million proteins by a broad set of bioinformatics algorithms. In particular, all completely sequenced genomes from the NCBI's Reference Sequence collection (RefSeq) are covered. The PEDANT processing pipeline has been sped up by an order of magnitude through the utilization of precalculated similarity information stored in the similarity matrix of proteins (SIMAP) database, making it possible to process newly sequenced genomes immediately as they become available. PEDANT is freely accessible to academic users at http://pedant.gsf.de. For programmatic access Web Services are available at http://pedant.gsf.de/webservices.jsp.
Dramatic increases in the throughput of nucleotide sequencing machines, and the promise of ever greater performance, have thrust bioinformatics into the era of petabyte-scale data sets. Sequence repositories, which provide the feed for these data sets into the worldwide computational infrastructure, are challenged by the impact of these data volumes. The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl), comprising the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database and the Ensembl Trace Archive, has identified challenges in the storage, movement, analysis, interpretation and visualization of petabyte-scale data sets. We present here our new repository for next generation sequence data, a brief summary of contents of the ENA and provide details of major developments to submission pipelines, high-throughput rule-based validation infrastructure and data integration approaches.
INTERFEROME is an open access database of types I, II and III Interferon regulated genes (http://www.interferome.org) collected from analysing expression data sets of cells treated with IFNs. This database of interferon regulated genes integrates information from high-throughput experiments with annotation, ontology, orthologue sequences from 37 species, tissue expression patterns and gene regulatory information to enable a detailed investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying IFN biology. INTERFEROME fulfils a need in infection, immunity, development and cancer research by providing computational tools to assist in identifying interferon signatures in gene lists generated by high-throughput expression technologies, and their potential molecular and biological consequences.
ConsensusPathDB is a database system for the integration of human functional interactions. Current knowledge of these interactions is dispersed in more than 200 databases, each having a specific focus and data format. ConsensusPathDB currently integrates the content of 12 different interaction databases with heterogeneous foci comprising a total of 26 133 distinct physical entities and 74 289 distinct functional interactions (protein–protein interactions, biochemical reactions, gene regulatory interactions), and covering 1738 pathways. We describe the database schema and the methods used for data integration. Furthermore, we describe the functionality of the ConsensusPathDB web interface, where users can search and visualize interaction networks, upload, modify and expand networks in BioPAX, SBML or PSI-MI format, or carry out over-representation analysis with uploaded identifier lists with respect to substructures derived from the integrated interaction network. The ConsensusPathDB database is available at: http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de
DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) collected and released 2 368 110 entries or 1 415 106 598 bases in the period from July 2007 to June 2008. The releases in this period include genome scale data of Bombyx mori, Oryzas latipes, Drosophila and Lotus japonicus. In addition, from this year we collected and released trace archive data in collaboration with National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The first release contains those of O. latipes and bacterial meta genomes in human gut. To cope with the current progress of sequencing technology, we also accepted and released more than 100 million of short reads of parasitic protozoa and their hosts that were produced by using a Solexa sequencer.
The growth in the number of completely sequenced microbial genomes (bacterial and archaeal) has generated a need for a procedure that provides UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot-quality annotation to as many protein sequences as possible. We have devised a semi-automated system, HAMAP (High-quality Automated and Manual Annotation of microbial Proteomes), that uses manually built annotation templates for protein families to propagate annotation to all members of manually defined protein families, using very strict criteria. The HAMAP system is composed of two databases, the proteome database and the family database, and of an automatic annotation pipeline. The proteome database comprises biological and sequence information for each completely sequenced microbial proteome, and it offers several tools for CDS searches, BLAST options and retrieval of specific sets of proteins. The family database currently comprises more than 1500 manually curated protein families and their annotation templates that are used to annotate proteins that belong to one of the HAMAP families. On the HAMAP website, individual sequences as well as whole genomes can be scanned against all HAMAP families. The system provides warnings for the absence of conserved amino acid residues, unusual sequence length, etc. Thanks to the implementation of HAMAP, more than 200 000 microbial proteins have been fully annotated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (HAMAP website: http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hamap).
The Mouse Phenome Database (MPD; http://www.jax.org/phenome) is an open source, web-based repository of phenotypic and genotypic data on commonly used and genetically diverse inbred strains of mice and their derivatives. MPD is also a facility for query, analysis and in silico hypothesis testing. Currently MPD contains about 1400 phenotypic measurements contributed by research teams worldwide, including phenotypes relevant to human health such as cancer susceptibility, aging, obesity, susceptibility to infectious diseases, atherosclerosis, blood disorders and neurosensory disorders. Electronic access to centralized strain data enables investigators to select optimal strains for many systems-based research applications, including physiological studies, drug and toxicology testing, modeling disease processes and complex trait analysis. The ability to select strains for specific research applications by accessing existing phenotype data can bypass the need to (re)characterize strains, precluding major investments of time and resources. This functionality, in turn, accelerates research and leverages existing community resources. Since our last NAR reporting in 2007, MPD has added more community-contributed data covering more phenotypic domains and implemented several new tools and features, including a new interactive Tool Demo available through the MPD homepage (quick link: http://phenome.jax.org/phenome/trytools).
The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB, http://www.hmdb.ca) is a richly annotated resource that is designed to address the broad needs of biochemists, clinical chemists, physicians, medical geneticists, nutritionists and members of the metabolomics community. Since its first release in 2007, the HMDB has been used to facilitate the research for nearly 100 published studies in metabolomics, clinical biochemistry and systems biology. The most recent release of HMDB (version 2.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the previous release (version 1.0). In particular, the number of fully annotated metabolite entries has grown from 2180 to more than 6800 (a 300% increase), while the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data has grown by a factor of five (from 883 to 4413). Similarly, the number of purified compounds with reference to NMR, LC-MS and GC-MS spectra has more than doubled (from 380 to more than 790 compounds). In addition to this significant expansion in database size, many new database searching tools and new data content has been added or enhanced. These include better algorithms for spectral searching and matching, more powerful chemical substructure searches, faster text searching software, as well as dedicated pathway searching tools and customized, clickable metabolic maps. Changes to the user-interface have also been implemented to accommodate future expansion and to make database navigation much easier. These improvements should make the HMDB much more useful to a much wider community of users.
Pseudoknots have been recognized to be an important type of RNA secondary structures responsible for many biological functions. PseudoBase, a widely used database of pseudoknot secondary structures developed at Leiden University, contains over 250 records of pseudoknots obtained in the past 25 years through crystallography, NMR, mutational experiments and sequence comparisons. To promptly address the growing analysis requests of the researchers on RNA structures and bring together information from multiple sources across the Internet to a single platform, we designed and implemented PseudoBase++, an extension of PseudoBase for easy searching, formatting and visualization of pseudoknots. PseudoBase++ (http://pseudobaseplusplus.utep.edu) maps the PseudoBase dataset into a searchable relational database including additional functionalities such as pseudoknot type. PseudoBase++ links each pseudoknot in PseudoBase to the GenBank record of the corresponding nucleotide sequence and allows scientists to automatically visualize RNA secondary structures with PseudoViewer. It also includes the capabilities of fine-grained reference searching and collecting new pseudoknot information.
Understanding the consequences on host physiology induced by viral infection requires complete understanding of the perturbations caused by virus proteins on the cellular protein interaction network. The VirusMINT database (http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/virusmint/) aims at collecting all protein interactions between viral and human proteins reported in the literature. VirusMINT currently stores over 5000 interactions involving more than 490 unique viral proteins from more than 110 different viral strains. The whole data set can be easily queried through the search pages and the results can be displayed with a graphical viewer. The curation effort has focused on manuscripts reporting interactions between human proteins and proteins encoded by some of the most medically relevant viruses: papilloma viruses, human immunodeficiency virus 1, Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes viruses and Simian virus 40.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of small noncoding RNAs capable of regulating other genes’ expression. Much progress has been made in computational target prediction of miRNAs in recent years. More than 10 miRNA target prediction programs have been established, yet, the prediction of animal miRNA targets remains a challenging task. We have developed miRecords, an integrated resource for animal miRNA–target interactions. The Validated Targets component of this resource hosts a large, high-quality manually curated database of experimentally validated miRNA–target interactions with systematic documentation of experimental support for each interaction. The current release of this database includes 1135 records of validated miRNA–target interactions between 301 miRNAs and 902 target genes in seven animal species. The Predicted Targets component of miRecords stores predicted miRNA targets produced by 11 established miRNA target prediction programs. miRecords is expected to serve as a useful resource not only for experimental miRNA researchers, but also for informatics scientists developing the next-generation miRNA target prediction programs. The miRecords is available at http://miRecords.umn.edu/miRecords.
Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD—http://www.hprd.org/), initially described in 2003, is a database of curated proteomic information pertaining to human proteins. We have recently added a number of new features in HPRD. These include PhosphoMotif Finder, which allows users to find the presence of over 320 experimentally verified phosphorylation motifs in proteins of interest. Another new feature is a protein distributed annotation system—Human Proteinpedia (http://www.humanproteinpedia.org/)—through which laboratories can submit their data, which is mapped onto protein entries in HPRD. Over 75 laboratories involved in proteomics research have already participated in this effort by submitting data for over 15 000 human proteins. The submitted data includes mass spectrometry and protein microarray-derived data, among other data types. Finally, HPRD is also linked to a compendium of human signaling pathways developed by our group, NetPath (http://www.netpath.org/), which currently contains annotations for several cancer and immune signaling pathways. Since the last update, more than 5500 new protein sequences have been added, making HPRD a comprehensive resource for studying the human proteome.
The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a curated database that promotes understanding about the effects of environmental chemicals on human health. Biocurators at CTD manually curate chemical–gene interactions, chemical–disease relationships and gene–disease relationships from the literature. This strategy allows data to be integrated to construct chemical–gene–disease networks. CTD is unique in numerous respects: curation focuses on environmental chemicals; interactions are manually curated; interactions are constructed using controlled vocabularies and hierarchies; additional gene attributes (such as Gene Ontology, taxonomy and KEGG pathways) are integrated; data can be viewed from the perspective of a chemical, gene or disease; results and batch queries can be downloaded and saved; and most importantly, CTD acts as both a knowledgebase (by reporting data) and a discovery tool (by generating novel inferences). Over 116 000 interactions between 3900 chemicals and 13 300 genes have been curated from 270 species, and 5900 gene–disease and 2500 chemical–disease direct relationships have been captured. By integrating these data, 350 000 gene–disease relationships and 77 000 chemical–disease relationships can be inferred. This wealth of chemical–gene–disease information yields testable hypotheses for understanding the effects of environmental chemicals on human health. CTD is freely available at http://ctd.mdibl.org.
GiardiaDB (http://GiardiaDB.org) and TrichDB (http://TrichDB.org) house the genome databases for Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis, respectively, and represent the latest additions to the EuPathDB (http://EuPathDB.org) family of functional genomic databases. GiardiaDB and TrichDB employ the same framework as other EuPathDB sites (CryptoDB, PlasmoDB and ToxoDB), supporting fully integrated and searchable databases. Genomic-scale data available via these resources may be queried based on BLAST searches, annotation keywords and gene ID searches, GO terms, sequence motifs and other protein characteristics. Functional queries may also be formulated, based on transcript and protein expression data from a variety of platforms. Phylogenetic relationships may also be interrogated. The ability to combine the results from independent queries, and to store queries and query results for future use facilitates complex, genome-wide mining of functional genomic data.
A dramatic exception to the general pattern of single-copy genes in bacterial and archaeal genomes is the presence of 1–15 copies of each ribosomal RNA encoding gene. The original version of the Ribosomal RNA Database (rrnDB) cataloged estimates of the number of 16S rRNA-encoding genes; the database now includes the number of genes encoding each of the rRNAs (5S, 16S and 23S), an internally transcribed spacer region, and the number of tRNA genes. The rrnDB has been used largely by microbiologists to predict the relative rate at which microbial populations respond to favorable growth conditions, and to interpret 16S rRNA-based surveys of microbial communities. To expand the functionality of the rrnDB (http://ribosome.mmg.msu.edu/rrndb/index.php), the search engine has been redesigned to allow database searches based on 16S rRNA gene copy number, specific organisms or taxonomic subsets of organisms. The revamped database also computes average gene copy numbers for any collection of entries selected. Curation tools now permit rapid updates, resulting in an expansion of the database to include data for 785 bacterial and 69 archaeal strains. The rrnDB continues to serve as the authoritative, curated source that documents the phylogenetic distribution of rRNA and tRNA genes in microbial genomes.
GenBank® is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for more than 300 000 organisms named at the genus level or lower, obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs, and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank® staff upon receipt. Daily data exchange with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Nucleotide Sequence Database in Europe and the DNA Data Bank of Japan ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez retrieval system, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. To access GenBank and its related retrieval and analysis services, begin at the NCBI Homepage: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
SUPERFAMILY provides structural, functional and evolutionary information for proteins from all completely sequenced genomes, and large sequence collections such as UniProt. Protein domain assignments for over 900 genomes are included in the database, which can be accessed at http://supfam.org/. Hidden Markov models based on Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) domain definitions at the superfamily level are used to provide structural annotation. We recently produced a new model library based on SCOP 1.73. Family level assignments are also available. From the web site users can submit sequences for SCOP domain classification; search for keywords such as superfamilies, families, organism names, models and sequence identifiers; find over- and underrepresented families or superfamilies within a genome relative to other genomes or groups of genomes; compare domain architectures across selections of genomes and finally build multiple sequence alignments between Protein Data Bank (PDB), genomic and custom sequences. Recent extensions to the database include InterPro abstracts and Gene Ontology terms for superfamiles, taxonomic visualization of the distribution of families across the tree of life, searches for functionally similar domain architectures and phylogenetic trees. The database, models and associated scripts are available for download from the ftp site.
Metabolic networks are a subject that has received much attention, but existing web resources do not include extensive phylogenetic information. Phylogenomic approaches (phylogenetics on a genomic scale) have been shown to be effective in the study of evolution and processes like horizontal gene transfer (HGT). To address the lack of phylogenomic information relating to eukaryotic metabolism, metaTIGER (www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/metatiger) has been created, using genomic information from 121 eukaryotes and 404 prokaryotes and sensitive sequence search techniques to predict the presence of metabolic enzymes. These enzyme sequences were used to create a comprehensive database of 2257 maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees, some containing over 500 organisms. The trees can be viewed using iTOL, an advanced interactive tree viewer, enabling straightforward interpretation of large trees. Complex high-throughput tree analysis is also available through user-defined queries, allowing the rapid identification of trees of interest, e.g. containing putative HGT events. metaTIGER also provides novel and easy-to-use facilities for viewing and comparing the metabolic networks in different organisms via highlighted pathway images and tables. metaTIGER is demonstrated through evolutionary analysis of Plasmodium, including identification of genes horizontally transferred from chlamydia.
Pseudofam (http://pseudofam.pseudogene.org) is a database of pseudogene families based on the protein families from the Pfam database. It provides resources for analyzing the family structure of pseudogenes including query tools, statistical summaries and sequence alignments. The current version of Pseudofam contains more than 125 000 pseudogenes identified from 10 eukaryotic genomes and aligned within nearly 3000 families (approximately one-third of the total families in PfamA). Pseudofam uses a large-scale parallelized homology search algorithm (implemented as an extension of the PseudoPipe pipeline) to identify pseudogenes. Each identified pseudogene is assigned to its parent protein family and subsequently aligned to each other by transferring the parent domain alignments from the Pfam family. Pseudogenes are also given additional annotation based on an ontology, reflecting their mode of creation and subsequent history. In particular, our annotation highlights the association of pseudogene families with genomic features, such as segmental duplications. In addition, pseudogene families are associated with key statistics, which identify outlier families with an unusual degree of pseudogenization. The statistics also show how the number of genes and pseudogenes in families correlates across different species. Overall, they highlight the fact that housekeeping families tend to be enriched with a large number of pseudogenes.
We present a new database and an on-line search engine, which store and query the protein binding pockets that interact with single-stranded RNA nucleotide bases. The database consists of a classification of binding sites derived from protein–RNA complexes. Each binding site is assigned to a cluster of similar binding sites in other protein–RNA complexes. Cluster members share similar spatial arrangements of physico–chemical properties, thus can reveal novel similarity between proteins and RNAs with different sequences and folds. The clusters provide 3D consensus binding patterns important for protein–nucleotide recognition. The database search engine allows two types of useful queries: first, given a PDB code of a protein–RNA complex, RsiteDB can detail and classify the properties of the protein binding pockets accommodating extruded RNA nucleotides not involved in local RNA base pairing. Second, given an unbound protein structure, RsiteDB can perform an on-line structural search against the constructed database of 3D consensus binding patterns. Regions similar to known patterns are predicted to serve as binding sites. Alignment of the query to these patterns with their corresponding RNA nucleotides allows making unique predictions of the protein–RNA interactions at the atomic level of detail. This database is accessable at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/RsiteDB.
The PIPs database (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-pips) is a resource for studying protein–protein interactions in human. It contains predictions of >37 000 high probability interactions of which >34 000 are not reported in the interaction databases HPRD, BIND, DIP or OPHID. The interactions in PIPs were calculated by a Bayesian method that combines information from expression, orthology, domain co-occurrence, post-translational modifications and sub-cellular location. The predictions also take account of the topology of the predicted interaction network. The web interface to PIPs ranks predictions according to their likelihood of interaction broken down by the contribution from each information source and with easy access to the evidence that supports each prediction. Where data exists in OPHID, HPRD, DIP or BIND for a protein pair this is also reported in the output tables returned by a search. A network browser is included to allow convenient browsing of the interaction network for any protein in the database. The PIPs database provides a new resource on protein–protein interactions in human that is straightforward to browse, or can be exploited completely, for interaction network modelling.
Messenger RNAs, in addition to coding for proteins, may contain regulatory elements that affect how the protein is translated. These include protein and microRNA-binding sites. Transterm (http://mRNA.otago.ac.nz/Transterm.html) is a database of regions and elements that affect translation with two major unique components. The first is integrated results of analysis of general features that affect translation (initiation, elongation, termination) for species or strains in Genbank, processed through a standard pipeline. The second is curated descriptions of experimentally determined regulatory elements that function as translational control elements in mRNAs. Transterm focuses on protein binding sites, particularly those in 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR). For this release the interface has been extensively updated based on user feedback. The data is now accessible by strain rather than species, for example there are 10 Escherichia coli strains (genomes) analysed separately. In addition to providing a repository of data, the database also provides tools for users to query their own mRNA sequences. Users can search sequences for Transterm or user defined regulatory elements, including protein or miRNA targets. Transterm also provides a central core of links to related resources for complementary analyses.
Rapid increases in DNA sequencing capabilities have led to a vast increase in the data generated from prokaryotic genomic studies, which has been a boon to scientists studying micro-organism evolution and to those who wish to understand the biological underpinnings of microbial systems. The NCBI Protein Clusters Database (ProtClustDB) has been created to efficiently maintain and keep the deluge of data up to date. ProtClustDB contains both curated and uncurated clusters of proteins grouped by sequence similarity. The May 2008 release contains a total of 285 386 clusters derived from over 1.7 million proteins encoded by 3806 nt sequences from the RefSeq collection of complete chromosomes and plasmids from four major groups: prokaryotes, bacteriophages and the mitochondrial and chloroplast organelles. There are 7180 clusters containing 376 513 proteins with curated gene and protein functional annotation. PubMed identifiers and external cross references are collected for all clusters and provide additional information resources. A suite of web tools is available to explore more detailed information, such as multiple alignments, phylogenetic trees and genomic neighborhoods. ProtClustDB provides an efficient method to aggregate gene and protein annotation for researchers and is available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=proteinclusters.
Molecular interaction data exists in a number of repositories, each with its own data format, molecule identifier and information coverage. Michigan molecular interactions (MiMI) assists scientists searching through this profusion of molecular interaction data. The original release of MiMI gathered data from well-known protein interaction databases, and deep merged this information while keeping track of provenance. Based on the feedback received from users, MiMI has been completely redesigned. This article describes the resulting MiMI Release 2 (MiMIr2). New functionality includes extension from proteins to genes and to pathways; identification of highlighted sentences in source publications; seamless two-way linkage with Cytoscape; query facilities based on MeSH/GO terms and other concepts; approximate graph matching to find relevant pathways; support for querying in bulk; and a user focus-group driven interface design. MiMI is part of the NIH's; National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI) and is publicly available at: http://mimi.ncibi.org.
Four hundred and eighty-one ultraconserved sequences (UCRs) longer than 200 bases were discovered in the genomes of human, mouse and rat. These are DNA sequences showing 100% identity among the three species. UCRs are frequently located at genomic regions involved in cancer, differentially expressed in human leukemias and carcinomas and in some instances regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). Here we present UCbase & miRfunc, the first database which provides ultraconserved sequences data and shows miRNA function. Also, it links UCRs and miRNAs with the related human disorders and genomic properties. The current release contains over 2000 sequences from three species (human, mouse and rat). As a web application, UCbase & miRfunc is platform independent and it is accessible at http://microrna.osu.edu/.UCbase4.
Zinc fingers are the most abundant DNA-binding motifs encoded by eukaryotic genomes and one of the best understood DNA-recognition domains. Each zinc finger typically binds a 3-nt target sequence, and it is possible to engineer zinc-finger arrays (ZFAs) that recognize extended DNA sequences by linking together individual zinc fingers. Engineered zinc-finger proteins have proven to be valuable tools for gene regulation and genome modification because they target specific sites in a genome. Here we describe ZiFDB (Zinc Finger Database; http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu/ZiFDB), a web-accessible resource that compiles information on individual zinc fingers and engineered ZFAs. To enhance its utility, ZiFDB is linked to the output from ZiFiT—a software package that assists biologists in finding sites within target genes for engineering zinc-finger proteins. For many molecular biologists, ZiFDB will be particularly valuable for determining if a given ZFA (or portion thereof) has previously been constructed and whether or not it has the requisite DNA-binding activity for their experiments. ZiFDB will also be a valuable resource for those scientists interested in better understanding how zinc-finger proteins recognize target DNA.
‘miR2Disease’, a manually curated database, aims at providing a comprehensive resource of microRNA deregulation in various human diseases. The current version of miR2Disease documents 1939 curated relationships between 299 human microRNAs and 94 human diseases by reviewing more than 600 published papers. Around one-seventh of the microRNA–disease relationships represent the pathogenic roles of deregulated microRNA in human disease. Each entry in the miR2Disease contains detailed information on a microRNA–disease relationship, including a microRNA ID, the disease name, a brief description of the microRNA–disease relationship, an expression pattern of the microRNA, the detection method for microRNA expression, experimentally verified target gene(s) of the microRNA and a literature reference. miR2Disease provides a user-friendly interface for a convenient retrieval of each entry by microRNA ID, disease name, or target gene. In addition, miR2Disease offers a submission page that allows researchers to submit established microRNA–disease relationships that are not documented. Once approved by the submission review committee, the submitted records will be included in the database. miR2Disease is freely available at http://www.miR2Disease.org.
DiProDB (http://diprodb.fli-leibniz.de) is a database of conformational and thermodynamic dinucleotide properties. It includes datasets both for DNA and RNA, as well as for single and double strands. The data have been shown to be important for understanding different aspects of nucleic acid structure and function, and they can also be used for encoding nucleic acid sequences. The database is intended to facilitate further applications of dinucleotide properties. A number of property datasets is highly correlated. Therefore, the database comes with a correlation analysis facility. Authors having determined new sets of dinucleotide property values are invited to submit these data to DiProDB.
Within our everyday life, we are confronted with a variety of toxic substances of natural or artificial origin. Toxins are already used, e.g. in medicine, but there is still an increasing number of toxic compounds, representing a tremendous potential to extract new substances. Since predictive toxicology gains in importance, the careful and extensive investigation of known toxins is the basis to assess the properties of unknown substances. In order to achieve this aim, we have collected toxic compounds from literature and web sources in the database SuperToxic. The current version of this database compiles about 60 000 compounds and their structures. These molecules are classified according to their toxicity, based on more than 2 million measurements. The SuperToxic database provides a variety of search options like name, CASRN, molecular weight and measured values of toxicity. With the aid of implemented similarity searches, information about possible biological interactions can be gained. Furthermore, connections to the Protein Data Bank, UniProt and the KEGG database are available, to allow the identification of targets and those pathways, the searched compounds are involved in. This database is available online at: http://bioinformatics.charite.de/supertoxic.
We constructed a new large-scale database of tRNA genes by analyzing 534 complete genomes of prokaryotes and 394 draft genomes in WGS (Whole Genome Shotgun) division in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank and approximately 6.2 million DNA fragment sequences obtained from metagenomic analyses. This exhaustive search for tRNA genes was performed by running three computer programs to enhance completeness and accuracy of the prediction. Discordances of assignment among three programs were found for ∼4% of the total of tRNA gene candidates obtained from these prokaryote genomes analyzed. The discordant cases were manually checked by experts in the tRNA experimental field. In total, 144 061 tRNA genes were registered in the database ‘tRNADB-CE’, and the number of the genes was more than four times of that of the genes previously reported by the database from analyses of complete genomes with tRNAscan-SE program. The tRNADB-CE allows for browsing sequence information, cloverleaf structures and results of similarity searches among all tRNA genes. For each of the complete genomes, the number of tRNA genes for individual anticodons and the codon usage frequency in all protein genes and the positioning of individual tRNA genes in each genome can be browsed. tRNADB-CE can be accessed freely at http://trna.nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp.
The current issue of Nucleic Acids Research includes descriptions of 179 databases, of which 95 are new. These databases (along with several molecular biology databases described in other journals) have been included in the Nucleic Acids Research online Molecular Biology Database Collection, bringing the total number of databases in the collection to 1170. In this introductory comment, we briefly describe some of these new databases and review the principles guiding the selection of databases for inclusion in the Nucleic Acids Research annual Database Issue and the Nucleic Acids Research online Molecular Biology Database Collection. The complete database list and summaries are available online at the Nucleic Acids Research web site (http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/).
The database of Alignable Tight Genomic Clusters (ATGCs) consists of closely related genomes of archaea and bacteria, and is a resource for research into prokaryotic microevolution. Construction of a data set with appropriate characteristics is a major hurdle for this type of studies. With the current rate of genome sequencing, it is difficult to follow the progress of the field and to determine which of the available genome sets meet the requirements of a given research project, in particular, with respect to the minimum and maximum levels of similarity between the included genomes. Additionally, extraction of specific content, such as genomic alignments or families of orthologs, from a selected set of genomes is a complicated and time-consuming process. The database addresses these problems by providing an intuitive and efficient web interface to browse precomputed ATGCs, select appropriate ones and access ATGC-derived data such as multiple alignments of orthologous proteins, matrices of pairwise intergenomic distances based on genome-wide analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates and others. The ATGC database will be regularly updated following new releases of the NCBI RefSeq. The database is hosted by the Genomics Division at Lawrence Berkeley National laboratory and is publicly available at http://atgc.lbl.gov
Sharing proteomic data with the biomedical community through a unified proteomic resource, especially in the context of individual proteins, is a challenging prospect. We have developed a community portal, designated as Human Proteinpedia (http://www.humanproteinpedia.org/), for sharing both unpublished and published human proteomic data through the use of a distributed annotation system designed specifically for this purpose. This system allows laboratories to contribute and maintain protein annotations, which are also mapped to the corresponding proteins through the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD; http://www.hprd.org/). Thus, it is possible to visualize data pertaining to experimentally validated posttranslational modifications (PTMs), protein isoforms, protein–protein interactions (PPIs), tissue expression, expression in cell lines, subcellular localization and enzyme substrates in the context of individual proteins. With enthusiastic participation of the proteomics community, the past 15 months have witnessed data contributions from more than 75 labs around the world including 2710 distinct experiments, >1.9 million peptides, >4.8 million MS/MS spectra, 150 368 protein expression annotations, 17 410 PTMs, 34 624 PPIs and 2906 subcellular localization annotations. Human Proteinpedia should serve as an integrated platform to store, integrate and disseminate such proteomic data and is inching towards evolving into a unified human proteomics resource.
ExplorEnz is the MySQL database that is used for the curation and dissemination of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) Enzyme Nomenclature. A simple web-based query interface is provided, along with an advanced search engine for more complex Boolean queries. The WWW front-end is accessible at http://www.enzyme-database.org, from where downloads of the database as SQL and XML are also available. An associated form-based curatorial application has been developed to facilitate the curation of enzyme data as well as the internal and public review processes that occur before an enzyme entry is made official. Suggestions for new enzyme entries, or modifications to existing ones, can be made using the forms provided at http://www.enzyme-database.org/forms.php.
SNPLogic (http://www.snplogic.org) brings together single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information from numerous sources to provide a comprehensive SNP selection, annotation and prioritization system for design and analysis of genotyping projects. SNPLogic integrates information about the genetic context of SNPs (gene, chromosomal region, functional location, haplotypes tags and overlap with transcription factor binding sites, splicing sites, miRNAs and evolutionarily conserved regions), genotypic data (allele frequencies per population and validation method), coverage of commercial arrays (ParAllele, Affymetrix and Illumina), functional predictions (modeled on structure and sequence) and connections or established associations (biological pathways, gene ontology terms and OMIM disease terms). The SNPLogic web interface facilitates construction and annotation of user-defined SNP lists that can be saved, shared and exported. Thus, SNPLogic can be used to identify and prioritize candidate SNPs, assess custom and commercial arrays panels and annotate new SNP data with publicly available information. We have found integration of SNP annotation in the context of pathway information and functional prediction scores to be a powerful approach to the analysis and interpretation of SNP-disease association data.
BodyParts3D is a dictionary-type database for anatomy in which anatomical concepts are represented by 3D structure data that specify corresponding segments of a 3D whole-body model for an adult human male. It encompasses morphological and geometrical knowledge in anatomy and complements ontological representation. Moreover, BodyParts3D introduces a universal coordinate system in human anatomy, which may facilitate management of samples and data in biomedical research and clinical practice. As of today, 382 anatomical concepts, sufficient for mapping materials in most molecular medicine experiments, have been specified. Expansion of the dictionary by adding further segments and details to the whole-body model will continue in collaboration with clinical researchers until sufficient resolution and accuracy for most clinical application are achieved. BodyParts3D is accessible at: http://lifesciencedb.jp/ag/bp3d/.
We have constructed a database, AS-ALPS (alternative splicing-induced alteration of protein structure), which provides information that would be useful for analyzing the effects of alternative splicing (AS) on protein structure, interactions with other bio-molecules and protein interaction networks in human and mouse. Several AS events have been revealed to contribute to the diversification of protein structure, which results in diversification of interaction partners or affinities, which in turn contributes to regulation of bio-molecular networks. Most AS variants, however, are only known at the sequence level. It is important to determine the effects of AS on protein structure and interaction, and to provide candidates for experimental targets that are relevant to network regulation by AS. For this purpose, the three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins are valuable sources of information; however, these have not been fully exploited in any other AS-related databases. AS-ALPS is the only AS-related database that describes the spatial relationships between protein regions altered by AS (‘AS regions’) and both the proteins’ hydrophobic cores and sites of inter-molecular interactions. This information makes it possible to infer whether protein structural stability and/or protein interaction are affected by each AS event. AS-ALPS can be freely accessed at http://as-alps.nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp and http://genomenetwork.nig.ac.jp/as-alps/.
The Mouse Genome Database (MGD, http://www.informatics.jax.org/), integrates genetic, genomic and phenotypic information about the laboratory mouse, a primary animal model for studying human biology and disease. Information in MGD is obtained from diverse sources, including the scientific literature and external databases, such as EntrezGene, UniProt and GenBank. In addition to its extensive collection of phenotypic allele information for mouse genes that is curated from the published biomedical literature and researcher submission, MGI includes a comprehensive representation of mouse genes including sequence, functional (GO) and comparative information. MGD provides a data mining platform that enables the development of translational research hypotheses based on comparative genotype, phenotype and functional analyses. MGI can be accessed by a variety of methods including web-based search forms, a genome sequence browser and downloadable database reports. Programmatic access is available using web services. Recent improvements in MGD described here include the unified mouse gene catalog for NCBI Build 37 of the reference genome assembly, and improved representation of mouse mutants and phenotypes.
The datasets on gene expression are the valuable source of information about the functional state of an organism. Recently, we have acquired the large dataset on expression of segmentation genes in the Drosophila blastoderm. To provide efficient access to the data, we have developed the FlyEx database (http://urchin.spbcas.ru/flyex). FlyEx contains 4716 images of 14 segmentation gene expression patterns obtained from 1579 embryos and 9 500 000 quantitative data records. Reference data are available for all segmentation genes in cycles 11–13 and all temporal classes of cycle 14A. FlyEx supports operations on images of gene expression patterns. The database can be used to examine the quality of data, analyze the dynamics of formation of segmentation gene expression domains, as well as to estimate the variability of gene expression patterns. Currently, a user is able to monitor and analyze the dynamics of formation of segmentation gene expression domains over the whole period of segment determination, that amounts to 1.5 h of development. FlyEx supports the data downloads and construction of personal reference datasets, that makes it possible to more effectively use and analyze data.
The effective control of tuberculosis (TB) has been thwarted by the need for prolonged, complex and potentially toxic drug regimens, by reliance on an inefficient vaccine and by the absence of biomarkers of clinical status. The promise of the genomics era for TB control is substantial, but has been hindered by the lack of a central repository that collects and integrates genomic and experimental data about this organism in a way that can be readily accessed and analyzed. The Tuberculosis Database (TBDB) is an integrated database providing access to TB genomic data and resources, relevant to the discovery and development of TB drugs, vaccines and biomarkers. The current release of TBDB houses genome sequence data and annotations for 28 different Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and related bacteria. TBDB stores pre- and post-publication gene-expression data from M. tuberculosis and its close relatives. TBDB currently hosts data for nearly 1500 public tuberculosis microarrays and 260 arrays for Streptomyces. In addition, TBDB provides access to a suite of comparative genomics and microarray analysis software. By bringing together M. tuberculosis genome annotation and gene-expression data with a suite of analysis tools, TBDB (http://www.tbdb.org/) provides a unique discovery platform for TB research.
The Ensembl project (http://www.ensembl.org) is a comprehensive genome information system featuring an integrated set of genome annotation, databases, and other information for chordate, selected model organism and disease vector genomes. As of release 51 (November 2008), Ensembl fully supports 45 species, and three additional species have preliminary support. New species in the past year include orangutan and six additional low coverage mammalian genomes. Major additions and improvements to Ensembl since our previous report include a major redesign of our website; generation of multiple genome alignments and ancestral sequences using the new Enredo-Pecan-Ortheus pipeline and development of our software infrastructure, particularly to support the Ensembl Genomes project (http://www.ensemblgenomes.org/).
The PAZAR database unites independently created and maintained data collections of transcription factor and regulatory sequence annotation. The flexible PAZAR schema permits the representation of diverse information derived from experiments ranging from biochemical protein–DNA binding to cellular reporter gene assays. Data collections can be made available to the public, or restricted to specific system users. The data ‘boutiques’ within the shopping-mall-inspired system facilitate the analysis of genomics data and the creation of predictive models of gene regulation. Since its initial release, PAZAR has grown in terms of data, features and through the addition of an associated package of software tools called the ORCA toolkit (ORCAtk). ORCAtk allows users to rapidly develop analyses based on the information stored in the PAZAR system. PAZAR is available at http://www.pazar.info. ORCAtk can be accessed through convenient buttons located in the PAZAR pages or via our website at http://www.cisreg.ca/ORCAtk.
The EcID database (Escherichia coli Interaction Database) provides a framework for the integration of information on functional interactions extracted from the following sources: EcoCyc (metabolic pathways, protein complexes and regulatory information), KEGG (metabolic pathways), MINT and IntAct (protein interactions). It also includes information on protein complexes from the two E. coli high-throughput pull-down experiments and potential interactions extracted from the literature using the web services associated to the iHOP text-mining system. Additionally, EcID incorporates results of various prediction methods, including two protein interaction prediction methods based on genomic information (Phylogenetic Profiles and Gene Neighbourhoods) and three methods based on the analysis of co-evolution (Mirror Tree, In Silico 2 Hybrid and Context Mirror). EcID associates to each prediction a specifically developed confidence score. The two main features that make EcID different from other systems are the combination of co-evolution-based predictions with the experimental data, and the introduction of E. coli-specific information, such as gene regulation information from EcoCyc. The possibilities offered by the combination of the EcID database information are illustrated with a prediction of potential functions for a group of poorly characterized genes related to yeaG. EcID is available online at http://ecid.bioinfo.cnio.es.
An experimental data handling system has been created as an update to the previous Nucleolar Proteome Database (NOPdb3.0: http://www.lamondlab.com/NOPdb3.0/). This updated system is able to manage large data sets identified by multiple mass spectrometry and has been used to analyse highly purified preparations of human nucleoli from different cell lines. The newly created application includes a dynamic relational database, which is kept up to date by laboratory staff. The data are further annotated with information from specific external sources on the web, including the IPI and Gene Ontology databases. In addition, an Application Programming Interface provides external users with a portal to link into the nucleolar proteome database and hence, gain access to continually updated results. From the initial ∼700 human proteins identified in the previous iteration of the NOPdb, we have now identified over 50 000 peptides contained in over 4500 human proteins from purified nucleoli, providing enhanced coverage of the nucleolar proteome.
NCBI's Conserved Domain Database (CDD) is a collection of multiple sequence alignments and derived database search models, which represent protein domains conserved in molecular evolution. The collection can be accessed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml, and is also part of NCBI's Entrez query and retrieval system, cross-linked to numerous other resources. CDD provides annotation of domain footprints and conserved functional sites on protein sequences. Precalculated domain annotation can be retrieved for protein sequences tracked in NCBI's Entrez system, and CDD's collection of models can be queried with novel protein sequences via the CD-Search service at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi. Starting with the latest version of CDD, v2.14, information from redundant and homologous domain models is summarized at a superfamily level, and domain annotation on proteins is flagged as either ‘specific’ (identifying molecular function with high confidence) or as ‘non-specific’ (identifying superfamily membership only).
Members of the protein kinase family are amongst the most commonly mutated genes in human cancer, and both mutated and activated protein kinases have proved to be tractable targets for the development of new anticancer therapies The MoKCa database (Mutations of Kinases in Cancer, http://strubiol.icr.ac.uk/extra/mokca) has been developed to structurally and functionally annotate, and where possible predict, the phenotypic consequences of mutations in protein kinases implicated in cancer. Somatic mutation data from tumours and tumour cell lines have been mapped onto the crystal structures of the affected protein domains. Positions of the mutated amino-acids are highlighted on a sequence-based domain pictogram, as well as a 3D-image of the protein structure, and in a molecular graphics package, integrated for interactive viewing. The data associated with each mutation is presented in the Web interface, along with expert annotation of the detailed molecular functional implications of the mutation. Proteins are linked to functional annotation resources and are annotated with structural and functional features such as domains and phosphorylation sites. MoKCa aims to provide assessments available from multiple sources and algorithms for each potential cancer-associated mutation, and present these together in a consistent and coherent fashion to facilitate authoritative annotation by cancer biologists and structural biologists, directly involved in the generation and analysis of new mutational data.
The EST division of GenBank, dbEST, is widely used in many applications such as gene discovery and verification of exon–intron structure. However, the use of EST sequences in the dbEST libraries is often hampered by inconsistent terminology used to describe the library sources and by the presence of contaminated sequences. Here, we describe CleanEST, a novel database server that classified dbEST libraries and removes contaminants. We classified all dbEST libraries according to species and sequencing center. In addition, we further classified human EST libraries by anatomical and pathological systems according to eVOC ontologies. For each dbEST library, we provide two different cleansed sequences: ‘pre-cleansed’ and ‘user-cleansed’. To generate pre-cleansed sequences, we cleansed sequences in dbEST by alignment of EST sequences against well-known contamination sources: UniVec, Escherichia coli, mitochondria and chloroplast (for plant). To provide user-cleansed sequences, we built an automatic user-cleansing pipeline, in which sequences of a user-selected library are cleansed on-the-fly according to user-selected options. The server is available at http://cleanest.kobic.re.kr/ and the database is updated monthly.
Minimotif Miner (MnM) consists of a minimotif database and a web-based application that enables prediction of motif-based functions in user-supplied protein queries. We have revised MnM by expanding the database more than 10-fold to approximately 5000 motifs and standardized the motif function definitions. The web-application user interface has been redeveloped with new features including improved navigation, screencast-driven help, support for alias names and expanded SNP analysis. A sample analysis of prion shows how MnM 2 can be used. Weblink: http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu, weblink for version 1 is http://sms.engr.uconn.edu.
Functional partnerships between proteins are at the core of complex cellular phenotypes, and the networks formed by interacting proteins provide researchers with crucial scaffolds for modeling, data reduction and annotation. STRING is a database and web resource dedicated to protein–protein interactions, including both physical and functional interactions. It weights and integrates information from numerous sources, including experimental repositories, computational prediction methods and public text collections, thus acting as a meta-database that maps all interaction evidence onto a common set of genomes and proteins. The most important new developments in STRING 8 over previous releases include a URL-based programming interface, which can be used to query STRING from other resources, improved interaction prediction via genomic neighborhood in prokaryotes, and the inclusion of protein structures. Version 8.0 of STRING covers about 2.5 million proteins from 630 organisms, providing the most comprehensive view on protein–protein interactions currently available. STRING can be reached at http://string-db.org/.
Simple modular architecture research tool (SMART) is an online tool (http://smart.embl.de/) for the identification and annotation of protein domains. It provides a user-friendly platform for the exploration and comparative study of domain architectures in both proteins and genes. The current release of SMART contains manually curated models for 784 protein domains. Recent developments were focused on further data integration and improving user friendliness. The underlying protein database based on completely sequenced genomes was greatly expanded and now includes 630 species, compared to 191 in the previous release. As an initial step towards integrating information on biological pathways into SMART, our domain annotations were extended with data on metabolic pathways and links to several pathways resources. The interaction network view was completely redesigned and is now available for more than 2 million proteins. In addition to the standard web access to the database, users can now query SMART using distributed annotation system (DAS) or through a simple object access protocol (SOAP) based web service.
We have developed the database TMFunction, which is a collection of more than 2900 experimentally observed functional residues in membrane proteins. Each entry includes the numerical values for the parameters IC50 (measure of the effectiveness of a compound in inhibiting biological function), Vmax (maximal velocity of transport), relative activity of mutants with respect to wild-type protein, binding affinity, dissociation constant, etc., which are important for understanding the sequence–structure–function relationship of membrane proteins. In addition, we have provided information about name and source of the protein, Uniprot and Protein Data Bank codes, mutational and literature information. Furthermore, TMFunction is linked to related databases and other resources. We have set up a web interface with different search and display options so that users have the ability to get the data in several ways. TMFunction is freely available at http://tmbeta-genome.cbrc.jp/TMFunction/.
The mission of UniProt is to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequence and functional information that is essential for modern biological research. UniProt is produced by the UniProt Consortium which consists of groups from the European Bioinformatics Institute, the Protein Information Resource and the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The core activities include manual curation of protein sequences assisted by computational analysis, sequence archiving, a user-friendly UniProt website and the provision of additional value-added information through cross-references to other databases. UniProt is comprised of four major components, each optimized for different uses: the UniProt Archive, the UniProt Knowledgebase, the UniProt Reference Clusters and the UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental Sequence Database. One of the key achievements of the UniProt consortium in 2008 is the completion of the first draft of the complete human proteome in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. This manually annotated representation of all currently known human protein-coding genes was made available in UniProt release 14.0 with 20 325 entries. UniProt is updated and distributed every three weeks and can be accessed online for searches or downloaded at www.uniprot.org.
NCBI's Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/) is a curated non-redundant collection of sequences representing genomes, transcripts and proteins. RefSeq records integrate information from multiple sources and represent a current description of the sequence, the gene and sequence features. The database includes over 5300 organisms spanning prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses, with records for more than 5.5 × 106 proteins (RefSeq release 30). Feature annotation is applied by a combination of curation, collaboration, propagation from other sources and computation. We report here on the recent growth of the database, recent changes to feature annotations and record types for eukaryotic (primarily vertebrate) species and policies regarding species inclusion and genome annotation. In addition, we introduce RefSeqGene, a new initiative to support reporting variation data on a stable genomic coordinate system.
Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) play a vital role in initiating infection in a number of pathogens. Identifying which interactions allow a pathogen to infect its host can help us to understand methods of pathogenesis and provide potential targets for therapeutics. Public resources for studying host–pathogen systems, in particular PPIs, are scarce. To facilitate the study of host–pathogen PPIs, we have collected and integrated host–pathogen PPI (HP–PPI) data from a number of public resources to create the Pathogen Interaction Gateway (PIG). PIG provides a text based search and a BLAST interface for searching the HP–PPI data. Each entry in PIG includes information such as the functional annotations and the domains present in the interacting proteins. PIG provides links to external databases to allow for easy navigation among the various websites. Additionally, PIG includes a tool for visualizing a single HP–PPI network or two HP–PPI networks. PIG can be accessed at http://pig.vbi.vt.edu.
Creation of a vast variety of proteins is accomplished by genetic variation and a variety of alternative splicing transcripts. Currently, however, the abundant available data on genetic variation and the transcriptome are stored independently and in a dispersed fashion. In order to provide a research resource regarding the effects of human genetic polymorphism on various transcripts, we developed VarySysDB, a genetic polymorphism database based on 187 156 extensively annotated matured mRNA transcripts from 36 073 loci provided by H-InvDB. VarySysDB offers information encompassing published human genetic polymorphisms for each of these transcripts separately. This allows comparisons of effects derived from a polymorphism on different transcripts. The published information we analyzed includes single nucleotide polymorphisms and deletion–insertion polymorphisms from dbSNP, copy number variations from Database of Genomic Variants, short tandem repeats and single amino acid repeats from H-InvDB and linkage disequilibrium regions from D-HaploDB. The information can be searched and retrieved by features, functions and effects of polymorphisms, as well as by keywords. VarySysDB combines two kinds of viewers, GBrowse and Sequence View, to facilitate understanding of the positional relationship among polymorphisms, genome, transcripts, loci and functional domains. We expect that VarySysDB will yield useful information on polymorphisms affecting gene expression and phenotypes. VarySysDB is available at http://h-invitational.jp/varygene/.
McKusick's Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM®; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim), a knowledgebase of human genes and phenotypes, was originally published as a book, Mendelian Inheritance in Man, in 1966. The content of OMIM is derived exclusively from the published biomedical literature and is updated daily. It currently contains 18 961 full-text entries describing phenotypes and genes. To date, 2239 genes have mutations causing disease, and 3770 diseases have a molecular basis. Approximately 70 new entries are added and 700 entries are updated per month. OMIM® is expanding content and organization in response to shifting biological paradigms and advancing biotechnology.
The potency of the immune response has still to be harnessed effectively to combat human cancers. However, the discovery of T-cell targets in melanomas and other tumors has raised the possibility that cancer vaccines can be used to induce a therapeutically effective immune response against cancer. The targets, cancer-testis (CT) antigens, are immunogenic proteins preferentially expressed in normal gametogenic tissues and different histological types of tumors. Therapeutic cancer vaccines directed against CT antigens are currently in late-stage clinical trials testing whether they can delay or prevent recurrence of lung cancer and melanoma following surgical removal of primary tumors. CT antigens constitute a large, but ill-defined, family of proteins that exhibit a remarkably restricted expression. Currently, there is a considerable amount of information about these proteins, but the data are scattered through the literature and in several bioinformatic databases. The database presented here, CTdatabase (http://www.cta.lncc.br), unifies this knowledge to facilitate both the mining of the existing deluge of data, and the identification of proteins alleged to be CT antigens, but that do not have their characteristic restricted expression pattern. CTdatabase is more than a repository of CT antigen data, since all the available information was carefully curated and annotated with most data being specifically processed for CT antigens and stored locally. Starting from a compilation of known CT antigens, CTdatabase provides basic information including gene names and aliases, RefSeq accession numbers, genomic location, known splicing variants, gene duplications and additional family members. Gene expression at the mRNA level in normal and tumor tissues has been collated from publicly available data obtained by several different technologies. Manually curated data related to mRNA and protein expression, and antigen-specific immune responses in cancer patients are also available, together with links to PubMed for relevant CT antigen articles.
TarBase5.0 is a database which houses a manually curated collection of experimentally supported microRNA (miRNA) targets in several animal species of central scientific interest, plants and viruses. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that exhibit an inhibitory effect on gene expression, interfering with the stability and translational efficiency of the targeted mature messenger RNAs. Even though several computational programs exist to predict miRNA targets, there is a need for a comprehensive collection and description of miRNA targets with experimental support. Here we introduce a substantially extended version of this resource. The current version includes more than 1300 experimentally supported targets. Each target site is described by the miRNA that binds it, the gene in which it occurs, the nature of the experiments that were conducted to test it, the sufficiency of the site to induce translational repression and/or cleavage, and the paper from which all these data were extracted. Additionally, the database is functionally linked to several other relevant and useful databases such as Ensembl, Hugo, UCSC and SwissProt. The TarBase5.0 database can be queried or downloaded from http://microrna.gr/tarbase.
The increasing number of solved macromolecules provides a solid number of 3D interfaces, if all types of molecular contacts are being considered. JAIL annotates three different kinds of macromolecular interfaces, those between interacting protein domains, interfaces of different protein chains and interfaces between proteins and nucleic acids. This results in a total number of about 184 000 database entries. All the interfaces can easily be identified by a detailed search form or by a hierarchical tree that describes the protein domain architectures classified by the SCOP database. Visual inspection of the interfaces is possible via an interactive protein viewer. Furthermore, large scale analyses are supported by an implemented sequential and by a structural clustering. Similar interfaces as well as non-redundant interfaces can be easily picked out. Additionally, the sequential conservation of binding sites was also included in the database and is retrievable via Jmol. A comprehensive download section allows the composition of representative data sets with user defined parameters. The huge data set in combination with various search options allow a comprehensive view on all interfaces between macromolecules included in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The download of the data sets supports numerous further investigations in macromolecular recognition. JAIL is publicly available at http://bioinformatics.charite.de/jail.
Completion of human genome sequencing has greatly accelerated functional genomic research. Full-length cDNA clones are essential experimental tools for functional analysis of human genes. In one of the projects of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in Japan, the full-length human cDNA sequencing project (FLJ project), nucleotide sequences of approximately 30 000 human cDNA clones have been analyzed. The Gateway system is a versatile framework to construct a variety of expression clones for various experiments. We have constructed 33 275 human Gateway entry clones from full-length cDNAs, representing to our knowledge the largest collection in the world. Utilizing these clones with a highly efficient cell-free protein synthesis system based on wheat germ extract, we have systematically and comprehensively produced and analyzed human proteins in vitro. Sequence information for both amino acids and nucleotides of open reading frames of cDNAs cloned into Gateway entry clones and in vitro expression data using those clones can be retrieved from the Human Gene and Protein Database (HGPD, http://www.HGPD.jp). HGPD is a unique database that stores the information of a set of human Gateway entry clones and protein expression data and helps the user to search the Gateway entry clones.
Bionemo (http://bionemo.bioinfo.cnio.es) stores manually curated information about proteins and genes directly implicated in the Biodegradation metabolism. When possible, the database includes information on sequence, domains and structures for proteins; and sequence, regulatory elements and transcription units for genes. Thus, Bionemo is a unique resource that complements other biodegradation databases such as the University of Minessota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database, or Metarouter, which focus more on the biochemical aspects of biodegradation than in the nature of the biomolecules carrying out the reactions. Bionemo has been built by manually associating sequences database entries to biodegradation reactions, using the information extracted from published articles. Information on transcription units and their regulation was also extracted from the literature for biodegradation genes, and linked to the underlying biochemical network. In its current version, Bionemo contains sequence information for 324 reactions and transcription regulation information for more than 100 promoters and 100 transcription factors. The information in the Bionemo database is available via a web server and the full database is also downloadable as a PostgresSQL dump. To facilitate the programmatic use of the information contained in the database, an object-oriented Perl API is also provided.
Finding related conformations in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is essential in many areas of bioscience. To assist this task, we designed a search engine that uses a compact database to quickly identify protein segments obeying a set of primary, secondary and tertiary structure constraints. The database contains information such as amino acid sequence, secondary structure, disulfide bonds, hydrogen bonds and atoms in contact as calculated from all protein structures in the PDB. The search engine parses the database and returns hits that match the queried parameters. The conformation search engine, which is notable for its high speed and interactive feedback, is expected to assist scientists in discovering conformation homologs and predicting protein structure. The engine is publicly available at http://ari.stanford.edu/psf and it will also be used in-house in an automatic mode aimed at discovering new protein motifs.
dictyBase (http://dictybase.org) is the model organism database for Dictyostelium discoideum. It houses the complete genome sequence, ESTs and the entire body of literature relevant to Dictyostelium. This information is curated to provide accurate gene models and functional annotations, with the goal of fully annotating the genome. This dictyBase update describes the annotations and features implemented since 2006, including improved strain and phenotype representation, integration of predicted transcriptional regulatory elements, protein domain information, biochemical pathways, improved searching and a wiki tool that allows members of the research community to provide annotations.
Infectious diseases caused by viral agents kill millions of people every year. The improvement of prevention and treatment of viral infections and their associated diseases remains one of the main public health challenges. Towards this goal, deciphering virus–host molecular interactions opens new perspectives to understand the biology of infection and for the design of new antiviral strategies. Indeed, modelling of an infection network between viral and cellular proteins will provide a conceptual and analytic framework to efficiently formulate new biological hypothesis at the proteome scale and to rationalize drug discovery. Therefore, we present the first release of VirHostNet (Virus–Host Network), a public knowledge base specialized in the management and analysis of integrated virus–virus, virus–host and host–host interaction networks coupled to their functional annotations. VirHostNet integrates an extensive and original literature-curated dataset of virus–virus and virus–host interactions (2671 non-redundant interactions) representing more than 180 distinct viral species and one of the largest human interactome (10 672 proteins and 68 252 non-redundant interactions) reconstructed from publicly available data. The VirHostNet Web interface provides appropriate tools that allow efficient query and visualization of this infected cellular network. Public access to the VirHostNet knowledge-based system is available at http://pbildb1.univ-lyon1.fr/virhostnet.
Overlapping genes are defined as a pair of genes whose transcripts are overlapped. Recently, many cases of overlapped genes have been investigated in various eukaryotic organisms; however, their origin and transcriptional control mechanism has not yet been clearly determined. In this study, we implemented evolutionary visualizer for overlapping genes (EVOG), a Web-based DB with a novel visualization interface, to investigate the evolutionary relationship between overlapping genes. Using this technique, we collected and analyzed all overlapping genes in human, chimpanzee, orangutan, marmoset, rhesus, cow, dog, mouse, rat, chicken, Xenopus, zebrafish and Drosophila. This integrated database provides a manually curated database that displays the evolutionary features of overlapping genes. The EVOG DB components included a number of overlapping genes (10‱074 in human, 10 ‱009 in chimpanzee, 67 ‱039 in orangutan, 51 001 in marmoset, 219 in rhesus, 3627 in cow, 209 in dog, 10 ‱700 in mouse, 7987 in rat, 1439 in chicken, 597 in Xenopus, 2457 in zebrafish and 4115 in Drosophila). The EVOG database is very effective and easy to use for the analysis of the evolutionary process of overlapping genes when comparing different species. Therefore, EVOG could potentially be used as the main tool to investigate the evolution of the human genome in relation to disease by comparing the expression profiles of overlapping genes. EVOG is available at http://neobio.cs.pusan.ac.kr/evog/.
We developed a pair of databases that support two important tasks: annotation of anonymous RNA transcripts and discovery of novel non-coding RNAs. The database combo is called the Functional RNA Database and consists of two databases: a rewrite of the original version of the Functional RNA Database (fRNAdb) and the latest version of the UCSC GenomeBrowser for Functional RNA. The former is a sequence database equipped with a powerful search function and hosts a large collection of known/predicted non-coding RNA sequences acquired from existing databases as well as novel/predicted sequences reported by researchers of the Functional RNA Project. The latter is a UCSC Genome Browser mirror with large additional custom tracks specifically associated with non-coding elements. It also includes several functional enhancements such as a presentation of a common secondary structure prediction at any given genomic window ⩽500 bp. Our GenomeBrowser supports user authentication and user-specific tracks. The current version of the fRNAdb is a complete rewrite of the former version, hosting a larger number of sequences and with a much friendlier interface. The current version of UCSC GenomeBrowser for Functional RNA features a larger number of tracks and richer features than the former version. The databases are available at http://www.ncrna.org/.
The database of 3D interacting domains (3did) is a collection of protein interactions for which high-resolution 3D structures are known. 3did exploits structural information to provide the crucial molecular details necessary for understanding how protein interactions occur. Besides interactions between globular domains, the new release of 3did also contains a hand-curated set of transient peptide-mediated interactions. The interactions are grouped in Interaction Types, based on the mode of binding, and the different binding interfaces used in each type are also identified and catalogued. A web-based tool to query 3did is available at http://3did.irbbarcelona.org.
Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) carry out a variety of biological functions and affect protein synthesis and protein activities in prokaryotes. Recently, numerous sRNAs and their targets were identified in Escherichia coli and in other bacteria. It is crucial to have a comprehensive resource concerning the annotation of small non-coding RNAs in microbial genomes. This work presents an integrated database, namely sRNAMap, to collect the sRNA genes, the transcriptional regulators of sRNAs and the sRNA target genes by integrating a variety of biological databases and by surveying literature. In this resource, we collected 397 sRNAs, 62 regulators/sRNAs and 60 sRNAs/targets in 70 microbial genomes. Additionally, more valuable information of the sRNAs, such as the secondary structure of sRNAs, the expressed conditions of sRNAs, the expression profiles of sRNAs, the transcriptional start sites of sRNAs and the cross-links to other biological databases, are provided for further investigation. Besides, various textual and graphical interfaces were designed and implemented to facilitate the data access in sRNAMap. sRNAMap is available at http://sRNAMap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.
C2H2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZNF) genes are one of the largest and most complex gene super-families in metazoan genomes, with hundreds of members in the human and mouse genome. The ongoing investigation of this huge gene family requires computational support to catalog genotype phenotype comparisons of C2H2-ZNF genes between related species and finally to extend the worldwide knowledge on the evolution of C2H2-ZNF genes in general. Here, we systematically collected all the C2H2-ZNF genes in the human and mouse genome and constructed a database named SysZNF to deposit available datasets related to these genes. In the database, each C2H2-ZNF gene entry consists of physical location, gene model (including different transcript forms), Affymetrix gene expression probes, protein domain structures, homologs (and synteny between human and mouse), PubMed references as well as links to relevant public databases. The clustered organization of the C2H2-ZNF genes is highlighted. The database can be searched using text strings or sequence information. The data are also available for batch download from the web site. Moreover, the graphical gene model/protein view system, sequence retrieval system and some other tools embedded in SysZNF facilitate the research on the C2H2 type ZNF genes under an integrative view. The database can be accessed from the URL http://epgd.biosino.org/SysZNF.
The specificity-determining residue database (SDR database) presents residue positions where mutations are predicted to have changed protein function in large protein families. Because the database pre-calculates predictions on existing protein sequence alignments, users can quickly find the predictions by selecting the appropriate protein family or searching by protein sequence. Predictions can be used to guide mutagenesis or to gain a better understanding of specificity changes in a protein family. The database is available on the web at http://paradox.harvard.edu/sdr.
The Pathway Interaction Database (PID, http://pid.nci.nih.gov) is a freely available collection of curated and peer-reviewed pathways composed of human molecular signaling and regulatory events and key cellular processes. Created in a collaboration between the US National Cancer Institute and Nature Publishing Group, the database serves as a research tool for the cancer research community and others interested in cellular pathways, such as neuroscientists, developmental biologists and immunologists. PID offers a range of search features to facilitate pathway exploration. Users can browse the predefined set of pathways or create interaction network maps centered on a single molecule or cellular process of interest. In addition, the batch query tool allows users to upload long list(s) of molecules, such as those derived from microarray experiments, and either overlay these molecules onto predefined pathways or visualize the complete molecular connectivity map. Users can also download molecule lists, citation lists and complete database content in extensible markup language (XML) and Biological Pathways Exchange (BioPAX) Level 2 format. The database is updated with new pathway content every month and supplemented by specially commissioned articles on the practical uses of other relevant online tools.
In addition to maintaining the GenBank® nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides analysis and retrieval resources for the data in GenBank and other biological data made available through the NCBI web site. NCBI resources include Entrez, the Entrez Programming Utilities, MyNCBI, PubMed, PubMed Central, Entrez Gene, the NCBI Taxonomy Browser, BLAST, BLAST Link (BLink), Electronic PCR, OrfFinder, Spidey, Splign, RefSeq, UniGene, HomoloGene, ProtEST, dbMHC, dbSNP, Cancer Chromosomes, Entrez Genomes and related tools, the Map Viewer, Model Maker, Evidence Viewer, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs), Retroviral Genotyping Tools, HIV-1/Human Protein Interaction Database, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Entrez Probe, GENSAT, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA), the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), the Conserved Domain Database (CDD), the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART) and the PubChem suite of small molecule databases. Augmenting many of the web applications is custom implementation of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets. All of the resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
SpBase is a system of databases focused on the genomic information from sea urchins and related echinoderms. It is exposed to the public through a web site served with open source software (http://spbase.org/). The enterprise was undertaken to provide an easily used collection of information to directly support experimental work on these useful research models in cell and developmental biology. The information served from the databases emerges from the draft genomic sequence of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and includes sequence data and genomic resource descriptions for other members of the echinoderm clade which in total span 540 million years of evolutionary time. This version of the system contains two assemblies of the purple sea urchin genome, associated expressed sequences, gene annotations and accessory resources. Search mechanisms for the sequences and the gene annotations are provided. Because the system is maintained along with the Sea Urchin Genome resource, a database of sequenced clones is also provided.
We present a database DOOR (Database for prOkaryotic OpeRons) containing computationally predicted operons of all the sequenced prokaryotic genomes. All the operons in DOOR are predicted using our own prediction program, which was ranked to be the best among 14 operon prediction programs by a recent independent review. Currently, the DOOR database contains operons for 675 prokaryotic genomes, and supports a number of search capabilities to facilitate easy access and utilization of the information stored in it. Querying the database: the database provides a search capability for a user to find desired operons and associated information through multiple querying methods.Searching for similar operons: the database provides a search capability for a user to find operons that have similar composition and structure to a query operon.Prediction of cis-regulatory motifs: the database provides a capability for motif identification in the promoter regions of a user-specified group of possibly coregulated operons, using motif-finding tools.Operons for RNA genes: the database includes operons for RNA genes.OperonWiki: the database provides a wiki page (OperonWiki) to facilitate interactions between users and the developer of the database. We believe that DOOR provides a useful resource to many biologists working on bacteria and archaea, which can be accessed at http://csbl1.bmb.uga.edu/OperonDB.
FLYSNPdb provides high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of Drosophila melanogaster. The database currently contains 27 367 polymorphisms, including >3700 indels (insertions/deletions), covering all major chromsomes. These SNPs are clustered into 2238 markers, which are evenly distributed with an average density of one marker every 50.3 kb or 6.6 genes. SNPs were identified automatically, filtered for high quality and partly manually curated. The database provides detailed information on the SNP data including molecular and cytological locations (genome Releases 3–5), alleles of up to five commonly used laboratory stocks, flanking sequences, SNP marker amplification primers, quality scores and genotyping assays. Data specific for a certain region, particular stocks or a certain genome assembly version are easily retrievable through the interface of a publicly accessible website (http://flysnp.imp.ac.at/flysnpdb.php).
Neuroscience databases linking genes, proteins, (patho)physiology, anatomy and behaviour across species will be valuable in a broad range of studies of the nervous system. G2Cdb is such a neuroscience database aiming to present a global view of the role of synapse proteins in physiology and disease. G2Cdb warehouses sets of genes and proteins experimentally elucidated by proteomic mass spectroscopy of signalling complexes and proteins biochemically isolated from mammalian synapse preparations, giving an experimentally validated definition of the constituents of the mammalian synapse. Using automated text-mining and expert (human) curation we have systematically extracted information from published neurobiological studies in the fields of synaptic signalling electrophysiology and behaviour in knockout and other transgenic mice. We have also surveyed the human genetics literature for associations to disease caused by mutations in synaptic genes. The synapse proteome datasets that G2Cdb provides offer a basis for future work in synapse biology and provide useful information on brain diseases. They have been integrated in a such way that investigators can rapidly query whether a gene or protein is found in brain-signalling complex(es), has a phenotype in rodent models or whether mutations are associated with a human disease. G2Cdb can be freely accessed at http://www.genes2cognition.org.
Phylogenetic patterns show the presence or absence of certain genes in a set of full genomes derived from different species. They can also be used to determine sets of genes that occur only in certain evolutionary branches. Previously, we presented a database named PhyloPat which allows the complete Ensembl gene database to be queried using phylogenetic patterns. Here, we describe an updated version of PhyloPat which can be queried by an improved web server. We used a single linkage clustering algorithm to create 241 697 phylogenetic lineages, using all the orthologies provided by Ensembl v49. PhyloPat offers the possibility of querying with binary phylogenetic patterns or regular expressions, or through a phylogenetic tree of the 39 included species. Users can also input a list of Ensembl, EMBL, EntrezGene or HGNC IDs to check which phylogenetic lineage any gene belongs to. A link to the FatiGO web interface has been incorporated in the HTML output. For each gene, the surrounding genes on the chromosome, color coded according to their phylogenetic lineage can be viewed, as well as FASTA files of the peptide sequences of each lineage. Furthermore, lists of omnipresent, polypresent, oligopresent and anticorrelating genes have been included. PhyloPat is freely available at http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/phylopat.
The regulation of protein function through reversible phosphorylation by protein kinases and phosphatases is a general mechanism controlling virtually every cellular activity. Eukaryotic protein kinases can be classified into distinct, well-characterized groups based on amino acid sequence similarity and function. We recently reported a highly sensitive and accurate hidden Markov model-based method for the automatic detection and classification of protein kinases into these specific groups. The Kinomer v. 1.0 database presented here contains annotated classifications for the protein kinase complements of 43 eukaryotic genomes. These span the taxonomic range and include fungi (16 species), plants (6), diatoms (1), amoebas (2), protists (1) and animals (17). The kinomes are stored in a relational database and are accessible through a web interface on the basis of species, kinase group or a combination of both. In addition, the Kinomer v. 1.0 HMM library is made available for users to perform classification on arbitrary sequences. The Kinomer v. 1.0 database is a continually updated resource where direct comparison of kinase sequences across kinase groups and across species can give insights into kinase function and evolution. Kinomer v. 1.0 is available at http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/kinomer/.
Reactome (http://www.reactome.org) is an expert-authored, peer-reviewed knowledgebase of human reactions and pathways that functions as a data mining resource and electronic textbook. Its current release includes 2975 human proteins, 2907 reactions and 4455 literature citations. A new entity-level pathway viewer and improved search and data mining tools facilitate searching and visualizing pathway data and the analysis of user-supplied high-throughput data sets. Reactome has increased its utility to the model organism communities with improved orthology prediction methods allowing pathway inference for 22 species and through collaborations to create manually curated Reactome pathway datasets for species including Arabidopsis, Oryza sativa (rice), Drosophila and Gallus gallus (chicken). Reactome's data content and software can all be freely used and redistributed under open source terms.
The UCSC Genome Browser Database (GBD, http://genome.ucsc.edu) is a publicly available collection of genome assembly sequence data and integrated annotations for a large number of organisms, including extensive comparative-genomic resources. In the past year, 13 new genome assemblies have been added, including two important primate species, orangutan and marmoset, bringing the total to 46 assemblies for 24 different vertebrates and 39 assemblies for 22 different invertebrate animals. The GBD datasets may be viewed graphically with the UCSC Genome Browser, which uses a coordinate-based display system allowing users to juxtapose a wide variety of data. These data include all mRNAs from GenBank mapped to all organisms, RefSeq alignments, gene predictions, regulatory elements, gene expression data, repeats, SNPs and other variation data, as well as pairwise and multiple-genome alignments. A variety of other bioinformatics tools are also provided, including BLAT, the Table Browser, the Gene Sorter, the Proteome Browser, VisiGene and Genome Graphs.
ConSurf-DB is a repository for evolutionary conservation analysis of the proteins of known structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Sequence homologues of each of the PDB entries were collected and aligned using standard methods. The evolutionary conservation of each amino acid position in the alignment was calculated using the Rate4Site algorithm, implemented in the ConSurf web server. The algorithm takes into account the phylogenetic relations between the aligned proteins and the stochastic nature of the evolutionary process explicitly. Rate4Site assigns a conservation level for each position in the multiple sequence alignment using an empirical Bayesian inference. Visual inspection of the conservation patterns on the 3D structure often enables the identification of key residues that comprise the functionally important regions of the protein. The repository is updated with the latest PDB entries on a monthly basis and will be rebuilt annually. ConSurf-DB is available online at http://consurfdb.tau.ac.il/
The Génolevures online database (http://cbi.labri.fr/Genolevures/ and http://genolevures.org/) provides exploratory tools and curated data sets relative to nine complete and seven partial genome sequences determined and manually annotated by the Génolevures Consortium, to facilitate comparative genomic studies of Hemiascomycete yeasts. The 2008 update to the Génolevures database provides four new genomes in complete (subtelomere to subtelomere) chromosome sequences, 50 000 protein-coding and tRNA genes, and in silico analyses for each gene element. A key element is a novel classification of conserved multi-species protein families and their use in detecting synteny, gene fusions and other aspects of genome remodeling in evolution. Our purpose is to release high-quality curated data from complete genomes, with a focus on the relations between genes, genomes and proteins.
Rfam is a collection of RNA sequence families, represented by multiple sequence alignments and covariance models (CMs). The primary aim of Rfam is to annotate new members of known RNA families on nucleotide sequences, particularly complete genomes, using sensitive BLAST filters in combination with CMs. A minority of families with a very broad taxonomic range (e.g. tRNA and rRNA) provide the majority of the sequence annotations, whilst the majority of Rfam families (e.g. snoRNAs and miRNAs) have a limited taxonomic range and provide a limited number of annotations. Recent improvements to the website, methodologies and data used by Rfam are discussed. Rfam is freely available on the Web at http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/and http://rfam.janelia.org/.
Streptococci are the causative agent of many human infectious diseases including bacterial pneumonia and meningitis. Here, we present Strepto-DB, a database for the comparative genome analysis of group A (GAS) and group B (GBS) streptococci. The known genomes of various GAS and GBS contain a large fraction of distributed genes that were found absent in other strains or serotypes of the same species. Strepto-DB identifies the homologous proteins deduced from the genomes of interest. It allows for the elucidation of the GAS and GBS core- and pan-genomes via genome-wide comparisons. Moreover, an intergenic region analysis tool provides alignments and predictions for transcription factor binding sites in the non-coding sequences. An interactive genome browser visualizes functional annotations. Strepto-DB (http://oger.tu-bs.de/strepto_db) was created by the use of OGeR, the Open Genome Resource for comparative analysis of prokaryotic genomes. OGeR is a newly developed open source database and tool platform for the web-based storage, distribution, visualization and comparison of prokaryotic genome data. The system automatically creates the dedicated relational database and web interface and imports an arbitrary number of genomes derived from standardized genome files. OGeR can be downloaded at http://oger.tu-bs.de.
Gene transcription is largely regulated by sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). The TF activity is significantly regulated by its posttranslational modifications (PTMs). TF-PTMs serve as ‘molecular switchboards’ that map multiple upstream signaling events, in response to various environmental perturbations, to the downstream transcriptional events. While many instances of TF-PTMs and their effect on gene regulation have been experimentally determined, a systematic meta-analysis or a quantitative model-based investigation of this process has not been undertaken. A prerequisite to such analyses is a database of known instances of TF-PTMs affecting transcriptional regulation. The PTM-Switchboard database meets this need by cataloging such instances in the model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The database stores triplets of genes such that the ability of one gene (TF) to regulate a target gene is dependent on one or more PTMs catalyzed by a third gene (modifying enzyme). The database currently includes a large sample of experimentally characterized instances curated from the literature. In addition to providing a framework for searching and analyzing the data, the database will serve to benchmark computational methods. In the future, the database will be expanded to mammalian organisms, and will also include triplets predicted from computational approaches. The database can be accessed at http://cagr.pcbi.upenn.edu/PTMswitchboard.
MMsINC (http://mms.dsfarm.unipd.it/MMsINC/search) is a database of non-redundant, richly annotated and biomedically relevant chemical structures. A primary goal of MMsINC is to guarantee the highest quality and the uniqueness of each entry. MMsINC then adds value to these entries by including the analysis of crucial chemical properties, such as ionization and tautomerization processes, and the in silico prediction of 24 important molecular properties in the biochemical profile of each structure. MMsINC is consequently a natural input for different chemoinformatics and virtual screening applications. In addition, MMsINC supports various types of queries, including substructure queries and the novel ‘molecular scissoring’ query. MMsINC is interfaced with other primary data collectors, such as PubChem, Protein Data Bank (PDB), the Food and Drug Administration database of approved drugs and ZINC.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people. Both environmental and genetic factors play important roles in its causation and development. Genetic analysis has shown that over 100 genes are correlated with the etiology and pathology of PD. However, accessing genetic information in a consistent and fruitful way is not an easy task. The Mutation Database for Parkinson's Disease (MDPD) is designed to fulfill the need for information integration so that users can easily retrieve, inspect and enhance their knowledge on PD. The database contains 2391 entries on 202 genes extracted from 576 publications and manually examined by biomedical researchers. Each genetic substitution and the resulting impact are clearly labelled and linked to its primary reference. Every reported gene has a summary page that provides information on the variation impact, mutation type, the studied population, mutation position and reference collection. In addition, MDPD provides a unique functionality for users to compare the differences on the type of mutations among ethnic groups. As such, we hope that MDPD will serve as a valuable tool to bridge the gap between genetic analysis and clinical practice. MDPD is publicly accessible at http://datam.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/mdpd/.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-protein coding RNAs that direct the widespread phenomenon of post-transcriptional regulation of metazoan genes. The mature ∼22-nt long RNA molecules are processed from genome-encoded stem-loop structured precursor genes. Hundreds of such genes have been experimentally validated in vertebrate genomes, yet their discovery remains challenging, and substantially higher numbers have been estimated. The miROrtho database (http://cegg.unige.ch/mirortho) presents the results of a comprehensive computational survey of miRNA gene candidates across the majority of sequenced metazoan genomes. We designed and applied a three-tier analysis pipeline: (i) an SVM-based ab initio screen for potent hairpins, plus homologs of known miRNAs, (ii) an orthology delineation procedure and (iii) an SVM-based classifier of the ortholog multiple sequence alignments. The web interface provides direct access to putative miRNA annotations, ortholog multiple alignments, RNA secondary structure conservation, and sequence data. The miROrtho data are conceptually complementary to the miRBase catalog of experimentally verified miRNA sequences, providing a consistent comparative genomics perspective as well as identifying many novel miRNA genes with strong evolutionary support.
SWISS-MODEL Repository (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/) is a database of 3D protein structure models generated by the SWISS-MODEL homology-modelling pipeline. The aim of the SWISS-MODEL Repository is to provide access to an up-to-date collection of annotated 3D protein models generated by automated homology modelling for all sequences in Swiss-Prot and for relevant models organisms. Regular updates ensure that target coverage is complete, that models are built using the most recent sequence and template structure databases, and that improvements in the underlying modelling pipeline are fully utilised. As of September 2008, the database contains 3.4 million entries for 2.7 million different protein sequences from the UniProt database. SWISS-MODEL Repository allows the users to assess the quality of the models in the database, search for alternative template structures, and to build models interactively via SWISS-MODEL Workspace (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/workspace/). Annotation of models with functional information and cross-linking with other databases such as the Protein Model Portal (http://www.proteinmodelportal.org) of the PSI Structural Genomics Knowledge Base facilitates the navigation between protein sequence and structure resources.
We have developed ExDom, a unique database for the comparative analysis of the exon–intron structures of 96 680 protein domains from seven eukaryotic organisms (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Bos taurus, Rattus norvegicus, Danio rerio, Gallus gallus and Arabidopsis thaliana). ExDom provides integrated access to exon-domain data through a sophisticated web interface which has the following analytical capabilities: (i) intergenomic and intragenomic comparative analysis of exon–intron structure of domains; (ii) color-coded graphical display of the domain architecture of proteins correlated with their corresponding exon-intron structures; (iii) graphical analysis of multiple sequence alignments of amino acid and coding nucleotide sequences of homologous protein domains from seven organisms; (iv) comparative graphical display of exon distributions within the tertiary structures of protein domains; and (v) visualization of exon–intron structures of alternative transcripts of a gene correlated to variations in the domain architecture of corresponding protein isoforms. These novel analytical features are highly suited for detailed investigations on the exon–intron structure of domains and make ExDom a powerful tool for exploring several key questions concerning the function, origin and evolution of genes and proteins. ExDom database is freely accessible at: http://66.170.16.154/ExDom/.
The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) provides researchers with quality-controlled bacterial and archaeal small subunit rRNA alignments and analysis tools. An improved alignment strategy uses the Infernal secondary structure aware aligner to provide a more consistent higher quality alignment and faster processing of user sequences. Substantial new analysis features include a new Pyrosequencing Pipeline that provides tools to support analysis of ultra high-throughput rRNA sequencing data. This pipeline offers a collection of tools that automate the data processing and simplify the computationally intensive analysis of large sequencing libraries. In addition, a new Taxomatic visualization tool allows rapid visualization of taxonomic inconsistencies and suggests corrections, and a new class Assignment Generator provides instructors with a lesson plan and individualized teaching materials. Details about RDP data and analytical functions can be found at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/.
The InterPro database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) integrates together predictive models or ‘signatures’ representing protein domains, families and functional sites from multiple, diverse source databases: Gene3D, PANTHER, Pfam, PIRSF, PRINTS, ProDom, PROSITE, SMART, SUPERFAMILY and TIGRFAMs. Integration is performed manually and approximately half of the total ∼58 000 signatures available in the source databases belong to an InterPro entry. Recently, we have started to also display the remaining un-integrated signatures via our web interface. Other developments include the provision of non-signature data, such as structural data, in new XML files on our FTP site, as well as the inclusion of matchless UniProtKB proteins in the existing match XML files. The web interface has been extended and now links out to the ADAN predicted protein–protein interaction database and the SPICE and Dasty viewers. The latest public release (v18.0) covers 79.8% of UniProtKB (v14.1) and consists of 16 549 entries. InterPro data may be accessed either via the web address above, via web services, by downloading files by anonymous FTP or by using the InterProScan search software (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/).
The Genomes TO Protein Structures and Functions (GTOP) database (http://spock.genes.nig.ac.jp/~genome/gtop.html) freely provides an extensive collection of information on protein structures and functions obtained by application of various computational tools to the amino acid sequences of entirely sequenced genomes. GTOP contains annotations of 3D structures, protein families, functions, and other useful data of a protein of interest in user-friendly ways to give a deep insight into the protein structure. From the initial 1999 version, GTOP has been continually updated to reap the fruits of genome projects and augmented to supply novel information, in particular intrinsically disordered regions. As intrinsically disordered regions constitute a considerable fraction of proteins and often play crucial roles especially in eukaryotes, their assignments give important additional clues to the functionality of proteins. Additionally, we have incorporated the following features into GTOP: a platform independent structural viewer, results of HMM searches against SCOP and Pfam, secondary structure predictions, color display of exon boundaries in eukaryotic proteins, assignments of gene ontology terms, search tools, and master files.
SchistoDB (http://schistoDB.net/) is a genomic database for the parasitic organism Schistosoma mansoni, one of the major causative agents of schistosomiasis worldwide. It currently incorporates sequences and annotation for S. mansoni in a single user-friendly database. Several genomic scale analyses are available as well as ESTs, oligonucleotides, metabolic pathways and drugs. In this article, we describe the data sets and its analyses, how to query the database and tools available in the website.
PlasmoDB (http://PlasmoDB.org) is a functional genomic database for Plasmodium spp. that provides a resource for data analysis and visualization in a gene-by-gene or genome-wide scale. PlasmoDB belongs to a family of genomic resources that are housed under the EuPathDB (http://EuPathDB.org) Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) umbrella. The latest release, PlasmoDB 5.5, contains numerous new data types from several broad categories—annotated genomes, evidence of transcription, proteomics evidence, protein function evidence, population biology and evolution. Data in PlasmoDB can be queried by selecting the data of interest from a query grid or drop down menus. Various results can then be combined with each other on the query history page. Search results can be downloaded with associated functional data and registered users can store their query history for future retrieval or analysis.
The Rat Genome Database (RGD, http://rgd.mcw.edu) was developed to provide a core resource for rat researchers combining genetic, genomic, pathway, phenotype and strain information with a focus on disease. RGD users are provided with access to structured and curated data from the molecular level through to the level of the whole organism, including the variations associated with disease phenotypes. To fully support use of the rat as a translational model for biological systems and human disease, RGD continues to curate these datasets while enhancing and developing tools to allow efficient and effective access to the data in a variety of formats including linear genome viewers, pathway diagrams and biological ontologies. To support pathophysiological analysis of data, RGD Disease Portals provide an entryway to integrated gene, QTL and strain data specific to a particular disease. In addition to tool and content development and maintenance, RGD promotes rat research and provides user education by creating and disseminating tutorials on the curated datasets, submission processes, and tools available at RGD. By curating, storing, integrating, visualizing and promoting rat data, RGD ensures that the investment made into rat genomics and genetics can be leveraged by all interested investigators.
Active research on the biology of the centrosome during the past decades has allowed the identification and characterization of many centrosomal proteins. Unfortunately, the accumulated data is still dispersed among heterogeneous sources of information. Here we present centrosome:db, which intends to compile and integrate relevant information related to the human centrosome. We have compiled a set of 383 likely human centrosomal genes and recorded the associated supporting evidences. Centrosome:db offers several perspectives to study the human centrosome including evolution, function and structure. The database contains information on the orthology relationships with other species, including fungi, nematodes, arthropods, urochordates and vertebrates. Predictions of the domain organization of centrosome:db proteins are graphically represented at different sections of the database, including sets of alternative protein isoforms, interacting proteins, groups of orthologs and the homologs identified with blast. Centrosome:db also contains information related to function, gene–disease associations, SNPs and the 3D structure of proteins. Apart from important differences in the coverage of the set of centrosomal genes, our database differentiates from other similar initiatives in the way information is treated and analyzed. Centrosome:db is publicly available at http://centrosome.dacya.ucm.es.
Peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.x), which are encoded by small or large multigenic families, are involved in several important physiological and developmental processes. They use various peroxides as electron acceptors to catalyse a number of oxidative reactions and are present in almost all living organisms. We have created a peroxidase database (http://peroxibase.isb-sib.ch) that contains all identified peroxidase-encoding sequences (about 6000 sequences in 940 organisms). They are distributed between 11 superfamilies and about 60 subfamilies. All the sequences have been individually annotated and checked. PeroxiBase can be consulted using six major interlink sections ‘Classes’, ‘Organisms’, ‘Cellular localisations’, ‘Inducers’, ‘Repressors’ and ‘Tissue types’. General documentation on peroxidases and PeroxiBase is accessible in the ‘Documents’ section containing ‘Introduction’, ‘Class description’, ‘Publications’ and ‘Links’. In addition to the database, we have developed a tool to classify peroxidases based on the PROSITE profile methodology. To improve their specificity and to prevent overlaps between closely related subfamilies the profiles were built using a new strategy based on the silencing of residues. This new profile construction method and its discriminatory capacity have been tested and validated using the different peroxidase families and subfamilies present in the database. The peroxidase classification tool called PeroxiScan is accessible at the following address: http://peroxibase.isb-sib.ch/peroxiscan.php.
The Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) project at the EBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goa) provides high-quality electronic and manual associations (annotations) of Gene Ontology (GO) terms to UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) entries. Annotations created by the project are collated with annotations from external databases to provide an extensive, publicly available GO annotation resource. Currently covering over 160 000 taxa, with greater than 32 million annotations, GOA remains the largest and most comprehensive open-source contributor to the GO Consortium (GOC) project. Over the last five years, the group has augmented the number and coverage of their electronic pipelines and a number of new manual annotation projects and collaborations now further enhance this resource. A range of files facilitate the download of annotations for particular species, and GO term information and associated annotations can also be viewed and downloaded from the newly developed GOA QuickGO tool (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO), which allows users to precisely tailor their annotation set.
Circular permutation (CP) in a protein can be considered as if its sequence were circularized followed by a creation of termini at a new location. Since the first observation of CP in 1979, a substantial number of studies have concluded that circular permutants (CPs) usually retain native structures and functions, sometimes with increased stability or functional diversity. Although this interesting property has made CP useful in many protein engineering and folding researches, large-scale collections of CP-related information were not available until this study. Here we describe CPDB, the first CP DataBase. The organizational principle of CPDB is a hierarchical categorization in which pairs of circular permutants are grouped into CP clusters, which are further grouped into folds and in turn classes. Additions to CPDB include a useful set of tools and resources for the identification, characterization, comparison and visualization of CP. Besides, several viable CP site prediction methods are implemented and assessed in CPDB. This database can be useful in protein folding and evolution studies, the discovery of novel protein structural and functional relationships, and facilitating the production of new CPs with unique biotechnical or industrial interests. The CPDB database can be accessed at http://sarst.life.nthu.edu.tw/cpdb
We propose here KineticDB, a systematically compiled database of protein folding kinetics, which contains about 90 unique proteins. The main goal of the KineticDB is to provide users with a diverse set of protein folding rates determined experimentally. The search for determinants of protein folding is still in progress, aimed at obtaining a new understanding of the folding process. Comparison with experimental protein folding rates has been the main tool for validation of both theoretical models and empirical relationships during the last 10 years. It is, therefore, necessary to provide a researcher with as much data as possible in a simple and easy-to-use way. At present, the KineticDB contains the results of folding kinetics measurements of single-domain proteins and separate protein domains as well as short peptides without disulfide bonds. It includes data on about 90 unique proteins and many mutants that have been systematically accumulated over the last 10 years and is the largest collection of protein folding kinetic data presented as a database. The KineticDB is available at http://kineticdb.protres.ru/db/index.pl.
The fast pace of bacterial genome sequencing and the resulting dependence on highly automated annotation methods has driven the development of many genome-wide analysis tools. OperonDB, first released in 2001, is a database containing the results of a computational algorithm for locating operon structures in microbial genomes. OperonDB has grown from 34 genomes in its initial release to more than 500 genomes today. In addition to increasing the size of the database, we have re-designed our operon finding algorithm and improved its accuracy. The new database is updated regularly as additional genomes become available in public archives. OperonDB can be accessed at: http://operondb.cbcb.umd.edu
Ovarian cancer (OC) is becoming the most common gynecological cancer in developed countries and the most lethal gynecological malignancy. It is also the fifth leading cause of all cancer-related deaths in women. The identification of diagnostic biomarkers and development of early detection techniques for OC largely depends on the understanding of the complex functionality and regulation of genes involved in this disease. Unfortunately, information about these OC genes is scattered throughout the literature and various databases making extraction of relevant functional information a complex task. To reduce this problem, we have developed a database dedicated to OC genes to support exploration of functional characterization and analysis of biological processes related to OC. The database contains general information about OC genes, enriched with the results of transcription regulation sequence analysis and with relevant text mining to provide insights into associations of the OC genes with other genes, metabolites, pathways and nuclear proteins. Overall, it enables exploration of relevant information for OC genes from multiple angles, making it a unique resource for OC and will serve as a useful complement to the existing public resources for those interested in OC genetics. Access is free for academic and non-profit users and database can be accessed at http://apps.sanbi.ac.za/ddoc/.
MODOMICS, a database devoted to the systems biology of RNA modification, has been subjected to substantial improvements. It provides comprehensive information on the chemical structure of modified nucleosides, pathways of their biosynthesis, sequences of RNAs containing these modifications and RNA-modifying enzymes. MODOMICS also provides cross-references to other databases and to literature. In addition to the previously available manually curated tRNA sequences from a few model organisms, we have now included additional tRNAs and rRNAs, and all RNAs with 3D structures in the Nucleic Acid Database, in which modified nucleosides are present. In total, 3460 modified bases in RNA sequences of different organisms have been annotated. New RNA-modifying enzymes have been also added. The current collection of enzymes includes mainly proteins for the model organisms Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and is currently being expanded to include proteins from other organisms, in particular Archaea and Homo sapiens. For enzymes with known structures, links are provided to the corresponding Protein Data Bank entries, while for many others homology models have been created. Many new options for database searching and querying have been included. MODOMICS can be accessed at http://genesilico.pl/modomics.
Influenza epidemics arise through the acquisition of viral genetic changes to overcome immunity from previous infections. An increasing number of complete genomes of influenza viruses have been sequenced in Asia in recent years. Knowledge about the genomes of the seasonal influenza viruses from different countries in Asia is valuable for monitoring and understanding of the emergence, migration and evolution of strains. In order to make full use of the wealth of information from such data, we have developed an integrated user friendly relational database, Influenza Sequence and Epitope Database (ISED), that catalogs the influenza sequence and epitope information obtained in Asia. ISED currently hosts a total of 13 020 influenza A and 2984 influenza B virus sequence data collected in 17 countries including 9 Asian countries, and a total of approximately 545 amantadine-resistant influenza virus sequences collected in Korea. ISED provides users with prebuilt application tools to analyze sequence alignment and different patterns and allows users to visualize epitope-matching structures, which is freely accessible at http://influenza.korea.ac.kr and http://influenza.cdc.go.kr.
EcoCyc (http://EcoCyc.org) provides a comprehensive encyclopedia of Escherichia coli biology. EcoCyc integrates information about the genome, genes and gene products; the metabolic network; and the regulatory network of E. coli. Recent EcoCyc developments include a new initiative to represent and curate all types of E. coli regulatory processes such as attenuation and regulation by small RNAs. EcoCyc has started to curate Gene Ontology (GO) terms for E. coli and has made a dataset of E. coli GO terms available through the GO Web site. The curation and visualization of electron transfer processes has been significantly improved. Other software and Web site enhancements include the addition of tracks to the EcoCyc genome browser, in particular a type of track designed for the display of ChIP-chip datasets, and the development of a comparative genome browser. A new Genome Omics Viewer enables users to paint omics datasets onto the full E. coli genome for analysis. A new advanced query page guides users in interactively constructing complex database queries against EcoCyc. A Macintosh version of EcoCyc is now available. A series of Webinars is available to instruct users in the use of EcoCyc. 
Knowledge of the kinetics of biomolecular interactions is important for facilitating the study of cellular processes and underlying molecular events, and is essential for quantitative study and simulation of biological systems. Kinetic Data of Bio-molecular Interaction database (KDBI) has been developed to provide information about experimentally determined kinetic data of protein–protein, protein–nucleic acid, protein–ligand, nucleic acid–ligand binding or reaction events described in the literature. To accommodate increasing demand for studying and simulating biological systems, numerous improvements and updates have been made to KDBI, including new ways to access data by pathway and molecule names, data file in System Biology Markup Language format, more efficient search engine, access to published parameter sets of simulation models of 63 pathways, and 2.3-fold increase of data (19 263 entries of 10 532 distinctive biomolecular binding and 11 954 interaction events, involving 2635 proteins/protein complexes, 847 nucleic acids, 1603 small molecules and 45 multi-step processes). KDBI is publically available at http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/kdbi/kdbi.asp.
The Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme (CAZy) database is a knowledge-based resource specialized in the enzymes that build and breakdown complex carbohydrates and glycoconjugates. As of September 2008, the database describes the present knowledge on 113 glycoside hydrolase, 91 glycosyltransferase, 19 polysaccharide lyase, 15 carbohydrate esterase and 52 carbohydrate-binding module families. These families are created based on experimentally characterized proteins and are populated by sequences from public databases with significant similarity. Protein biochemical information is continuously curated based on the available literature and structural information. Over 6400 proteins have assigned EC numbers and 700 proteins have a PDB structure. The classification (i) reflects the structural features of these enzymes better than their sole substrate specificity, (ii) helps to reveal the evolutionary relationships between these enzymes and (iii) provides a convenient framework to understand mechanistic properties. This resource has been available for over 10 years to the scientific community, contributing to information dissemination and providing a transversal nomenclature to glycobiologists. More recently, this resource has been used to improve the quality of functional predictions of a number genome projects by providing expert annotation. The CAZy resource resides at URL: http://www.cazy.org/.
DNAReplication (at http://www.dnareplication.net) has been set up as a freely available single resource to facilitate access to information on eukaryotic DNA replication. This database summarizes organism-sorted data on replication proteins in the categories of nomenclature, biochemical properties, motifs, interactions, modifications, structure, cell localization and expression, and general comments. Replication concepts are defined and a general model of the steps in DNA replication is presented. Links to relevant websites and homepages of replication labs are provided. The site also has an interactive section where links to recent replication papers are posted and readers are provided with the facility to post comments about each paper. The interactive and links pages are modified weekly and the whole site is updated annually.
We introduce the CC+ Database, a detailed, searchable repository of coiled-coil assignments, which is freely available at http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/ccplus. Coiled coils were identified using the program SOCKET, which locates coiled coils based on knobs-into-holes packing of side chains between α-helices. A method for determining the overall sequence identity of coiled-coil sequences was introduced to reduce statistical bias inherent in coiled-coil data sets. There are two points of entry into the CC+ Database: the ‘Periodic Table of Coiled-coil Structures’, which presents a graphical path through coiled-coil space based on manually validated data, and the ‘Dynamic Interface’, which allows queries of the database at different levels of complexity and detail. The latter entry level, which is the focus of this article, enables the efficient and rapid compilation of subsets of coiled-coil structures. These can be created and interrogated with increasingly sophisticated pull-down, keyword and sequence-based searches to return detailed structural and sequence information. Also provided are means for outputting the retrieved coiled-coil data in various formats, including PyMOL and RasMol scripts, and Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (or amino-acid profiles), which may be used, for example, in protein-structure prediction.
FlyBase (http://flybase.org) is a database of Drosophila genetic and genomic information. Gene Ontology (GO) terms are used to describe three attributes of wild-type gene products: their molecular function, the biological processes in which they play a role, and their subcellular location. This article describes recent changes to the FlyBase GO annotation strategy that are improving the quality of the GO annotation data. Many of these changes stem from our participation in the GO Reference Genome Annotation Project—a multi-database collaboration producing comprehensive GO annotation sets for 12 diverse species.
Essential genes are those indispensable for the survival of an organism, and their functions are therefore considered a foundation of life. Determination of a minimal gene set needed to sustain a life form, a fundamental question in biology, plays a key role in the emerging field, synthetic biology. Five years after we constructed DEG, a database of essential genes, DEG 5.0 has significant advances over the 2004 version in both the number of essential genes and the number of organisms in which these genes are determined. The number of prokaryotic essential genes in DEG has increased about 10-fold, mainly owing to genome-wide gene essentiality screens performed in a wide range of bacteria. The number of eukaryotic essential genes has increased more than 5-fold, because DEG 1.0 only had yeast ones, but DEG 5.0 also has those in humans, mice, worms, fruit flies, zebrafish and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These updates not only represent significant advances of DEG, but also represent the rapid progress of the essential-gene field. DEG is freely available at the website http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg or http://www.essentialgene.org.
The vast accumulation of protein structural data has now facilitated the observation of many different complexes in the PDB for the same protein. Therefore, a single protein complex is not sufficient to identify their interaction sites, especially for proteins with multiple binding states or different partners, such as hub proteins. PiSite is a database that provides protein–protein interaction sites at the residue level with consideration of multiple complexes at the same time, by mapping the binding sites of all complexes containing the same protein in the PDB. PiSite provides easy web interfaces with an interactive viewer working with typical web browsers, and the different binding modes can be checked visually. All of the information can also be downloaded for further analyses. In addition, PiSite provides a list of proteins with multiple binding partners and multiple binding states, as well as up-to-date statistics of protein–protein interfaces. PiSite is available at http://pisite.hgc.jp
The degradome is defined as the complete set of proteases present in an organism. The recent availability of whole genomic sequences from multiple organisms has led us to predict the contents of the degradomes of several mammalian species. To ensure the fidelity of these predictions, our methods have included manual curation of individual sequences and, when necessary, direct cloning and sequencing experiments. The results of these studies in human, chimpanzee, mouse and rat have been incorporated into the Degradome database, which can be accessed through a web interface at http://degradome.uniovi.es. The annotations about each individual protease can be retrieved by browsing catalytic classes and families or by searching specific terms. This web site also provides detailed information about genetic diseases of proteolysis, a growing field of great importance for multiple users. Finally, the user can find additional information about protease structures, protease inhibitors, ancillary domains of proteases and differences between mammalian degradomes.
The TcSNP database (http://snps.tcruzi.org) integrates information on genetic variation (polymorphisms and mutations) for different stocks, strains and isolates of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The database incorporates sequences (genes from the T. cruzi reference genome, mRNAs, ESTs and genomic sequences); multiple sequence alignments obtained from these sequences; and single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small indels identified by scanning these multiple sequence alignments. Information in TcSNP can be readily interrogated to arrive at gene sets, or SNP sets of interest based on a number of attributes. Sequence similarity searches using BLAST are also supported. This first release of TcSNP contains nearly 170 000 high-confidence candidate SNPs, derived from the analysis of annotated coding sequences. As new sequence data become available, TcSNP will incorporate these data, mapping new candidate SNPs onto the reference genome sequences.
The increasing structural information about target-bound compounds provide a rich basis to study the binding mechanisms of metabolites and drugs. SuperSite is a database, which combines the structural information with various tools for the analysis of molecular recognition. The main data is made up of 8000 metabolites including 1300 drugs, bound to about 290 000 different receptor binding sites. The analysis tools include features, like the highlighting of evolutionary conserved receptor residues, the marking of putative binding pockets and the superpositioning of different binding sites of the same ligand. User-defined compounds can be edited or uploaded and will be superimposed with the most similar co-crystallized ligand. The user can examine all results online with the molecule viewer Jmol. An implemented search algorithm allows the screening of uploaded proteins, in order to detect potential drug binding sites, which are similar to known binding pockets. The huge data set of target-bound compounds in combination with the provided analysis tools allow to inspect the characteristics of molecular recognition, especially for drug target interactions. SuperSite is publicly available at: http://bioinformatics.charite.de/supersite.
The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB), freely accessible at http://www.tcdb.org, is a relational database containing sequence, structural, functional and evolutionary information about transport systems from a variety of living organisms, based on the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-approved transporter classification (TC) system. It is a curated repository for factual information compiled largely from published references. It uses a functional/phylogenetic system of classification, and currently encompasses about 5000 representative transporters and putative transporters in more than 500 families. We here describe novel software designed to support and extend the usefulness of TCDB. Our recent efforts render it more user friendly, incorporate machine learning to input novel data in a semiautomatic fashion, and allow analyses that are more accurate and less time consuming. The availability of these tools has resulted in recognition of distant phylogenetic relationships and tremendous expansion of the information available to TCDB users.
Recent advances in studies of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) has uncovered many new candidate genes and continues to do so at an accelerated pace. To address the genetic complexity of ASD, we have developed AutDB (http://www.mindspec.org/autdb.html), a publicly available web-portal for on-going collection, manual annotation and visualization of genes linked to the disorder. We present a disease-driven database model in AutDB where all genes connected to ASD are collected and classified according to their genetic variation: candidates identified from genetic association studies, rare single gene mutations and genes linked to syndromic autism. Gene entries are richly annotated for their relevance to autism, along with an in-depth view of their molecular functions. The content of AutDB originates entirely from the published scientific literature and is organized to optimize its use by the research community. The main focus of this resource is to provide an up-to-date, annotated list of ASD candidate genes in the form of reference dataset for interrogating molecular mechanisms underlying the disorder. Our model for consolidated knowledge representation in genetically complex disorders could be replicated to study other such disorders.
Although protein–peptide interactions are estimated to constitute up to 40% of all protein interactions, relatively little information is available for the structural details of these interactions. Peptide-mediated interactions are a prime target for drug design because they are predominantly present in signaling and regulatory networks. A reliable data set of nonredundant protein–peptide complexes is indispensable as a basis for modeling and design, but current data sets for protein–peptide interactions are often biased towards specific types of interactions or are limited to interactions with small ligands. In PepX (http://pepx.switchlab.org), we have designed an unbiased and exhaustive data set of all protein–peptide complexes available in the Protein Data Bank with peptide lengths up to 35 residues. In addition, these complexes have been clustered based on their binding interfaces rather than sequence homology, providing a set of structurally diverse protein–peptide interactions. The final data set contains 505 unique protein–peptide interface clusters from 1431 complexes. Thorough annotation of each complex with both biological and structural information facilitates searching for and browsing through individual complexes and clusters. Moreover, we provide an additional source of data for peptide design by annotating peptides with naturally occurring backbone variations using fragment clusters from the BriX database.
The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser website (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) provides a large database of publicly available sequence and annotation data along with an integrated tool set for examining and comparing the genomes of organisms, aligning sequence to genomes, and displaying and sharing users' own annotation data. As of September 2009, genomic sequence and a basic set of annotation ‘tracks’ are provided for 47 organisms, including 14 mammals, 10 non-mammal vertebrates, 3 invertebrate deuterostomes, 13 insects, 6 worms and a yeast. New data highlights this year include an updated human genome browser, a 44-species multiple sequence alignment track, improved variation and phenotype tracks and 16 new genome-wide ENCODE tracks. New features include drag-and-zoom navigation, a Wiki track for user-added annotations, new custom track formats for large datasets (bigBed and bigWig), a new multiple alignment output tool, links to variation and protein structure tools, in silico PCR utility enhancements, and improved track configuration tools.
The IRESite (http://www.iresite.org) presents carefully curated experimental evidence of many eukaryotic viral and cellular internal ribosome entry site (IRES) regions. At the time of submission, IRESite stored >600 records. The IRESite gradually evolved into a robust tool providing (i) biologically meaningful information regarding the IRESs and their experimental background (including annotation of IRES secondary structures and IRES trans-acting factors) as well as (ii) thorough concluding remarks to stored database entries and regularly updated evaluation of the reported IRES function. A substantial portion of the IRESite data results purely from in-house bioinformatic analyses of currently available sequences, in silico attempts to repeat published cloning experiments, DNA sequencing and restriction endonuclease verification of received plasmid DNA. We also present a newly implemented tool for displaying RNA secondary structures and for searching through the structures currently stored in the database. The Supplementary Data contains an updated list of reported IRESs.
The GenomeRNAi database (http://www.genomernai.org/) contains phenotypes from published cell-based RNA interference (RNAi) screens in Drosophila and Homo sapiens. The database connects observed phenotypes with annotations of targeted genes and information about the RNAi reagent used for the perturbation experiment. The availability of phenotypes from Drosophila and human screens also allows for phenotype searches across species. Besides reporting quantitative data from genome-scale screens, the new release of GenomeRNAi also enables reporting of data from microscopy experiments and curated phenotypes from published screens. In addition, the database provides an updated resource of RNAi reagents and their predicted quality that are available for the Drosophila and the human genome. The new version also facilitates the integration with other genomic data sets and contains expression profiling (RNA-Seq) data for several cell lines commonly used in RNAi experiments.
PRGdb is a web accessible open-source (http://www.prgdb.org) database that represents the first bioinformatic resource providing a comprehensive overview of resistance genes (R-genes) in plants. PRGdb holds more than 16 000 known and putative R-genes belonging to 192 plant species challenged by 115 different pathogens and linked with useful biological information. The complete database includes a set of 73 manually curated reference R-genes, 6308 putative R-genes collected from NCBI and 10463 computationally predicted putative R-genes. Thanks to a user-friendly interface, data can be examined using different query tools. A home-made prediction pipeline called Disease Resistance Analysis and Gene Orthology (DRAGO), based on reference R-gene sequence data, was developed to search for plant resistance genes in public datasets such as Unigene and Genbank. New putative R-gene classes containing unknown domain combinations were discovered and characterized. The development of the PRG platform represents an important starting point to conduct various experimental tasks. The inferred cross-link between genomic and phenotypic information allows access to a large body of information to find answers to several biological questions. The database structure also permits easy integration with other data types and opens up prospects for future implementations.
PROSITE consists of documentation entries describing protein domains, families and functional sites, as well as associated patterns and profiles to identify them. It is complemented by ProRule, a collection of rules based on profiles and patterns, which increases the discriminatory power of these profiles and patterns by providing additional information about functionally and/or structurally critical amino acids. PROSITE is largely used for the annotation of domain features of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries. Among the 983 (DNA-binding) domains, repeats and zinc fingers present in Swiss-Prot (release 57.8 of 22 September 2009), 696 (∼70%) are annotated with PROSITE descriptors using information from ProRule. In order to allow better functional characterization of domains, PROSITE developments focus on subfamily specific profiles and a new profile building method giving more weight to functionally important residues. Here, we describe AMSA, an annotated multiple sequence alignment format used to build a new generation of generalized profiles, the migration of ScanProsite to Vital-IT, a cluster of 633 CPUs, and the adoption of the Distributed Annotation System (DAS) to facilitate PROSITE data integration and interchange with other sources. The latest version of PROSITE (release 20.54, of 22 September 2009) contains 1308 patterns, 863 profiles and 869 ProRules. PROSITE is accessible at: http://www.expasy.org/prosite/.
Increasing numbers of proteins, nucleic acids and other molecular entities have been explored as therapeutic targets, hundreds of which are targets of approved and clinical trial drugs. Knowledge of these targets and corresponding drugs, particularly those in clinical uses and trials, is highly useful for facilitating drug discovery. Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) has been developed to provide information about therapeutic targets and corresponding drugs. In order to accommodate increasing demand for comprehensive knowledge about the primary targets of the approved, clinical trial and experimental drugs, numerous improvements and updates have been made to TTD. These updates include information about 348 successful, 292 clinical trial and 1254 research targets, 1514 approved, 1212 clinical trial and 2302 experimental drugs linked to their primary targets (3382 small molecule and 649 antisense drugs with available structure and sequence), new ways to access data by drug mode of action, recursive search of related targets or drugs, similarity target and drug searching, customized and whole data download, standardized target ID, and significant increase of data (1894 targets, 560 diseases and 5028 drugs compared with the 433 targets, 125 diseases and 809 drugs in the original release described in previous paper). This database can be accessed at http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/cjttd/TTD.asp.
The primary mission of UniProt is to support biological research by maintaining a stable, comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase, with extensive cross-references and querying interfaces freely accessible to the scientific community. UniProt is produced by the UniProt Consortium which consists of groups from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) and the Protein Information Resource (PIR). UniProt is comprised of four major components, each optimized for different uses: the UniProt Archive, the UniProt Knowledgebase, the UniProt Reference Clusters and the UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental Sequence Database. UniProt is updated and distributed every 3 weeks and can be accessed online for searches or download at http://www.uniprot.org.
Pathema (http://pathema.jcvi.org) is one of the eight Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) designed to serve as a core resource for the bio-defense and infectious disease research community. Pathema strives to support basic research and accelerate scientific progress for understanding, detecting, diagnosing and treating an established set of six target NIAID Category A–C pathogens: Category A priority pathogens; Bacillus anthracis and Clostridium botulinum, and Category B priority pathogens; Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Clostridium perfringens and Entamoeba histolytica. Each target pathogen is represented in one of four distinct clade-specific Pathema web resources and underlying databases developed to target the specific data and analysis needs of each scientific community. All publicly available complete genome projects of phylogenetically related organisms are also represented, providing a comprehensive collection of organisms for comparative analyses. Pathema facilitates the scientific exploration of genomic and related data through its integration with web-based analysis tools, customized to obtain, display, and compute results relevant to ongoing pathogen research. Pathema serves the bio-defense and infectious disease research community by disseminating data resulting from pathogen genome sequencing projects and providing access to the results of inter-genomic comparisons for these organisms.
CyanoBase (http://genome.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase) is the genome database for cyanobacteria, which are model organisms for photosynthesis. The database houses cyanobacteria species information, complete genome sequences, genome-scale experiment data, gene information, gene annotations and mutant information. In this version, we updated these datasets and improved the navigation and the visual display of the data views. In addition, a web service API now enables users to retrieve the data in various formats with other tools, seamlessly.
The Small Molecule Pathway Database (SMPDB) is an interactive, visual database containing more than 350 small-molecule pathways found in humans. More than 2/3 of these pathways (>280) are not found in any other pathway database. SMPDB is designed specifically to support pathway elucidation and pathway discovery in clinical metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and systems biology. SMPDB provides exquisitely detailed, hyperlinked diagrams of human metabolic pathways, metabolic disease pathways, metabolite signaling pathways and drug-action pathways. All SMPDB pathways include information on the relevant organs, organelles, subcellular compartments, protein cofactors, protein locations, metabolite locations, chemical structures and protein quaternary structures. Each small molecule is hyperlinked to detailed descriptions contained in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) or DrugBank and each protein or enzyme complex is hyperlinked to UniProt. All SMPDB pathways are accompanied with detailed descriptions, providing an overview of the pathway, condition or processes depicted in each diagram. The database is easily browsed and supports full text searching. Users may query SMPDB with lists of metabolite names, drug names, genes/protein names, SwissProt IDs, GenBank IDs, Affymetrix IDs or Agilent microarray IDs. These queries will produce lists of matching pathways and highlight the matching molecules on each of the pathway diagrams. Gene, metabolite and protein concentration data can also be visualized through SMPDB's mapping interface. All of SMPDB's images, image maps, descriptions and tables are downloadable. SMPDB is available at: http://www.smpdb.ca.
BeetleBase (http://www.beetlebase.org) has been updated to provide more comprehensive genomic information for the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. The database contains genomic sequence scaffolds mapped to 10 linkage groups (genome assembly release Tcas_3.0), genetic linkage maps, the official gene set, Reference Sequences from NCBI (RefSeq), predicted gene models, ESTs and whole-genome tiling array data representing several developmental stages. The database was reconstructed using the upgraded Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) modules. The genomic data is stored in a PostgreSQL relatational database using the Chado schema and visualized as tracks in GBrowse. The updated genetic map is visualized using the comparative genetic map viewer CMAP. To enhance the database search capabilities, the BLAST and BLAT search tools have been integrated with the GMOD tools. BeetleBase serves as a long-term repository for Tribolium genomic data, and is compatible with other model organism databases.
Peroxisomes are essential organelles that play a key role in redox signalling and lipid homeostasis. They contain a highly diverse enzymatic network among different species, mirroring the varied metabolic needs of the organisms. The previous PeroxisomeDB version organized the peroxisomal proteome of humans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on genetic and functional information into metabolic categories with a special focus on peroxisomal disease. The new release (http://www.peroxisomeDB.org) adds peroxisomal proteins from 35 newly sequenced eukaryotic genomes including fungi, yeasts, plants and lower eukaryotes. We searched these genomes for a core ensemble of 139 peroxisomal protein families and identified 2706 putative peroxisomal protein homologs. Approximately 37% of the identified homologs contained putative peroxisome targeting signals (PTS). To help develop understanding of the evolutionary relationships among peroxisomal proteins, the new database includes phylogenetic trees for 2386 of the peroxisomal proteins. Additional new features are provided, such as a tool to capture kinetic information from Brenda, CheBI and Sabio-RK databases and more than 1400 selected bibliographic references. PeroxisomeDB 2.0 is a freely available, highly interactive functional genomics platform that offers an extensive view on the peroxisomal metabolome across lineages, thus facilitating comparative genomics and systems analysis of the organelle.
Proteins often have several motifs with distinct evolutionary histories. Proteins with similar motifs have similar biochemical properties and thus related biological functions. We constructed a unique comparative genomics database termed the SALAD database (http://salad.dna.affrc.go.jp/salad/) from plant-genome-based proteome data sets. We extracted evolutionarily conserved motifs by MEME software from 209 529 protein-sequence annotation groups selected by BLASTP from the proteome data sets of 10 species: rice, sorghum, Arabidopsis thaliana, grape, a lycophyte, a moss, 3 algae, and yeast. Similarity clustering of each protein group was performed by pairwise scoring of the motif patterns of the sequences. The SALAD database provides a user-friendly graphical viewer that displays a motif pattern diagram linked to the resulting bootstrapped dendrogram for each protein group. Amino-acid-sequence-based and nucleotide-sequence-based phylogenetic trees for motif combination alignment, a logo comparison diagram for each clade in the tree, and a Pfam-domain pattern diagram are also available. We also developed a viewer named ‘SALAD on ARRAYs’ to view arbitrary microarray data sets of paralogous genes linked to the same dendrogram in a window. The SALAD database is a powerful tool for comparing protein sequences and can provide valuable hints for biological analysis.
BioNumbers (http://www.bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu) is a database of key numbers in molecular and cell biology—the quantitative properties of biological systems of interest to computational, systems and molecular cell biologists. Contents of the database range from cell sizes to metabolite concentrations, from reaction rates to generation times, from genome sizes to the number of mitochondria in a cell. While always of importance to biologists, having numbers in hand is becoming increasingly critical for experimenting, modeling, and analyzing biological systems. BioNumbers was motivated by an appreciation of how long it can take to find even the simplest number in the vast biological literature. All numbers are taken directly from a literature source and that reference is provided with the number. BioNumbers is designed to be highly searchable and queries can be performed by keywords or browsed by menus. BioNumbers is a collaborative community platform where registered users can add content and make comments on existing data. All new entries and commentary are curated to maintain high quality. Here we describe the database characteristics and implementation, demonstrate its use, and discuss future directions for its development.
Generation of syntactically correct and unambiguous names for proteins is a challenging, yet vital task for functional annotation processes. Proteins are often named based on homology to known proteins, many of which have problematic names. To address the need to generate high-quality protein names, and capture our significant experience correcting protein names manually, we have developed the Protein Naming Utility (PNU, http://www.jcvi.org/pn-utility). The PNU is a web-based database for storing and applying naming rules to identify and correct syntactically incorrect protein names, or to replace synonyms with their preferred name. The PNU allows users to generate and manage collections of naming rules, optionally building upon the growing body of rules generated at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Since communities often enforce disparate conventions for naming proteins, the PNU supports grouping rules into user-managed collections. Users can check their protein names against a selected PNU rule collection, generating both statistics and corrected names. The PNU can also be used to correct GenBank table files prior to submission to GenBank. Currently, the database features 3080 manual rules that have been entered by JCVI Bioinformatics Analysts as well as 7458 automatically imported names.
The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium (http://www.geneontology.org) (GOC) continues to develop, maintain and use a set of structured, controlled vocabularies for the annotation of genes, gene products and sequences. The GO ontologies are expanding both in content and in structure. Several new relationship types have been introduced and used, along with existing relationships, to create links between and within the GO domains. These improve the representation of biology, facilitate querying, and allow GO developers to systematically check for and correct inconsistencies within the GO. Gene product annotation using GO continues to increase both in the number of total annotations and in species coverage. GO tools, such as OBO-Edit, an ontology-editing tool, and AmiGO, the GOC ontology browser, have seen major improvements in functionality, speed and ease of use.
Since 2003, MicrobesOnline (http://www.microbesonline.org) has been providing a community resource for comparative and functional genome analysis. The portal includes over 1000 complete genomes of bacteria, archaea and fungi and thousands of expression microarrays from diverse organisms ranging from model organisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to environmental microbes such as Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Shewanella oneidensis. To assist in annotating genes and in reconstructing their evolutionary history, MicrobesOnline includes a comparative genome browser based on phylogenetic trees for every gene family as well as a species tree. To identify co-regulated genes, MicrobesOnline can search for genes based on their expression profile, and provides tools for identifying regulatory motifs and seeing if they are conserved. MicrobesOnline also includes fast phylogenetic profile searches, comparative views of metabolic pathways, operon predictions, a workbench for sequence analysis and integration with RegTransBase and other microbial genome resources. The next update of MicrobesOnline will contain significant new functionality, including comparative analysis of metagenomic sequence data. Programmatic access to the database, along with source code and documentation, is available at http://microbesonline.org/programmers.html.
EMAGE (http://www.emouseatlas.org/emage) is a freely available online database of in situ gene expression patterns in the developing mouse embryo. Gene expression domains from raw images are extracted and integrated spatially into a set of standard 3D virtual mouse embryos at different stages of development, which allows data interrogation by spatial methods. An anatomy ontology is also used to describe sites of expression, which allows data to be queried using text-based methods. Here, we describe recent enhancements to EMAGE including: the release of a completely re-designed website, which offers integration of many different search functions in HTML web pages, improved user feedback and the ability to find similar expression patterns at the click of a button; back-end refactoring from an object oriented to relational architecture, allowing associated SQL access; and the provision of further access by standard formatted URLs and a Java API. We have also increased data coverage by sourcing from a greater selection of journals and developed automated methods for spatial data annotation that are being applied to spatially incorporate the genome-wide (∼19 000 gene) ‘EURExpress’ dataset into EMAGE.
Three hormone receptors, the estrogen receptor (ER), the androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) play an important role in regulating the cellular differentiation tissue development of skin, bone, the brain and the endocrine system; therefore, there is a strong scientific need to identify and characterize hormone receptor transcriptional regulation. Given that the vast amount of regulatory data for hormone being produced by ChIP-based high-throughput experiments is widely scattered in disparate, poorly cross-indexed data stores, a flexible platform for organizing and relating these data would provide significant value. We created a data management system called the Hormone Receptor Target Binding Loci, HRTBLDb (http://motif.bmi.ohio-state.edu/hrtbldb), to address this problem. This database contains hormone receptor binding regions (binding loci) from in vivo ChIP-based high-throughput experiments as well as in silico, computationally predicted, binding motifs and cis-regulatory modules for the co-occurring transcription factor binding motifs, which are within a binding locus. It also contains individual binding sites whose regulatory action has been verified by in vitro experiments. The current version contains 44 673 binding elements with 114 hormone response elements which are verified by in vitro experiments; 75 binding motifs which occur with a hormone response element and whose co-regulatory action is verified by in vitro experiments; 18 472 binding loci from in vivo experiments; and 26 012 computationally predicted binding motifs.
Megx.net is a database and portal that provides integrated access to georeferenced marker genes, environment data and marine genome and metagenome projects for microbial ecological genomics. All data are stored in the Microbial Ecological Genomics DataBase (MegDB), which is subdivided to hold both sequence and habitat data and global environmental data layers. The extended system provides access to several hundreds of genomes and metagenomes from prokaryotes and phages, as well as over a million small and large subunit ribosomal RNA sequences. With the refined Genes Mapserver, all data can be interactively visualized on a world map and statistics describing environmental parameters can be calculated. Sequence entries have been curated to comply with the proposed minimal standards for genomes and metagenomes (MIGS/MIMS) of the Genomic Standards Consortium. Access to data is facilitated by Web Services. The updated megx.net portal offers microbial ecologists greatly enhanced database content, and new features and tools for data analysis, all of which are freely accessible from our webpage http://www.megx.net.
Protein Analysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) is a comprehensive software system for inferring the functions of genes based on their evolutionary relationships. Phylogenetic trees of gene families form the basis for PANTHER and these trees are annotated with ontology terms describing the evolution of gene function from ancestral to modern day genes. One of the main applications of PANTHER is in accurate prediction of the functions of uncharacterized genes, based on their evolutionary relationships to genes with functions known from experiment. The PANTHER website, freely available at http://www.pantherdb.org, also includes software tools for analyzing genomic data relative to known and inferred gene functions. Since 2007, there have been several new developments to PANTHER: (i) improved phylogenetic trees, explicitly representing speciation and gene duplication events, (ii) identification of gene orthologs, including least diverged orthologs (best one-to-one pairs), (iii) coverage of more genomes (48 genomes, up to 87% of genes in each genome; see http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/summaryStats.jsp), (iv) improved support for alternative database identifiers for genes, proteins and microarray probes and (v) adoption of the SBGN standard for display of biological pathways. In addition, PANTHER trees are being annotated with gene function as part of the Gene Ontology Reference Genome project, resulting in an increasing number of curated functional annotations.
3DNALandscapes, located at: http://3DNAscapes.rutgers.edu, is a new database for exploring the conformational features of DNA. In contrast to most structural databases, which archive the Cartesian coordinates and/or derived parameters and images for individual structures, 3DNALandscapes enables searches of conformational information across multiple structures. The database contains a wide variety of structural parameters and molecular images, computed with the 3DNA software package and known to be useful for characterizing and understanding the sequence-dependent spatial arrangements of the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, sugar-base side groups, base pairs, base-pair steps, groove structure, etc. The data comprise all DNA-containing structures—both free and bound to proteins, drugs and other ligands—currently available in the Protein Data Bank. The web interface allows the user to link, report, plot and analyze this information from numerous perspectives and thereby gain insight into DNA conformation, deformability and interactions in different sequence and structural contexts. The data accumulated from known, well-resolved DNA structures can serve as useful benchmarks for the analysis and simulation of new structures. The collective data can also help to understand how DNA deforms in response to proteins and other molecules and undergoes conformational rearrangements.
MicroRNAs are small, non-protein coding RNA molecules known to regulate the expression of genes by binding to the 3′UTR region of mRNAs. MicroRNAs are produced from longer transcripts which can code for more than one mature miRNAs. miRGen 2.0 is a database that aims to provide comprehensive information about the position of human and mouse microRNA coding transcripts and their regulation by transcription factors, including a unique compilation of both predicted and experimentally supported data. Expression profiles of microRNAs in several tissues and cell lines, single nucleotide polymorphism locations, microRNA target prediction on protein coding genes and mapping of miRNA targets of co-regulated miRNAs on biological pathways are also integrated into the database and user interface. The miRGen database will be continuously maintained and freely available at http://www.microrna.gr/mirgen/.
The MouseBook (http://www.mousebook.org) databases and web portal provide access to information about mutant mouse lines held as live or cryopreserved stocks at MRC Harwell. The MouseBook portal integrates curated information from the MRC Harwell stock resource, and other Harwell databases, with information from external data resources to provide value-added information above and beyond what is available through other routes such as International Mouse Stain Resource (IMSR). MouseBook can be searched either using an intuitive Google style free text search or using the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) ontology tree structure. Text searches can be on gene, allele, strain identifier (e.g. MGI ID) or phenotype term and are assisted by automatic recognition of term types and autocompletion of gene and allele names covered by the database. Results are returned in a tabbed format providing categorized results identified from each of the catalogs in MouseBook. Individual result lines from each catalog include information on gene, allele, chromosomal location and phenotype, and provide a simple click-through link to further information as well as ordering the strain. The infrastructure underlying MouseBook has been designed to be extensible, allowing additional data sources to be added and enabling other sites to make their data directly available through MouseBook.
The continuing threat of infectious disease and future pandemics, coupled to the continuous increase of drug-resistant pathogens, makes the discovery of new and better vaccines imperative. For effective vaccine development, antigen discovery and validation is a prerequisite. The compilation of information concerning pathogens, virulence factors and antigenic epitopes has resulted in many useful databases. However, most such immunological databases focus almost exclusively on antigens where epitopes are known and ignore those for which epitope information was unavailable. We have compiled more than 500 antigens into the AntigenDB database, making use of the literature and other immunological resources. These antigens come from 44 important pathogenic species. In AntigenDB, a database entry contains information regarding the sequence, structure, origin, etc. of an antigen with additional information such as B and T-cell epitopes, MHC binding, function, gene-expression and post translational modifications, where available. AntigenDB also provides links to major internal and external databases. We shall update AntigenDB on a rolling basis, regularly adding antigens from other organisms and extra data analysis tools. AntigenDB is available freely at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/antigendb and its mirror site http://www.bic.uams.edu/raghava/antigendb.
Most of the proteins in a cell assemble into complexes to carry out their function. In this work, we have created a new database (named ComSin) of protein structures in bound (complex) and unbound (single) states to provide a researcher with exhaustive information on structures of the same or homologous proteins in bound and unbound states. From the complete Protein Data Bank (PDB), we selected 24 910 pairs of protein structures in bound and unbound states, and identified regions of intrinsic disorder. For 2448 pairs, the proteins in bound and unbound states are identical, while 7129 pairs have sequence identity 90% or larger. The developed server enables one to search for proteins in bound and unbound states with several options including sequence similarity between the corresponding proteins in bound and unbound states, and validation of interaction interfaces of protein complexes. Besides that, through our web server, one can obtain necessary information for studying disorder-to-order and order-to-disorder transitions upon complex formation, and analyze structural differences between proteins in bound and unbound states. The database is available at http://antares.protres.ru/comsin/.
In an effort to capture meaningful biological, chemical and mechanistic information about clinically relevant, commonly encountered or important toxins, we have developed the Toxin and Toxin-Target Database (T3DB). The T3DB is a unique bioinformatics resource that compiles comprehensive information about common or ubiquitous toxins and their toxin-targets into a single electronic repository. The database currently contains over 2900 small molecule and peptide toxins, 1300 toxin-targets and more than 33 000 toxin-target associations. Each T3DB record (ToxCard) contains over 80 data fields providing detailed information on chemical properties and descriptors, toxicity values, protein and gene sequences (for both targets and toxins), molecular and cellular interaction data, toxicological data, mechanistic information and references. This information has been manually extracted and manually verified from numerous sources, including other electronic databases, government documents, textbooks and scientific journals. A key focus of the T3DB is on providing ‘depth’ over ‘breadth’ with detailed descriptions, mechanisms of action, and information on toxins and toxin-targets. T3DB is fully searchable and supports extensive text, sequence, chemical structure and relational query searches, similar to those found in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and DrugBank. Potential applications of the T3DB include clinical metabolomics, toxin target prediction, toxicity prediction and toxicology education. The T3DB is available online at http://www.t3db.org.
Ensembl Genomes (http://www.ensemblgenomes.org) is a new portal offering integrated access to genome-scale data from non-vertebrate species of scientific interest, developed using the Ensembl genome annotation and visualisation platform. Ensembl Genomes consists of five sub-portals (for bacteria, protists, fungi, plants and invertebrate metazoa) designed to complement the availability of vertebrate genomes in Ensembl. Many of the databases supporting the portal have been built in close collaboration with the scientific community, which we consider as essential for maintaining the accuracy and usefulness of the resource. A common set of user interfaces (which include a graphical genome browser, FTP, BLAST search, a query optimised data warehouse, programmatic access, and a Perl API) is provided for all domains. Data types incorporated include annotation of (protein and non-protein coding) genes, cross references to external resources, and high throughput experimental data (e.g. data from large scale studies of gene expression and polymorphism visualised in their genomic context). Additionally, extensive comparative analysis has been performed, both within defined clades and across the wider taxonomy, and sequence alignments and gene trees resulting from this can be accessed through the site.
Advances in high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology have reshaped the transcriptomic research landscape. However, exploration of these massive data remains a daunting challenge. In this study, we describe a novel database, deepBase, which we have developed to facilitate the comprehensive annotation and discovery of small RNAs from transcriptomic data. The current release of deepBase contains deep sequencing data from 185 small RNA libraries from diverse tissues and cell lines of seven organisms: human, mouse, chicken, Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenhorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana. By analyzing ∼14.6 million unique reads that perfectly mapped to more than 284 million genomic loci, we annotated and identified ∼380 000 unique ncRNA-associated small RNAs (nasRNAs), ∼1.5 million unique promoter-associated small RNAs (pasRNAs), ∼4.0 million unique exon-associated small RNAs (easRNAs) and ∼6 million unique repeat-associated small RNAs (rasRNAs). Furthermore, 2038 miRNA and 1889 snoRNA candidates were predicted by miRDeep and snoSeeker. All of the mapped reads can be grouped into about 1.2 million RNA clusters. For the purpose of comparative analysis, deepBase provides an integrative, interactive and versatile display. A convenient search option, related publications and other useful information are also provided for further investigation. deepBase is available at: http://deepbase.sysu.edu.cn/.
TriTrypDB (http://tritrypdb.org) is an integrated database providing access to genome-scale datasets for kinetoplastid parasites, and supporting a variety of complex queries driven by research and development needs. TriTrypDB is a collaborative project, utilizing the GUS/WDK computational infrastructure developed by the Eukaryotic Pathogen Bioinformatics Resource Center (EuPathDB.org) to integrate genome annotation and analyses from GeneDB and elsewhere with a wide variety of functional genomics datasets made available by members of the global research community, often pre-publication. Currently, TriTrypDB integrates datasets from Leishmania braziliensis, L. infantum, L. major, L. tarentolae, Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi. Users may examine individual genes or chromosomal spans in their genomic context, including syntenic alignments with other kinetoplastid organisms. Data within TriTrypDB can be interrogated utilizing a sophisticated search strategy system that enables a user to construct complex queries combining multiple data types. All search strategies are stored, allowing future access and integrated searches. ‘User Comments’ may be added to any gene page, enhancing available annotation; such comments become immediately searchable via the text search, and are forwarded to curators for incorporation into the reference annotation when appropriate.
CORUM is a database that provides a manually curated repository of experimentally characterized protein complexes from mammalian organisms, mainly human (64%), mouse (16%) and rat (12%). Protein complexes are key molecular entities that integrate multiple gene products to perform cellular functions. The new CORUM 2.0 release encompasses 2837 protein complexes offering the largest and most comprehensive publicly available dataset of mammalian protein complexes. The CORUM dataset is built from 3198 different genes, representing ∼16% of the protein coding genes in humans. Each protein complex is described by a protein complex name, subunit composition, function as well as the literature reference that characterizes the respective protein complex. Recent developments include mapping of functional annotation to Gene Ontology terms as well as cross-references to Entrez Gene identifiers. In addition, a ‘Phylogenetic Conservation’ analysis tool was implemented that analyses the potential occurrence of orthologous protein complex subunits in mammals and other selected groups of organisms. This allows one to predict the occurrence of protein complexes in different phylogenetic groups. CORUM is freely accessible at (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/genre/proj/corum/index.html).
3D-footprint is a living database, updated and curated on a weekly basis, which provides estimates of binding specificity for all protein–DNA complexes available at the Protein Data Bank. The web interface allows the user to: (i) browse DNA-binding proteins by keyword; (ii) find proteins that recognize a similar DNA motif and (iii) BLAST similar DNA-binding proteins, highlighting interface residues in the resulting alignments. Each complex in the database is dissected to draw interface graphs and footprint logos, and two complementary algorithms are employed to characterize binding specificity. Moreover, oligonucleotide sequences extracted from literature abstracts are reported in order to show the range of variant sites bound by each protein and other related proteins. Benchmark experiments, including comparisons with expert-curated databases RegulonDB and TRANSFAC, support the quality of structure-based estimates of specificity. The relevant content of the database is available for download as flat files and it is also possible to use the 3D-footprint pipeline to analyze protein coordinates input by the user. 3D-footprint is available at http://floresta.eead.csic.es/3dfootprint with demo buttons and a comprehensive tutorial that illustrates the main uses of this resource.
The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) has collected and released 1 701 110 entries/1 116 138 614 bases between July 2008 and June 2009. A few highlighted data releases from DDBJ were the complete genome sequence of an endosymbiont within protist cells in the termite gut and Cap Analysis Gene Expression tags for human and mouse deposited from the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian cDNA consortium. In this period, we started a novel user announcement service using Really Simple Syndication (RSS) to deliver a list of data released from DDBJ on a daily basis. Comprehensive visualization of a DDBJ release data was attempted by using a word cloud program. Moreover, a new archive for sequencing data from next-generation sequencers, the ‘DDBJ Read Archive’ (DRA), was launched. Concurrently, for read data registered in DRA, a semi-automatic annotation tool called the ‘DDBJ Read Annotation Pipeline’ was released as a preliminary step. The pipeline consists of two parts: basic analysis for reference genome mapping and de novo assembly and high-level analysis of structural and functional annotations. These new services will aid users' research and provide easier access to DDBJ databases.
The 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs (UTRs) play crucial roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression through the modulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic mRNA transport, translation efficiency, subcellular localization and message stability. UTRdb is a curated database of 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs, derived from several sources of primary data. Experimentally validated functional motifs are annotated and also collated as the UTRsite database where more specific information on the functional motifs and cross-links to interacting regulatory protein are provided. In the current update, the UTR entries have been organized in a gene-centric structure to better visualize and retrieve 5′ and 3′UTR variants generated by alternative initiation and termination of transcription and alternative splicing. Experimentally validated miRNA targets and conserved sequence elements are also annotated. The integration of UTRdb with genomic data has allowed the implementation of an efficient annotation system and a powerful retrieval resource for the selection and extraction of specific UTR subsets. All internet resources implemented for retrieval and functional analysis of 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs are accessible at http://utrdb.ba.itb.cnr.it/.
Membrane proteins are important for many processes in the cell and used as main drug targets. The increasing number of high-resolution structures available makes for the first time a characterization of local structural and functional motifs in α-helical transmembrane proteins possible. MeMotif (http://projects.biotec.tu-dresden.de/memotif) is a database and wiki which collects more than 2000 known and novel computationally predicted linear motifs in α-helical transmembrane proteins. Motifs are fully described in terms of several structural and functional features and editable. Motifs contained in MeMotif can be used in different biological applications, from the identification of biochemically important functional residues which are candidates for mutagenesis experiments to the improvement of tools for transmembrane protein modeling.
The PhosPhAt database of Arabidopsis phosphorylation sites was initially launched in August 2007. Since then, along with 10-fold increase in database entries, functionality of PhosPhAt (phosphat.mpimp-golm.mpg.de) has been considerably upgraded and re-designed. PhosPhAt is now more of a web application with the inclusion of advanced search functions allowing combinatorial searches by Boolean terms. The results output now includes interactive visualization of annotated fragmentation spectra and the ability to export spectra and peptide sequences as text files for use in other applications. We have also implemented dynamic links to other web resources thus augmenting PhosPhAt-specific information with external protein-related data. For experimental phosphorylation sites with information about dynamic behavior in response to external stimuli, we display simple time-resolved diagrams. We have included predictions for pT and pY sites and updated pS predictions. Access to prediction algorithm now allows ‘on-the-fly’ prediction of phosphorylation of any user-uploaded protein sequence. Protein Pfam domain structures are now mapped onto the protein sequence display next to experimental and predicted phosphorylation sites. Finally, we have implemented functional annotation of proteins using MAPMAN ontology. These new developments make the PhosPhAt resource a useful and powerful tool for the scientific community as a whole beyond the plant sciences.
The primary objective of most gene expression studies is the identification of one or more gene signatures; lists of genes whose transcriptional levels are uniquely associated with a specific biological phenotype. Whilst thousands of experimentally derived gene signatures are published, their potential value to the community is limited by their computational inaccessibility. Gene signatures are embedded in published article figures, tables or in Supplementary Data, and are frequently presented using non-standard gene or probeset nomenclature. We present GeneSigDB (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/genesigdb) a manually curated database of gene expression signatures. GeneSigDB release 1.0 focuses on cancer and stem cells gene signatures and was constructed from more than 850 publications from which we manually transcribed 575 gene signatures. Most gene signatures (n = 560) were successfully mapped to the genome to extract standardized lists of EnsEMBL gene identifiers. GeneSigDB provides the original gene signature, the standardized gene list and a fully traceable gene mapping history for each gene from the original transcribed data table through to the standardized list of genes. The GeneSigDB web portal is easy to search, allows users to compare their own gene list to those in the database, and download gene signatures in most common gene identifier formats.
Quantifying the functional similarity of genes and their products based on Gene Ontology annotation is an important tool for diverse applications like the analysis of gene expression data, the prediction and validation of protein functions and interactions, and the prioritization of disease genes. The Functional Similarity Matrix (FunSimMat, http://www.funsimmat.de) is a comprehensive database providing various precomputed functional similarity values for proteins in UniProtKB and for protein families in Pfam and SMART. With this update, we significantly increase the coverage of FunSimMat by adding data from the Gene Ontology Annotation project as well as new functional similarity measures. The applicability of the database is greatly extended by the implementation of a new Gene Ontology-based method for disease gene prioritization. Two new visualization tools allow an interactive analysis of the functional relationships between proteins or protein families. This is enhanced further by the introduction of an automatically derived hierarchy of annotation classes. Additional changes include a revised user front-end and a new RESTlike interface for improving the user-friendliness and online accessibility of FunSimMat.
The National BioResource Project (NBRP) is a Japanese project that aims to establish a system for collecting, preserving and providing bioresources for use as experimental materials for life science research. It is promoted by 27 core resource facilities, each concerned with a particular group of organisms, and by one information center. The NBRP database is a product of this project. Thirty databases and an integrated database-retrieval system (BioResource World: BRW) have been created and made available through the NBRP home page (http://www.nbrp.jp). The 30 independent databases have individual features which directly reflect the data maintained by each resource facility. The BRW is designed for users who need to search across several resources without moving from one database to another. BRW provides access to a collection of 4.5-million records on bioresources including wild species, inbred lines, mutants, genetically engineered lines, DNA clones and so on. BRW supports summary browsing, keyword searching, and searching by DNA sequences or gene ontology. The results of searches provide links to online requests for distribution of research materials. A circulation system allows users to submit details of papers published on research conducted using NBRP resources.
With growing amount of experimental data, the number of known protein structures also increases continuously. Classification of protein structures helps to understand relationships between protein structure and function. The main classification methods based on secondary structures are SCOP, CATH and TOPS, which all classify under different aspects, and therefore can lead to different results. We developed a mathematically unique representation of protein structure topologies at a higher abstraction level providing new aspects of classification and enabling for a fast search through the data. Protein Topology Graph Library (PTGL; http://ptgl.zib.de) aims at providing a database on protein secondary structure topologies, including search facilities, the visualization as intuitive topology diagrams as well as in the 3D structure, and additional information. Secondary structure-based protein topologies are represented uniquely as undirected labeled graphs in four different ways allowing for exploration under different aspects. The linear notations, and the 2D and 3D diagrams of each notation facilitate a deeper understanding of protein topologies. Several search functions for topologies and sub-topologies, BLAST search possibility, and links to SCOP, CATH and PDBsum support individual and large-scale investigation of protein structures. Currently, PTGL comprises topologies of 54 859 protein structures. Main structural patterns for common structural motifs like TIM-barrel or Jelly Roll are pre-implemented, and can easily be searched.
The Nearest Neighbor Database (NNDB, http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/NNDB) is a web-based resource for disseminating parameter sets for predicting nucleic acid secondary structure stabilities. For each set of parameters, the database includes the set of rules with descriptive text, sequence-dependent parameters in plain text and html, literature references to experiments and usage tutorials. The initial release covers parameters for predicting RNA folding free energy and enthalpy changes.
The ACLAME database is dedicated to the collection, analysis and classification of sequenced mobile genetic elements (MGEs, in particular phages and plasmids). In addition to providing information on the MGEs content, classifications are available at various levels of organization. At the gene/protein level, families group similar sequences that are expected to share the same function. Families of four or more proteins are manually assigned with a functional annotation using the GeneOntology and the locally developed ontology MeGO dedicated to MGEs. At the genome level, evolutionary cohesive modules group sets of protein families shared among MGEs. At the population level, networks display the reticulate evolutionary relationships among MGEs. To increase the coverage of the phage sequence space, ACLAME version 0.4 incorporates 760 high-quality predicted prophages selected from the Prophinder database. Most of the data can be downloaded from the freely accessible ACLAME web site (http://aclame.ulb.ac.be). The BLAST interface for querying the database has been extended and numerous tools for in-depth analysis of the results have been added.
Next generation sequencing platforms are producing biological sequencing data in unprecedented amounts. The partners of the International Nucleotide Sequencing Database Collaboration, which includes the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), have established the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) to provide the scientific community with an archival destination for next generation data sets. The SRA is now accessible at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra from NCBI, at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena from EBI and at http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/sub/trace_sra-e.html from DDBJ. Users of these resources can obtain data sets deposited in any of the three SRA instances. Links and submission instructions are provided.
Cancer-related investigations have long been in the limelight of biomedical research. Years of effort from scientists and doctors worldwide have generated large amounts of data at the genome, transcriptome, proteome and even metabolome level, and DNA and RNA cancer signature databases have been established. Here we present a database of differentially expressed proteins in human cancers (dbDEPC), with the goal of collecting curated cancer proteomics data, providing a resource for information on protein-level expression changes, and exploring protein profile differences among different cancers. dbDEPC currently contains 1803 proteins differentially expressed in 15 cancers, curated from 65 mass spectrometry (MS) experiments in peer-reviewed publications. In addition to MS experiments, low-throughput experiment data from the same literatures and cancer-associated genes from external databases were also integrated to provide some validation information. Furthermore, dbDEPC associates differential proteins with important structural variations in the human genome, such as copy number variations or single nucleotide polymorphisms, which might be helpful for explaining changes in protein expression at the DNA level. Data in dbDEPC can be queried by protein identifier, description or sequence; the retrieved protein entry provides the differential expression pattern seen in cancers, along with detailed annotations. dbDEPC is expected to be a reference database for cancer signatures at the protein level. This database is provided at http://dbdepc.biosino.org/index/.
The Proteomics Identifications database (PRIDE, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) at the European Bioinformatics Institute has become one of the main repositories of mass spectrometry-derived proteomics data. For the last 2 years, PRIDE data holdings have grown substantially, comprising 60 different species, more than 2.5 million protein identifications, 11.5 million peptides and over 50 million spectra by September 2009. We here describe several new and improved features in PRIDE, including the revised submission process, which now includes direct submission of fragment ion annotations. Correspondingly, it is now possible to visualize spectrum fragmentation annotations on tandem mass spectra, a key feature for compliance with journal data submission requirements. We also describe recent developments in the PRIDE BioMart interface, which now allows integrative queries that can join PRIDE data to a growing number of biological resources such as Reactome, Ensembl, InterPro and UniProt. This ability to perform extremely powerful across-domain queries will certainly be a cornerstone of future bioinformatics analyses. Finally, we highlight the importance of data sharing in the proteomics field, and the corresponding integration of PRIDE with other databases in the ProteomExchange consortium.
GenBank® is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for more than 300 000 organisms named at the genus level or lower, obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects, including whole genome shotgun (WGS) and environmental sampling projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs, and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank staff upon receipt. Daily data exchange with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Nucleotide Sequence Database in Europe and the DNA Data Bank of Japan ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through the NCBI Entrez retrieval system, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bi-monthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. To access GenBank and its related retrieval and analysis services, begin at the NCBI homepage: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org) integrates genomic information for a comprehensive set of chordate genomes with a particular focus on resources for human, mouse, rat, zebrafish and other high-value sequenced genomes. We provide complete gene annotations for all supported species in addition to specific resources that target genome variation, function and evolution. Ensembl data is accessible in a variety of formats including via our genome browser, API and BioMart. This year marks the tenth anniversary of Ensembl and in that time the project has grown with advances in genome technology. As of release 56 (September 2009), Ensembl supports 51 species including marmoset, pig, zebra finch, lizard, gorilla and wallaby, which were added in the past year. Major additions and improvements to Ensembl since our previous report include the incorporation of the human GRCh37 assembly, enhanced visualisation and data-mining options for the Ensembl regulatory features and continued development of our software infrastructure.
The microbial genome database (MBGD) for comparative analysis is a platform for microbial comparative genomics based on automated ortholog group identification. A prominent feature of MBGD is that it allows users to create ortholog groups using a specified subgroup of organisms. The database is constantly updated and now contains almost 1000 genomes. To utilize the MBGD database as a comprehensive resource for investigating microbial genome diversity, we have developed the following advanced functionalities: (i) enhanced assignment of functional annotation, including external database links to each orthologous group, (ii) interface for choosing a set of genomes to compare based on phenotypic properties, (iii) the addition of more eukaryotic microbial genomes (fungi and protists) and some higher eukaryotes as references and (iv) enhancement of the MyMBGD mode, which allows users to add their own genomes to MBGD and now accepts raw genomic sequences without any annotation (in such a case, it runs a gene-finding procedure before identifying the orthologs). Some analysis functions, such as the function to find orthologs with similar phylogenetic patterns, have also been improved. MBGD is accessible at http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/.
Histone modifications play important roles in chromatin remodeling, gene transcriptional regulation, stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Alterations in histone modifications may be linked to human diseases especially cancer. Histone modifications including methylation, acetylation and ubiquitylation probed by ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip and qChIP have become widely available. Mining and integration of histone modification data can be beneficial to novel biological discoveries. There has been no comprehensive data repository that is exclusive for human histone modifications. Therefore, we developed a relatively comprehensive database for human histone modifications. Human Histone Modification Database (HHMD, http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/hhmd) focuses on the storage and integration of histone modification datasets that were obtained from laboratory experiments. The latest release of HHMD incorporates 43 location-specific histone modifications in human. To facilitate data extraction, flexible search options are built in HHMD. It can be searched by histone modification, gene ID, functional categories, chromosome location and cancer name. HHMD also includes a user-friendly visualization tool named HisModView, by which genome-wide histone modification map can be shown. HisModView facilitates the acquisition and visualization of histone modifications. The database also has manually curated information of histone modification dysregulation in nine human cancers.
Over the last 2 years the Gene3D resource has been significantly improved, and is now more accurate and with a much richer interactive display via the Gene3D website (http://gene3d.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/). Gene3D provides accurate structural domain family assignments for over 1100 genomes and nearly 10 000 000 proteins. A hidden Markov model library, constructed from the manually curated CATH structural domain hierarchy, is used to search UniProt, RefSeq and Ensembl protein sequences. The resulting matches are refined into simple multi-domain architectures using a recently developed in-house algorithm, DomainFinder 3 (available at: ftp://ftp.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/pub/gene3d_data/DomainFinder3/). The domain assignments are integrated with multiple external protein function descriptions (e.g. Gene Ontology and KEGG), structural annotations (e.g. coiled coils, disordered regions and sequence polymorphisms) and family resources (e.g. Pfam and eggNog) and displayed on the Gene3D website. The website allows users to view descriptions for both single proteins and genes and large protein sets, such as superfamilies or genomes. Subsets can then be selected for detailed investigation or associated functions and interactions can be used to expand explorations to new proteins. Gene3D also provides a set of services, including an interactive genome coverage graph visualizer, DAS annotation resources, sequence search facilities and SOAP services.
WormBase (http://www.wormbase.org) is a central data repository for nematode biology. Initially created as a service to the Caenorhabditis elegans research field, WormBase has evolved into a powerful research tool in its own right. In the past 2 years, we expanded WormBase to include the complete genomic sequence, gene predictions and orthology assignments from a range of related nematodes. This comparative data enrich the C. elegans data with improved gene predictions and a better understanding of gene function. In turn, they bring the wealth of experimental knowledge of C. elegans to other systems of medical and agricultural importance. Here, we describe new species and data types now available at WormBase. In addition, we detail enhancements to our curatorial pipeline and website infrastructure to accommodate new genomes and an extensive user base.
PDBselect (http://bioinfo.tg.fh-giessen.de/pdbselect/) is a list of representative protein chains with low mutual sequence identity selected from the protein data bank (PDB) to enable unbiased statistics. The list increased from 155 chains in 1992 to more than 4500 chains in 2009. PDBfilter-select is an online service to generate user-defined selections.
The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB, www.iedb.org) provides a catalog of experimentally characterized B and T cell epitopes, as well as data on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) binding and MHC ligand elution experiments. The database represents the molecular structures recognized by adaptive immune receptors and the experimental contexts in which these molecules were determined to be immune epitopes. Epitopes recognized in humans, nonhuman primates, rodents, pigs, cats and all other tested species are included. Both positive and negative experimental results are captured. Over the course of 4 years, the data from 180 978 experiments were curated manually from the literature, which covers ∼99% of all publicly available information on peptide epitopes mapped in infectious agents (excluding HIV) and 93% of those mapped in allergens. In addition, data that would otherwise be unavailable to the public from 129 186 experiments were submitted directly by investigators. The curation of epitopes related to autoimmunity is expected to be completed by the end of 2010. The database can be queried by epitope structure, source organism, MHC restriction, assay type or host organism, among other criteria. The database structure, as well as its querying, browsing and reporting interfaces, was completely redesigned for the IEDB 2.0 release, which became publicly available in early 2009.
The SilkDB is an open-access database for genome biology of the silkworm (Bombyx mori). Since the draft sequence was completed and the SilkDB was first released 5 years ago, we have collaborated with other groups to make much remarkable progress on silkworm genome research, such as the completion of a new high-quality assembly of the silkworm genome sequence as well as the construction of a genome-wide microarray to survey gene expression profiles. To accommodate these new genomic data and house more comprehensive genomic information, we have reconstructed SilkDB database with new web interfaces. In the new version (v2.0) of SilkDB, we updated the genomic data, including genome assembly, gene annotation, chromosomal mapping, orthologous relationship and experiment data, such as microarray expression data, Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and corresponding references. Several new tools, including SilkMap, Silkworm Chromosome Browser (SCB) and BmArray, are developed to access silkworm genomic data conveniently. SilkDB is publicly available at the new URL of http://www.silkdb.org.
Structural information on interacting proteins is important for understanding life processes at the molecular level. Genome-wide docking database is an integrated resource for structural studies of protein–protein interactions on the genome scale, which combines the available experimental data with models obtained by docking techniques. Current database version (August 2009) contains 25 559 experimental and modeled 3D structures for 771 organisms spanned over the entire universe of life from viruses to humans. Data are organized in a relational database with user-friendly search interface allowing exploration of the database content by a number of parameters. Search results can be interactively previewed and downloaded as PDB-formatted files, along with the information relevant to the specified interactions. The resource is freely available at http://gwidd.bioinformatics.ku.edu.
The human lung cancer database (HLungDB) is a database with the integration of the lung cancer-related genes, proteins and miRNAs together with the corresponding clinical information. The main purpose of this platform is to establish a network of lung cancer-related molecules and to facilitate the mechanistic study of lung carcinogenesis. The entries describing the relationships between molecules and human lung cancer in the current release were extracted manually from literatures. Currently, we have collected 2585 genes and 212 miRNA with the experimental evidences involved in the different stages of lung carcinogenesis through text mining. Furthermore, we have incorporated the results from analysis of transcription factor-binding motifs, the promoters and the SNP sites for each gene. Since epigenetic alterations also play an important role in lung carcinogenesis, genes with epigenetic regulation were also included. We hope HLungDB will enrich our knowledge about lung cancer biology and eventually lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. HLungDB can be freely accessed at http://www.megabionet.org/bio/hlung.
PrimerBank (http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/) is a public resource for the retrieval of human and mouse primer pairs for gene expression analysis by PCR and Quantitative PCR (QPCR). A total of 306 800 primers covering most known human and mouse genes can be accessed from the PrimerBank database, together with information on these primers such as Tm, location on the transcript and amplicon size. For each gene, at least one primer pair has been designed and in many cases alternative primer pairs exist. Primers have been designed to work under the same PCR conditions, thus facilitating high-throughput QPCR. There are several ways to search for primers for the gene(s) of interest, such as by: GenBank accession number, NCBI protein accession number, NCBI gene ID, PrimerBank ID, NCBI gene symbol or gene description (keyword). In all, 26 855 primer pairs covering most known mouse genes have been experimentally validated by QPCR, agarose gel analysis, sequencing and BLAST, and all validation data can be freely accessed from the PrimerBank web site.
The Comprehensive Microbial Resource or CMR (http://cmr.jcvi.org) provides a web-based central resource for the display, search and analysis of the sequence and annotation for complete and publicly available bacterial and archaeal genomes. In addition to displaying the original annotation from GenBank, the CMR makes available secondary automated structural and functional annotation across all genomes to provide consistent data types necessary for effective mining of genomic data. Precomputed homology searches are stored to allow meaningful genome comparisons. The CMR supplies users with over 50 different tools to utilize the sequence and annotation data across one or more of the 571 currently available genomes. At the gene level users can view the gene annotation and underlying evidence. Genome level information includes whole genome graphical displays, biochemical pathway maps and genome summary data. Comparative tools display analysis between genomes with homology and genome alignment tools, and searches across the accessions, annotation, and evidence assigned to all genes/genomes are available. The data and tools on the CMR aid genomic research and analysis, and the CMR is included in over 200 scientific publications. The code underlying the CMR website and the CMR database are freely available for download with no license restrictions.
Cell division involves a complex series of events orchestrated by thousands of molecules. To study this process, researchers have employed mRNA expression profiling of synchronously growing cell cultures progressing through the cell cycle. These experiments, which have been carried out in several organisms, are not easy to access, combine and evaluate. Complicating factors include variation in interdivision time between experiments and differences in relative duration of each cell-cycle phase across organisms. To address these problems, we created Cyclebase, an online resource of cell-cycle-related experiments. This database provides an easy-to-use web interface that facilitates visualization and download of genome-wide cell-cycle data and analysis results. Data from different experiments are normalized to a common timescale and are complimented with key cell-cycle information and derived analysis results. In Cyclebase version 2.0, we have updated the entire database to reflect changes to genome annotations, included information on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) substrates, predicted degradation signals and loss-of-function phenotypes from genome-wide screens. The web interface has been improved and provides a single, gene-centric graph summarizing the available cell-cycle experiments. Finally, key information and links to orthologous and paralogous genes are now included to further facilitate comparison of cell-cycle regulation across species. Cyclebase version 2.0 is available at http://www.cyclebase.org.
Xenbase (www.xenbase.org), the model organism database for Xenopus laevis and X. (Silurana) tropicalis, is the principal centralized resource of genomic, development data and community information for Xenopus research. Recent improvements include the addition of the literature and interaction tabs to gene catalog pages. New content has been added including a section on gene expression patterns that incorporates image data from the literature, large scale screens and community submissions. Gene expression data are integrated into the gene catalog via an expression tab and is also searchable by multiple criteria using an expression search interface. The gene catalog has grown to contain over 15 000 genes. Collaboration with the European Xenopus Research Center (EXRC) has resulted in a stock center section with data on frog lines supplied by the EXRC. Numerous improvements have also been made to search and navigation. Xenbase is also the source of the Xenopus Anatomical Ontology and the clearinghouse for Xenopus gene nomenclature.
The backbone bond lengths, bond angles, and planarity of a protein are influenced by the backbone conformation (ϕ,Ψ), but no tool exists to explore these relationships, leaving this area as a reservoir of untapped information about protein structure and function. The Protein Geometry Database (PGD) enables biologists to easily and flexibly query information about the conformation alone, the backbone geometry alone, and the relationships between them. The capabilities the PGD provides are valuable for assessing the uniqueness of observed conformational or geometric features in protein structure as well as discovering novel features and principles of protein structure. The PGD server is available at http://pgd.science.oregonstate.edu/ and the data and code underlying it are freely available to use and extend.
Standard Affymetrix technology evaluates gene expression by measuring the intensity of mRNA hybridization with a panel of the 25-mer oligonucleotide probes, and summarizing the probe signal intensities by a robust average method. However, in many cases, signal intensity of the probe does not correlate with gene expression. This could be due to the hybridization of the probe to a transcript of another gene, mapping of the probe to an intron, alternative splicing, single nucleotide polymorphisms and other reasons. We have developed a database, PLANdbAffy (available at http://affymetrix2.bioinf.fbb.msu.ru), that contains the results of the alignment of probe sequences from five Affymetrix expression microarrays to the human genome. We have determined the probes matching the transcript-coding regions in the correct orientation. For each such probe alignment region, we determined the mRNA and EST sequences that contain the probe sequence. In the textual part of the database interface we summarize the data on the sequences that cover the probe alignment region and SNPs that are located inside it. The graphical part of our database interface is implemented as custom tracks to the UCSC genome browser that allows one to utilize all the data that are offered by UCSC browser.
The wide uptake of next-generation sequencing and other ultra-high throughput technologies by life scientists with a diverse range of interests, spanning fundamental biological research, medicine, agriculture and environmental science, has led to unprecedented growth in the amount of data generated. It has also put the need for unrestricted access to biological data at the centre of biology. The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) is unique in Europe and is one of only two organisations worldwide providing access to a comprehensive, integrated set of these collections. Here, we describe how the EMBL-EBI's biomolecular databases are evolving to cope with increasing levels of submission, a growing and diversifying user base, and the demand for new types of data. All of the resources described here can be accessed from the EMBL-EBI website: http://www.ebi.ac.uk
The RegPrecise database (http://regprecise.lbl.gov) was developed for capturing, visualization and analysis of predicted transcription factor regulons in prokaryotes that were reconstructed and manually curated by utilizing the comparative genomic approach. A significant number of high-quality inferences of transcriptional regulatory interactions have been already accumulated for diverse taxonomic groups of bacteria. The reconstructed regulons include transcription factors, their cognate DNA motifs and regulated genes/operons linked to the candidate transcription factor binding sites. The RegPrecise allows for browsing the regulon collections for: (i) conservation of DNA binding sites and regulated genes for a particular regulon across diverse taxonomic lineages; (ii) sets of regulons for a family of transcription factors; (iii) repertoire of regulons in a particular taxonomic group of species; (iv) regulons associated with a metabolic pathway or a biological process in various genomes. The initial release of the database includes ∼11 500 candidate binding sites for ∼400 orthologous groups of transcription factors from over 350 prokaryotic genomes. Majority of these data are represented by genome-wide regulon reconstructions in Shewanella and Streptococcus genera and a large-scale prediction of regulons for the LacI family of transcription factors. Another section in the database represents the results of accurate regulon propagation to the closely related genomes.
The prediction of protein function as well as the reconstruction of evolutionary genesis employing sequence comparison at large is still the most powerful tool in sequence analysis. Due to the exponential growth of the number of known protein sequences and the subsequent quadratic growth of the similarity matrix, the computation of the Similarity Matrix of Proteins (SIMAP) becomes a computational intensive task. The SIMAP database provides a comprehensive and up-to-date pre-calculation of the protein sequence similarity matrix, sequence-based features and sequence clusters. As of September 2009, SIMAP covers 48 million proteins and more than 23 million non-redundant sequences. Novel features of SIMAP include the expansion of the sequence space by including databases such as ENSEMBL as well as the integration of metagenomes based on their consistent processing and annotation. Furthermore, protein function predictions by Blast2GO are pre-calculated for all sequences in SIMAP and the data access and query functions have been improved. SIMAP assists biologists to query the up-to-date sequence space systematically and facilitates large-scale downstream projects in computational biology. Access to SIMAP is freely provided through the web portal for individuals (http://mips.gsf.de/simap/) and for programmatic access through DAS (http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/das/) and Web-Service (http://mips.gsf.de/webservices/services/SimapService2.0?wsdl).
The Candida Genome Database (CGD, http://www.candidagenome.org/) provides online access to genomic sequence data and manually curated functional information about genes and proteins of the human pathogen Candida albicans. Herein, we describe two recently added features, Candida Biochemical Pathways and the Textpresso full-text literature search tool. The Biochemical Pathways tool provides visualization of metabolic pathways and analysis tools that facilitate interpretation of experimental data, including results of large-scale experiments, in the context of Candida metabolism. Textpresso for Candida allows searching through the full-text of Candida-specific literature, including clinical and epidemiological studies.
The PubChem BioAssay database (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a public repository for biological activities of small molecules and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) hosted by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). It archives experimental descriptions of assays and biological test results and makes the information freely accessible to the public. A PubChem BioAssay data entry includes an assay description, a summary and detailed test results. Each assay record is linked to the molecular target, whenever possible, and is cross-referenced to other National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database records. ‘Related BioAssays’ are identified by examining the assay target relationship and activity profile of commonly tested compounds. A key goal of PubChem BioAssay is to make the biological activity information easily accessible through the NCBI information retrieval system-Entrez, and various web-based PubChem services. An integrated suite of data analysis tools are available to optimize the utility of the chemical structure and biological activity information within PubChem, enabling researchers to aggregate, compare and analyze biological test results contributed by multiple organizations. In this work, we describe the PubChem BioAssay database, including data model, bioassay deposition and utilities that PubChem provides for searching, downloading and analyzing the biological activity information contained therein.
Genetic interactions are highly informative for deciphering the underlying functional principles that govern how genes control cell processes. Recent developments in Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) analysis enable the mapping of quantitative genetic interactions on a genome-wide scale. To facilitate access to this resource, which will ultimately represent a complete genetic interaction network for a eukaryotic cell, we developed DRYGIN (Data Repository of Yeast Genetic Interactions)—a web database system that aims at providing a central platform for yeast genetic network analysis and visualization. In addition to providing an interface for searching the SGA genetic interactions, DRYGIN also integrates other data sources, in order to associate the genetic interactions with pathway information, protein complexes, other binary genetic and physical interactions, and Gene Ontology functional annotation. DRYGIN version 1.0 currently holds more than 5.4 million measurements of genetic interacting pairs involving ∼4500 genes, and is available at http://drygin.ccbr.utoronto.ca
‘Recoding’ is a term used to describe non-standard read-out of the genetic code, and encompasses such phenomena as programmed ribosomal frameshifting, stop codon readthrough, selenocysteine insertion and translational bypassing. Although only a small proportion of genes utilize recoding in protein synthesis, accurate annotation of ‘recoded’ genes lags far behind annotation of ‘standard’ genes. In order to address this issue, provide a service to researchers in the field, and offer training data for developers of gene-annotation software, we have gathered together known cases of recoding within the Recode database. Recode-2 is an improved and updated version of the database. It provides access to detailed information on genes known to utilize translational recoding and allows complex search queries, browsing of recoding data and enhanced visualization of annotated sequence elements. At present, the Recode-2 database stores information on approximately 1500 genes that are known to utilize recoding in their expression—a factor of approximately three increase over the previous version of the database. Recode-2 is available at http://recode.ucc.ie
The NCBI BioSystems database, found at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosystems/, centralizes and cross-links existing biological systems databases, increasing their utility and target audience by integrating their pathways and systems into NCBI resources. This integration allows users of NCBI's Entrez databases to quickly categorize proteins, genes and small molecules by metabolic pathway, disease state or other BioSystem type, without requiring time-consuming inference of biological relationships from the literature or multiple experimental datasets.
The University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (UM-BBD, http://umbbd.msi.umn.edu/) began in 1995 and now contains information on almost 1200 compounds, over 800 enzymes, almost 1300 reactions and almost 500 microorganism entries. Besides these data, it includes a Biochemical Periodic Table (UM-BPT) and a rule-based Pathway Prediction System (UM-PPS) (http://umbbd.msi.umn.edu/predict/) that predicts plausible pathways for microbial degradation of organic compounds. Currently, the UM-PPS contains 260 biotransformation rules derived from reactions found in the UM-BBD and scientific literature. Public access to UM-BBD data is increasing. UM-BBD compound data are now contributed to PubChem and ChemSpider, the public chemical databases. A new mirror website of the UM-BBD, UM-BPT and UM-PPS is being developed at ETH Zürich to improve speed and reliability of online access from anywhere in the world.
Much of the information on the Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is spread across literature and the internet. Aggregating knowledge about CYPs into one database makes the search more efficient. Text mining on 57 CYPs and drugs led to a mass of papers, which were screened manually for facts about metabolism, SNPs and their effects on drug degradation. Information was put into a database, which enables the user not only to look up a particular CYP and all metabolized drugs, but also to check tolerability of drug-cocktails and to find alternative combinations, to use metabolic pathways more efficiently. The SuperCYP database contains 1170 drugs with more than 3800 interactions including references. Approximately 2000 SNPs and mutations are listed and ordered according to their effect on expression and/or activity. SuperCYP (http://bioinformatics.charite.de/supercyp) is a comprehensive resource focused on CYPs and drug metabolism. Homology-modeled structures of the CYPs can be downloaded in PDB format and related drugs are available as MOL-files. Within the resource, CYPs can be aligned with each other, drug-cocktails can be ‘mixed’, SNPs, protein point mutations, and their effects can be viewed and corresponding PubMed IDs are given. SuperCYP is meant to be a platform and a starting point for scientists and health professionals for furthering their research.
The Negatome is a collection of protein and domain pairs that are unlikely to be engaged in direct physical interactions. The database currently contains experimentally supported non-interacting protein pairs derived from two distinct sources: by manual curation of literature and by analyzing protein complexes with known 3D structure. More stringent lists of non-interacting pairs were derived from these two datasets by excluding interactions detected by high-throughput approaches. Additionally, non-interacting protein domains have been derived from the stringent manual and structural data, respectively. The Negatome is much less biased toward functionally dissimilar proteins than the negative data derived by randomly selecting proteins from different cellular locations. It can be used to evaluate protein and domain interactions from new experiments and improve the training of interaction prediction algorithms. The Negatome database is available at http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/ppi/negatome.
The internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) is a widely used phylogenetic marker. In the past, it has mainly been used for species level classifications. Nowadays, a wider applicability becomes apparent. Here, the conserved structure of the RNA molecule plays a vital role. We have developed the ITS2 Database (http://its2.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de) which holds information about sequence, structure and taxonomic classification of all ITS2 in GenBank. In the new version, we use Hidden Markov models (HMMs) for the identification and delineation of the ITS2 resulting in a major redesign of the annotation pipeline. This allowed the identification of more than 160 000 correct full length and more than 50 000 partial structures. In the web interface, these can now be searched with a modified BLAST considering both sequence and structure, enabling rapid taxon sampling. Novel sequences can be annotated using the HMM based approach and modelled according to multiple template structures. Sequences can be searched for known and newly identified motifs. Together, the database and the web server build an exhaustive resource for ITS2 based phylogenetic analyses.
REBASE is a comprehensive database of information about restriction enzymes, DNA methyltransferases and related proteins involved in the biological process of restriction–modification (R–M). It contains fully referenced information about recognition and cleavage sites, isoschizomers, neoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. Experimentally characterized homing endonucleases are also included. The fastest growing segment of REBASE contains the putative R–M systems found in the sequence databases. Comprehensive descriptions of the R–M content of all fully sequenced genomes are available including summary schematics. The contents of REBASE may be browsed from the web (http://rebase.neb.com) and selected compilations can be downloaded by ftp (ftp.neb.com). Additionally, monthly updates can be requested via email.
The InParanoid project gathers proteomes of completely sequenced eukaryotic species plus Escherichia coli and calculates pairwise ortholog relationships among them. The new release 7.0 of the database has grown by an order of magnitude over the previous version and now includes 100 species and their collective 1.3 million proteins organized into 42.7 million pairwise ortholog groups. The InParanoid algorithm itself has been revised and is now both more specific and sensitive. Based on results from our recent benchmarking of low-complexity filters in homology assignment, a two-pass BLAST approach was developed that makes use of high-precision compositional score matrix adjustment, but avoids the alignment truncation that sometimes follows. We have also updated the InParanoid web site (http://InParanoid.sbc.su.se). Several features have been added, the response times have been improved and the site now sports a new, clearer look. As the number of ortholog databases has grown, it has become difficult to compare among these resources due to a lack of standardized source data and incompatible representations of ortholog relationships. To facilitate data exchange and comparisons among ortholog databases, we have developed and are making available two XML schemas: SeqXML for the input sequences and OrthoXML for the output ortholog clusters.
IMGT/3Dstructure-DB is the three-dimensional (3D) structure database of IMGT®, the international ImMunoGenetics information system® that is acknowledged as the global reference in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. IMGT/3Dstructure-DB contains 3D structures of immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, antigen receptor/antigen complexes (IG/Ag, TR/peptide/MHC) of vertebrates; 3D structures of related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of vertebrates and invertebrates, belonging to the immunoglobulin and MHC superfamilies (IgSF and MhcSF, respectively) and found in complexes with IG, TR or MHC. IMGT/3Dstructure-DB data are annotated according to the IMGT criteria, using IMGT/DomainGapAlign, and based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts and axioms. IMGT/3Dstructure-DB provides IMGT gene and allele identification (CLASSIFICATION), region and domain delimitations (DESCRIPTION), amino acid positions according to the IMGT unique numbering (NUMEROTATION) that are used in IMGT/3Dstructure-DB cards, results of contact analysis and renumbered flat files. In its Web version, the IMGT/DomainGapAlign tool analyses amino acid sequences, per domain. Coupled to the IMGT/Collier-de-Perles tool, it provides an invaluable help for antibody engineering and humanization design based on complementarity determining region (CDR) grafting as it precisely defines the standardized framework regions (FR-IMGT) and CDR-IMGT. IMGT/3Dstructure-DB and IMGT/DomainGapAlign are freely available at http://www.imgt.org.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and are therefore important cellular components. As is true for protein-coding genes, the transcription of miRNAs is regulated by transcription factors (TFs), an important class of gene regulators that act at the transcriptional level. The correct regulation of miRNAs by TFs is critical, and increasing evidence indicates that aberrant regulation of miRNAs by TFs can cause phenotypic variations and diseases. Therefore, a TF–miRNA regulation database would be helpful for understanding the mechanisms by which TFs regulate miRNAs and understanding their contribution to diseases. In this study, we manually surveyed approximately 5000 reports in the literature and identified 243 TF–miRNA regulatory relationships, which were supported experimentally from 86 publications. We used these data to build a TF–miRNA regulatory database (TransmiR, http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/transmir), which contains 82 TFs and 100 miRNAs with 243 regulatory pairs between TFs and miRNAs. In addition, we included references to the published literature (PubMed ID) information about the organism in which the relationship was found, whether the TFs and miRNAs are involved with tumors, miRNA function annotation and miRNA-associated disease annotation. TransmiR provides a user-friendly interface by which interested parties can easily retrieve TF–miRNA regulatory pairs by searching for either a miRNA or a TF.
FlyTED, the Drosophila Testis Gene Expression Database, is a biological research database for gene expression images from the testis of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. It currently contains 2762 mRNA in situ hybridization images and ancillary metadata revealing the patterns of gene expression of 817 Drosophila genes in testes of wild type flies and of seven meiotic arrest mutant strains in which spermatogenesis is defective. This database has been built by adapting a widely used digital library repository software system, EPrints (http://eprints.org/software/), and provides both web-based search and browse interfaces, and programmatic access via an SQL dump, OAI-PMH and SPARQL. FlyTED is available at http://www.fly-ted.org/.
We have developed phiSITE, database of gene regulation in bacteriophages. To date it contains detailed information about more than 700 experimentally confirmed or predicted regulatory elements (promoters, operators, terminators and attachment sites) from 32 bacteriophages belonging to Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae families. The database is manually curated, the data are collected mainly form scientific papers, cross-referenced with other database resources (EMBL, UniProt, NCBI taxonomy database, NCBI Genome, ICTVdb, PubMed Central) and stored in SQL based database system. The system provides full text search for regulatory elements, graphical visualization of phage genomes and several export options. In addition, visualizations of gene regulatory networks for five phages (Bacillus phage GA-1, Enterobacteria phage lambda, Enterobacteria phage Mu, Enterobacteria phage P2 and Mycoplasma phage P1) have been defined and made available. The phiSITE is accessible at http://www.phisite.org/.
During cell division/mitosis, a specific subset of proteins is spatially and temporally assembled into protein super complexes in three distinct regions, i.e. centrosome/spindle pole, kinetochore/centromere and midbody/cleavage furrow/phragmoplast/bud neck, and modulates cell division process faithfully. Although many experimental efforts have been carried out to investigate the characteristics of these proteins, no integrated database was available. Here, we present the MiCroKit database (http://microkit.biocuckoo.org) of proteins that localize in midbody, centrosome and/or kinetochore. We collected into the MiCroKit database experimentally verified microkit proteins from the scientific literature that have unambiguous supportive evidence for subcellular localization under fluorescent microscope. The current version of MiCroKit 3.0 provides detailed information for 1489 microkit proteins from seven model organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizasaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens. Moreover, the orthologous information was provided for these microkit proteins, and could be a useful resource for further experimental identification. The online service of MiCroKit database was implemented in PHP + MySQL + JavaScript, while the local packages were developed in JAVA 1.5 (J2SE 5.0).
IBIS is the NCBI Inferred Biomolecular Interaction Server. This server organizes, analyzes and predicts interaction partners and locations of binding sites in proteins. IBIS provides annotations for different types of binding partners (protein, chemical, nucleic acid and peptides), and facilitates the mapping of a comprehensive biomolecular interaction network for a given protein query. IBIS reports interactions observed in experimentally determined structural complexes of a given protein, and at the same time IBIS infers binding sites/interacting partners by inspecting protein complexes formed by homologous proteins. Similar binding sites are clustered together based on their sequence and structure conservation. To emphasize biologically relevant binding sites, several algorithms are used for verification in terms of evolutionary conservation, biological importance of binding partners, size and stability of interfaces, as well as evidence from the published literature. IBIS is updated regularly and is freely accessible via http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/ibis/ibis.html.
Peptidome is a public repository that archives and freely distributes tandem mass spectrometry peptide and protein identification data generated by the scientific community. Data from all stages of a mass spectrometry experiment are captured, including original mass spectra files, experimental metadata and conclusion-level results. The submission process is facilitated through acceptance of data in commonly used open formats, and all submissions undergo syntactic validation and curation in an effort to uphold data integrity and quality. Peptidome is not restricted to specific organisms, instruments or experiment types; data from any tandem mass spectrometry experiment from any species are accepted. In addition to data storage, web-based interfaces are available to help users query, browse and explore individual peptides, proteins or entire Samples and Studies. Results are integrated and linked with other NCBI resources to ensure dissemination of the information beyond the mass spectroscopy proteomics community. Peptidome is freely accessible at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/peptidome.
JASPAR (http://jaspar.genereg.net) is the leading open-access database of matrix profiles describing the DNA-binding patterns of transcription factors (TFs) and other proteins interacting with DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Its fourth major release is the largest expansion of the core database to date: the database now holds 457 non-redundant, curated profiles. The new entries include the first batch of profiles derived from ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip whole-genome binding experiments, and 177 yeast TF binding profiles. The introduction of a yeast division brings the convenience of JASPAR to an active research community. As binding models are refined by newer data, the JASPAR database now uses versioning of matrices: in this release, 12% of the older models were updated to improved versions. Classification of TF families has been improved by adopting a new DNA-binding domain nomenclature. A curated catalog of mammalian TFs is provided, extending the use of the JASPAR profiles to additional TFs belonging to the same structural family. The changes in the database set the system ready for more rapid acquisition of new high-throughput data sources. Additionally, three new special collections provide matrix profile data produced by recent alternative high-throughput approaches.
The Aspergillus Genome Database (AspGD) is an online genomics resource for researchers studying the genetics and molecular biology of the Aspergilli. AspGD combines high-quality manual curation of the experimental scientific literature examining the genetics and molecular biology of Aspergilli, cutting-edge comparative genomics approaches to iteratively refine and improve structural gene annotations across multiple Aspergillus species, and web-based research tools for accessing and exploring the data. All of these data are freely available at http://www.aspgd.org. We welcome feedback from users and the research community at aspergillus-curator@genome.stanford.edu.
About 15% of human colorectal cancers and, at varying degrees, other tumor entities as well as nearly all tumors related to Lynch syndrome are hallmarked by microsatellite instability (MSI) as a result of a defective mismatch repair system. The functional impact of resulting mutations depends on their genomic localization. Alterations within coding mononucleotide repeat tracts (MNRs) can lead to protein truncation and formation of neopeptides, whereas alterations within untranslated MNRs can alter transcription level or transcript stability. These mutations may provide selective advantage or disadvantage to affected cells. They may further concern the biology of microsatellite unstable cells, e.g. by generating immunogenic peptides induced by frameshifts mutations. The Selective Targets database (http://www.seltarbase.org) is a curated database of a growing number of public MNR mutation data in microsatellite unstable human tumors. Regression calculations for various MSI–H tumor entities indicating statistically deviant mutation frequencies predict TGFBR2, BAX, ACVR2A and others that are shown or highly suspected to be involved in MSI tumorigenesis. Many useful tools for further analyzing genomic DNA, derived wild-type and mutated cDNAs and peptides are integrated. A comprehensive database of all human coding, untranslated, non-coding RNA- and intronic MNRs (MNR_ensembl) is also included. Herewith, SelTarbase presents as a plenty instrument for MSI-carcinogenesis-related research, diagnostics and therapy.
Pfam is a widely used database of protein families and domains. This article describes a set of major updates that we have implemented in the latest release (version 24.0). The most important change is that we now use HMMER3, the latest version of the popular profile hidden Markov model package. This software is ∼100 times faster than HMMER2 and is more sensitive due to the routine use of the forward algorithm. The move to HMMER3 has necessitated numerous changes to Pfam that are described in detail. Pfam release 24.0 contains 11 912 families, of which a large number have been significantly updated during the past two years. Pfam is available via servers in the UK (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/), the USA (http://pfam.janelia.org/) and Sweden (http://pfam.sbc.su.se/).
IntAct is an open-source, open data molecular interaction database and toolkit. Data is abstracted from the literature or from direct data depositions by expert curators following a deep annotation model providing a high level of detail. As of September 2009, IntAct contains over 200.000 curated binary interaction evidences. In response to the growing data volume and user requests, IntAct now provides a two-tiered view of the interaction data. The search interface allows the user to iteratively develop complex queries, exploiting the detailed annotation with hierarchical controlled vocabularies. Results are provided at any stage in a simplified, tabular view. Specialized views then allows ‘zooming in’ on the full annotation of interactions, interactors and their properties. IntAct source code and data are freely available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact.
The Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/) is a set of specialist databases related to the study of polymorphic genes in the immune system. The IPD project works with specialist groups or nomenclature committees who provide and curate individual sections before they are submitted to IPD for online publication. The IPD project stores all the data in a set of related databases. IPD currently consists of four databases: IPD-KIR, contains the allelic sequences of Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors, IPD-MHC, is a database of sequences of the Major Histocompatibility Complex of different species; IPD-human platelet antigens, alloantigens expressed only on platelets and IPD-ESTDAB, which provides access to the European Searchable Tumour cell-line database, a cell bank of immunologically characterised melanoma cell lines. The data is currently available online from the website and ftp directory.
Most human diseases are complex multi-factorial diseases resulting from the combination of various genetic and environmental factors. In the KEGG database resource (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), diseases are viewed as perturbed states of the molecular system, and drugs as perturbants to the molecular system. Disease information is computerized in two forms: pathway maps and gene/molecule lists. The KEGG PATHWAY database contains pathway maps for the molecular systems in both normal and perturbed states. In the KEGG DISEASE database, each disease is represented by a list of known disease genes, any known environmental factors at the molecular level, diagnostic markers and therapeutic drugs, which may reflect the underlying molecular system. The KEGG DRUG database contains chemical structures and/or chemical components of all drugs in Japan, including crude drugs and TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) formulas, and drugs in the USA and Europe. This database also captures knowledge about two types of molecular networks: the interaction network with target molecules, metabolizing enzymes, other drugs, etc. and the chemical structure transformation network in the history of drug development. The new disease/drug information resource named KEGG MEDICUS can be used as a reference knowledge base for computational analysis of molecular networks, especially, by integrating large-scale experimental datasets.
H-DBAS (http://h-invitational.jp/h-dbas/) is a specialized database for human alternative splicing (AS) based on H-Invitational full-length cDNAs. In this update, for better annotations of AS events, we correlated RNA-Seq tag information to the AS exons and splice junctions. We generated a total of 148 376 598 RNA-Seq tags from RNAs extracted from cytoplasmic, nuclear and polysome fractions. Analysis of the RNA-Seq tags allowed us to identify 90 900 exons that are very likely to be used for protein synthesis. On the other hand, 254 AS junctions of human RefSeq transcripts are unique to nuclear RNA and may not have any translational consequences. We also present a new comparative genomics viewer so that users can empirically understand the evolutionary turnover of AS. With the unique experimental data closely connected with intensively curated cDNA information, H-DBAS provides a unique platform for the analysis of complex AS.
The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) is a major component of the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI, http://www.informatics.jax.org/) database resource and serves as the primary community model organism database for the laboratory mouse. MGD is the authoritative source for mouse gene, allele and strain nomenclature and for phenotype and functional annotations of mouse genes. MGD contains comprehensive data and information related to mouse genes and their functions, standardized descriptions of mouse phenotypes, extensive integration of DNA and protein sequence data, normalized representation of genome and genome variant information including comparative data on mammalian genes. Data for MGD are obtained from diverse sources including manual curation of the biomedical literature and direct contributions from individual investigator's laboratories and major informatics resource centers, such as Ensembl, UniProt and NCBI. MGD collaborates with the bioinformatics community on the development and use of biomedical ontologies such as the Gene Ontology and the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology. Recent improvements in MGD described here includes integration of mouse gene trap allele and sequence data, integration of gene targeting information from the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, deployment of an MGI Biomart, and enhancements to our batch query capability for customized data access and retrieval.
The identification of orthologous relationships forms the basis for most comparative genomics studies. Here, we present the second version of the eggNOG database, which contains orthologous groups (OGs) constructed through identification of reciprocal best BLAST matches and triangular linkage clustering. We applied this procedure to 630 complete genomes (529 bacteria, 46 archaea and 55 eukaryotes), which is a 2-fold increase relative to the previous version. The pipeline yielded 224 847 OGs, including 9724 extended versions of the original COG and KOG. We computed OGs for different levels of the tree of life; in addition to the species groups included in our first release (i.e. fungi, metazoa, insects, vertebrates and mammals), we have now constructed OGs for archaea, fishes, rodents and primates. We automatically annotate the non-supervised orthologous groups (NOGs) with functional descriptions, protein domains, and functional categories as defined initially for the COG/KOG database. In-depth analysis is facilitated by precomputed high-quality multiple sequence alignments and maximum-likelihood trees for each of the available OGs. Altogether, eggNOG covers 2 242 035 proteins (built from 2 590 259 proteins) and provides a broad functional description for at least 1 966 709 (88%) of them. Users can access the complete set of orthologous groups via a web interface at: http://eggnog.embl.de.
MouseIndelDB is an integrated database resource containing thousands of previously unreported mouse genomic indel (insertion and deletion) polymorphisms ranging from ∼100 nt to 10 Kb in size. The database currently includes polymorphisms identified from our alignment of 26 million whole-genome shotgun sequence traces from four laboratory mouse strains mapped against the reference C57BL/6J genome using GMAP. They can be queried on a local level by chromosomal coordinates, nearby gene names or other genomic feature identifiers, or in bulk format using categories including mouse strain(s), class of polymorphism(s) and chromosome number. The results of such queries are presented either as a custom track on the UCSC mouse genome browser or in tabular format. We anticipate that the MouseIndelDB database will be widely useful for research in mammalian genetics, genomics, and evolutionary biology. Access to the MouseIndelDB database is freely available at: http://variation.osu.edu/.
FlyTF (http://www.flytf.org) is a database of computationally predicted and/or experimentally verified site-specific transcription factors (TFs) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The manual classification of TFs in the initial version of FlyTF that concentrated primarily on the DNA-binding characteristics of the proteins has now been extended to a more fine-grained annotation of both DNA binding and regulatory properties in the new release. Furthermore, experimental evidence from the literature was classified into a defined vocabulary, and in collaboration with FlyBase, translated into Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. While our GO annotations will also be available through FlyBase as they will be incorporated into the genes' official GO annotation in the future, the entire evidence used for classification including computational predictions and quotes from the literature can be accessed through FlyTF. The FlyTF website now builds upon the InterMine framework, which provides experimental and computational biologists with powerful search and filter functionality, list management tools and access to genomic information associated with the TFs.
The broad aim of biomedical science in the postgenomic era is to link genomic and phenotype information to allow deeper understanding of the processes leading from genomic changes to altered phenotype and disease. The EuroPhenome project (http://www.EuroPhenome.org) is a comprehensive resource for raw and annotated high-throughput phenotyping data arising from projects such as EUMODIC. EUMODIC is gathering data from the EMPReSSslim pipeline (http://www.empress.har.mrc.ac.uk/) which is performed on inbred mouse strains and knock-out lines arising from the EUCOMM project. The EuroPhenome interface allows the user to access the data via the phenotype or genotype. It also allows the user to access the data in a variety of ways, including graphical display, statistical analysis and access to the raw data via web services. The raw phenotyping data captured in EuroPhenome is annotated by an annotation pipeline which automatically identifies statistically different mutants from the appropriate baseline and assigns ontology terms for that specific test. Mutant phenotypes can be quickly identified using two EuroPhenome tools: PhenoMap, a graphical representation of statistically relevant phenotypes, and mining for a mutant using ontology terms. To assist with data definition and cross-database comparisons, phenotype data is annotated using combinations of terms from biological ontologies.
Insertion sequences (ISs) are among the smallest and simplest autonomous transposable elements. ISfinder (http://www-is.biotoul.fr/) is a dedicated IS database which assigns names to individual ISs to maintain a coherent nomenclature, an IS repository including >3000 individual ISs from both bacteria and archaea and provides a basis for IS classification. Each IS is indexed in ISfinder with various associated pieces of information (the complete nucleotide sequence, the sequence of the ends and target sites, potential open reading frames, strain of origin, distribution in other strains and available bibliography) and classified into a group or family to provide some insight into its phylogeny. ISfinder also includes extensive background information on ISs and transposons in general. Online tools are gradually being added. At present, it is difficult to visualize the global distribution of ISs in a given bacterial genome. Such information would facilitate understanding of the impact of these small transposable elements on shaping their host genome. Here we describe ISbrowser (http://www-genome.biotoul.fr/ISbrowser.php), an extension to the ISfinder platform and a tool which permits visualization of the position, orientation and distribution of complete and partial ISs in individual prokaryotic genomes.
The MetaCyc database (MetaCyc.org) is a comprehensive and freely accessible resource for metabolic pathways and enzymes from all domains of life. The pathways in MetaCyc are experimentally determined, small-molecule metabolic pathways and are curated from the primary scientific literature. With more than 1400 pathways, MetaCyc is the largest collection of metabolic pathways currently available. Pathways reactions are linked to one or more well-characterized enzymes, and both pathways and enzymes are annotated with reviews, evidence codes, and literature citations. BioCyc (BioCyc.org) is a collection of more than 500 organism-specific Pathway/Genome Databases (PGDBs). Each BioCyc PGDB contains the full genome and predicted metabolic network of one organism. The network, which is predicted by the Pathway Tools software using MetaCyc as a reference, consists of metabolites, enzymes, reactions and metabolic pathways. BioCyc PGDBs also contain additional features, such as predicted operons, transport systems, and pathway hole-fillers. The BioCyc Web site offers several tools for the analysis of the PGDBs, including Omics Viewers that enable visualization of omics datasets on two different genome-scale diagrams and tools for comparative analysis. The BioCyc PGDBs generated by SRI are offered for adoption by any party interested in curation of metabolic, regulatory, and genome-related information about an organism.
In addition to maintaining the GenBank® nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides analysis and retrieval resources for the data in GenBank and other biological data made available through the NCBI web site. NCBI resources include Entrez, the Entrez Programming Utilities, MyNCBI, PubMed, PubMed Central, Entrez Gene, the NCBI Taxonomy Browser, BLAST, BLAST Link (BLink), Electronic PCR, OrfFinder, Spidey, Splign, Reference Sequence, UniGene, HomoloGene, ProtEST, dbMHC, dbSNP, Cancer Chromosomes, Entrez Genomes and related tools, the Map Viewer, Model Maker, Evidence Viewer, Trace Archive, Sequence Read Archive, Retroviral Genotyping Tools, HIV-1/Human Protein Interaction Database, Gene Expression Omnibus, Entrez Probe, GENSAT, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals, the Molecular Modeling Database, the Conserved Domain Database, the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool, Biosystems, Peptidome, Protein Clusters and the PubChem suite of small molecule databases. Augmenting many of the web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets. All these resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
Peptidases, their substrates and inhibitors are of great relevance to biology, medicine and biotechnology. The MEROPS database (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk) aims to fulfil the need for an integrated source of information about these. The database has a hierarchical classification in which homologous sets of peptidases and protein inhibitors are grouped into protein species, which are grouped into families, which are in turn grouped into clans. The classification framework is used for attaching information at each level. An important focus of the database has become distinguishing one peptidase from another through identifying the specificity of the peptidase in terms of where it will cleave substrates and with which inhibitors it will interact. We have collected over 39 000 known cleavage sites in proteins, peptides and synthetic substrates. These allow us to display peptidase specificity and alignments of protein substrates to give an indication of how well a cleavage site is conserved, and thus its probable physiological relevance. While the number of new peptidase families and clans has only grown slowly the number of complete genomes has greatly increased. This has allowed us to add an analysis tool to the relevant species pages to show significant gains and losses of peptidase genes relative to related species.
The Patrocles database (http://www.patrocles.org/) compiles DNA sequence polymorphisms (DSPs) that are predicted to perturb miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Distinctive features include: (i) the coverage of seven vertebrate species in its present release, aiming for more when information becomes available, (ii) the coverage of the three compartments involved in the silencing process (i.e. targets, miRNA precursors and silencing machinery), (iii) contextual information that enables users to prioritize candidate ‘Patrocles DSPs’, including graphical information on miRNA-target coexpression and eQTL effect of genotype on target expression levels, (iv) the inclusion of Copy Number Variants and eQTL information that affect miRNA precursors as well as genes encoding components of the silencing machinery and (v) a tool (Patrocles finder) that allows the user to determine whether her favorite DSP may perturb miRNA-mediated gene regulation of custom target sequences. To support the biological relevance of Patrocles' content, we searched for signatures of selection acting on ‘Patrocles single nucleotide polymorphisms (pSNPs)’ in human and mice. As expected, we found a strong signature of purifying selection against not only SNPs that destroy conserved target sites but also against SNPs that create novel, illegitimate target sites, which is reminiscent of the Texel mutation in sheep.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are ∼21 nucleotide-long non-coding small RNAs, which function as post-transcriptional regulators in eukaryotes. miRNAs play essential roles in regulating plant growth and development. In recent years, research into the mechanism and consequences of miRNA action has made great progress. With whole genome sequence available in such plants as Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa, Glycine max, etc., it is desirable to develop a plant miRNA database through the integration of large amounts of information about publicly deposited miRNA data. The plant miRNA database (PMRD) integrates available plant miRNA data deposited in public databases, gleaned from the recent literature, and data generated in-house. This database contains sequence information, secondary structure, target genes, expression profiles and a genome browser. In total, there are 8433 miRNAs collected from 121 plant species in PMRD, including model plants and major crops such as Arabidopsis, rice, wheat, soybean, maize, sorghum, barley, etc. For Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, soybean, cotton, medicago and maize, we included the possible target genes for each miRNA with a predicted interaction site in the database. Furthermore, we provided miRNA expression profiles in the PMRD, including our local rice oxidative stress related microarray data (LC Sciences miRPlants_10.1) and the recently published microarray data for poplar, Arabidopsis, tomato, maize and rice. The PMRD database was constructed by open source technology utilizing a user-friendly web interface, and multiple search tools. The PMRD is freely available at http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/PMRD. We expect PMRD to be a useful tool for scientists in the miRNA field in order to study the function of miRNAs and their target genes, especially in model plants and major crops.
The MiST2 database (http://mistdb.com) identifies and catalogs the repertoire of signal transduction proteins in microbial genomes. Signal transduction systems regulate the majority of cellular activities including the metabolism, development, host-recognition, biofilm production, virulence, and antibiotic resistance of human pathogens. Thus, knowledge of the proteins and interactions that comprise these communication networks is an essential component to furthering biomedical discovery. These are identified by searching protein sequences for specific domain profiles that implicate a protein in signal transduction. Compared to the previous version of the database, MiST2 contains a host of new features and improvements including the following: draft genomes; extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor protein identification; enhanced classification of signaling proteins; novel, high-quality domain models for identifying histidine kinases and response regulators; neighboring two-component genes; gene cart; better search capabilities; enhanced taxonomy browser; advanced genome browser; and a modern, biologist-friendly web interface. MiST2 currently contains 966 complete and 157 draft bacterial and archaeal genomes, which collectively contain more than 245 000 signal transduction proteins. The majority (66%) of these are one-component systems, followed by two-component proteins (26%), chemotaxis (6%), and finally ECF factors (2%).
The Plant Transcription Factor Database (PlnTFDB; http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/) is an integrative database that provides putatively complete sets of transcription factors (TFs) and other transcriptional regulators (TRs) in plant species (sensu lato) whose genomes have been completely sequenced and annotated. The complete sets of 84 families of TFs and TRs from 19 species ranging from unicellular red and green algae to angiosperms are included in PlnTFDB, representing >1.6 billion years of evolution of gene regulatory networks. For each gene family, a basic description is provided that is complemented by literature references, and multiple sequence alignments of protein domains. TF or TR gene entries include information of expressed sequence tags, 3D protein structures of homologous proteins, domain architecture and cross-links to other computational resources online. Moreover, the different species in PlnTFDB are linked to each other by means of orthologous genes facilitating cross-species comparisons.
Large collections of protein-encoding open reading frames (ORFs) established in a versatile recombination-based cloning system have been instrumental to study protein functions in high-throughput assays. Such ‘ORFeome’ resources have been developed for several organisms but in virology, plasmid collections covering a significant fraction of the virosphere are still needed. In this perspective, we present ViralORFeome 1.0 (http://www.viralorfeome.com), an open-access database and management system that provides an integrated set of bioinformatic tools to clone viral ORFs in the Gateway® system. ViralORFeome provides a convenient interface to navigate through virus genome sequences, to design ORF-specific cloning primers, to validate the sequence of generated constructs and to browse established collections of virus ORFs. Most importantly, ViralORFeome has been designed to manage all possible variants or mutants of a given ORF so that the cloning procedure can be applied to any emerging virus strain. A subset of plasmid constructs generated with ViralORFeome platform has been tested with success for heterologous protein expression in different expression systems at proteome scale. ViralORFeome should provide our community with a framework to establish a large collection of virus ORF clones, an instrumental resource to determine functions, activities and binding partners of viral proteins.
The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; http://www.yeastgenome.org) is a scientific database for the molecular biology and genetics of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is commonly known as baker's or budding yeast. The information in SGD includes functional annotations, mapping and sequence information, protein domains and structure, expression data, mutant phenotypes, physical and genetic interactions and the primary literature from which these data are derived. Here we describe how published phenotypes and genetic interaction data are annotated and displayed in SGD.
BioDrugScreen is a resource for ranking molecules docked against a large number of targets in the human proteome. Nearly 1600 molecules from the freely available NCI diversity set were docked onto 1926 cavities identified on 1589 human targets resulting in >3 million receptor–ligand complexes requiring >200 000 cpu-hours on the TeraGrid. The targets in BioDrugScreen originated from Human Cancer Protein Interaction Network, which we have updated, as well as the Human Druggable Proteome, which we have created for the purpose of this effort. This makes the BioDrugScreen resource highly valuable in drug discovery. The receptor–ligand complexes within the database can be ranked using standard and well-established scoring functions like AutoDock, DockScore, ChemScore, X-Score, GoldScore, DFIRE and PMF. In addition, we have scored the complexes with more intensive GBSA and PBSA approaches requiring an additional 120 000 cpu-hours on the TeraGrid. We constructed a simple interface to enable users to view top-ranking molecules and access purchasing and other information for further experimental exploration.
Linear motifs are short segments of multidomain proteins that provide regulatory functions independently of protein tertiary structure. Much of intracellular signalling passes through protein modifications at linear motifs. Many thousands of linear motif instances, most notably phosphorylation sites, have now been reported. Although clearly very abundant, linear motifs are difficult to predict de novo in protein sequences due to the difficulty of obtaining robust statistical assessments. The ELM resource at http://elm.eu.org/ provides an expanding knowledge base, currently covering 146 known motifs, with annotation that includes >1300 experimentally reported instances. ELM is also an exploratory tool for suggesting new candidates of known linear motifs in proteins of interest. Information about protein domains, protein structure and native disorder, cellular and taxonomic contexts is used to reduce or deprecate false positive matches. Results are graphically displayed in a ‘Bar Code’ format, which also displays known instances from homologous proteins through a novel ‘Instance Mapper’ protocol based on PHI-BLAST. ELM server output provides links to the ELM annotation as well as to a number of remote resources. Using the links, researchers can explore the motifs, proteins, complex structures and associated literature to evaluate whether candidate motifs might be worth experimental investigation.
The integrated microbial genomes (IMG) system serves as a community resource for comparative analysis of publicly available genomes in a comprehensive integrated context. IMG contains both draft and complete microbial genomes integrated with other publicly available genomes from all three domains of life, together with a large number of plasmids and viruses. IMG provides tools and viewers for analyzing and reviewing the annotations of genes and genomes in a comparative context. Since its first release in 2005, IMG's data content and analytical capabilities have been constantly expanded through regular releases. Several companion IMG systems have been set up in order to serve domain specific needs, such as expert review of genome annotations. IMG is available at http://img.jgi.doe.gov.
The catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/) is the largest public resource for information on somatically acquired mutations in human cancer and is available freely without restrictions. Currently (v43, August 2009), COSMIC contains details of 1.5-million experiments performed through 13 423 genes in almost 370 000 tumours, describing over 90 000 individual mutations. Data are gathered from two sources, publications in the scientific literature, (v43 contains 7797 curated articles) and the full output of the genome-wide screens from the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) at the Sanger Institute, UK. Most of the world's literature on point mutations in human cancer has now been curated into COSMIC and while this is continually updated, a greater emphasis on curating fusion gene mutations is driving the expansion of this information; over 2700 fusion gene mutations are now described. Whole-genome sequencing screens are now identifying large numbers of genomic rearrangements in cancer and COSMIC is now displaying details of these analyses also. Examination of COSMIC's data is primarily web-driven, focused on providing mutation range and frequency statistics based upon a choice of gene and/or cancer phenotype. Graphical views provide easily interpretable summaries of large quantities of data, and export functions can provide precise details of user-selected data.
MINT (http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/mint) is a public repository for molecular interactions reported in peer-reviewed journals. Since its last report, MINT has grown considerably in size and evolved in scope to meet the requirements of its users. The main changes include a more precise definition of the curation policy and the development of an enhanced and user-friendly interface to facilitate the analysis of the ever-growing interaction dataset. MINT has adopted the PSI-MI standards for the annotation and for the representation of molecular interactions and is a member of the IMEx consortium.
SoyBase, the USDA-ARS soybean genetic database, is a comprehensive repository for professionally curated genetics, genomics and related data resources for soybean. SoyBase contains the most current genetic, physical and genomic sequence maps integrated with qualitative and quantitative traits. The quantitative trait loci (QTL) represent more than 18 years of QTL mapping of more than 90 unique traits. SoyBase also contains the well-annotated ‘Williams 82’ genomic sequence and associated data mining tools. The genetic and sequence views of the soybean chromosomes and the extensive data on traits and phenotypes are extensively interlinked. This allows entry to the database using almost any kind of available information, such as genetic map symbols, soybean gene names or phenotypic traits. SoyBase is the repository for controlled vocabularies for soybean growth, development and trait terms, which are also linked to the more general plant ontologies. SoyBase can be accessed at http://soybase.org.
The Genomes On Line Database (GOLD) is a comprehensive resource for centralized monitoring of genome and metagenome projects worldwide. Both complete and ongoing projects, along with their associated metadata, can be accessed in GOLD through precomputed tables and a search page. As of September 2009, GOLD contains information for more than 5800 sequencing projects, of which 1100 have been completed and their sequence data deposited in a public repository. GOLD continues to expand, moving toward the goal of providing the most comprehensive repository of metadata information related to the projects and their organisms/environments in accordance with the Minimum Information about a (Meta)Genome Sequence (MIGS/MIMS) specification. GOLD is available at: http://www.genomesonline.org and has a mirror site at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Crete, Greece, at: http://gold.imbb.forth.gr/
The Protein Structure Initiative Material Repository (PSI-MR; http://psimr.asu.edu) provides centralized storage and distribution for the protein expression plasmids created by PSI researchers. These plasmids are a resource that allows the research community to dissect the biological function of proteins whose structures have been identified by the PSI. The plasmid annotation, which includes the full length sequence, vector information and associated publications, is stored in a freely available, searchable database called DNASU (http://dnasu.asu.edu). Each PSI plasmid is also linked to a variety of additional resources, which facilitates cross-referencing of a particular plasmid to protein annotations and experimental data. Plasmid samples can be requested directly through the website. We have also developed a novel strategy to avoid the most common concern encountered when distributing plasmids namely, the complexity of material transfer agreement (MTA) processing and the resulting delays this causes. The Expedited Process MTA, in which we created a network of institutions that agree to the terms of transfer in advance of a material request, eliminates these delays. Our hope is that by creating a repository of expression-ready plasmids and expediting the process for receiving these plasmids, we will help accelerate the accessibility and pace of scientific discovery.
We report the extended database and data mining resources newly released in the H-Invitational Database (H-InvDB; http://www.h-invitational.jp/). H-InvDB is a comprehensive annotation resource of human genes and transcripts, and consists of two main views and six sub-databases. The latest release of H-InvDB (release 6.2) provides the annotation for 219 765 human transcripts in 43 159 human gene clusters based on human full-length cDNAs and mRNAs. H-InvDB now provides several new annotation features, such as mapping of microarray probes, new gene models, relation to known ncRNAs and information from the Glycogene database. H-InvDB also provides useful data mining resources—‘Navigation search’, ‘H-InvDB Enrichment Analysis Tool (HEAT)’ and web service APIs. ‘Navigation search’ is an extended search system that enables complicated searches by combining 16 different search options. HEAT is a data mining tool for automatically identifying features specific to a given human gene set. HEAT searches for H-InvDB annotations that are significantly enriched in a user-defined gene set, as compared with the entire H-InvDB representative transcripts. H-InvDB now has web service APIs of SOAP and REST to allow the use of H-InvDB data in programs, providing the users extended data accessibility.
The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) provides public access to patent data, including abstracts, chemical compounds and sequences. Sequences can appear multiple times due to the filing of the same invention with multiple patent offices, or the use of the same sequence by different inventors in different contexts. Information relating to the source invention may be incomplete, and biological information available in patent documents elsewhere may not be reflected in the annotation of the sequence. Search and analysis of these data have become increasingly challenging for both the scientific and intellectual-property communities. Here, we report a collection of non-redundant patent sequence databases, which cover the EMBL-Bank nucleotides patent class and the patent protein databases and contain value-added annotations from patent documents. The databases were created at two levels by the use of sequence MD5 checksums. Sequences within a level-1 cluster are 100% identical over their whole length. Level-2 clusters were defined by sub-grouping level-1 clusters based on patent family information. Value-added annotations, such as publication number corrections, earliest publication dates and feature collations, significantly enhance the quality of the data, allowing for better tracking and cross-referencing. The databases are available format: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/patentdata/nr/.
The current issue of Nucleic Acids Research includes descriptions of 58 new and 73 updated data resources. The accompanying online Database Collection, available at http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/a/, now lists 1230 carefully selected databases covering various aspects of molecular and cell biology. While most data resource descriptions remain very brief, the issue includes several longer papers that highlight recent significant developments in such databases as Pfam, MetaCyc, UniProt, ELM and PDBe. The databases described in the Database Issue and Database Collection, however, are far more than a distinct set of resources; they form a network of connected data, concepts and shared technology. The full content of the Database Issue is available online at the Nucleic Acids Research web site (http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/).
Over the last years, the publicly available knowledge on interactions between small molecules and proteins has been steadily increasing. To create a network of interactions, STITCH aims to integrate the data dispersed over the literature and various databases of biological pathways, drug–target relationships and binding affinities. In STITCH 2, the number of relevant interactions is increased by incorporation of BindingDB, PharmGKB and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. The resulting network can be explored interactively or used as the basis for large-scale analyses. To facilitate links to other chemical databases, we adopt InChIKeys that allow identification of chemicals with a short, checksum-like string. STITCH 2.0 connects proteins from 630 organisms to over 74 000 different chemicals, including 2200 drugs. STITCH can be accessed at http://stitch.embl.de/.
The Gene Expression Atlas (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa) is an added-value database providing information about gene expression in different cell types, organism parts, developmental stages, disease states, sample treatments and other biological/experimental conditions. The content of this database derives from curation, re-annotation and statistical analysis of selected data from the ArrayExpress Archive of Functional Genomics Data. A simple interface allows the user to query for differential gene expression either (i) by gene names or attributes such as Gene Ontology terms, or (ii) by biological conditions, e.g. diseases, organism parts or cell types. The gene queries return the conditions where expression has been reported, while condition queries return which genes are reported to be expressed in these conditions. A combination of both query types is possible. The query results are ranked using various statistical measures and by how many independent studies in the database show the particular gene-condition association. Currently, the database contains information about more than 200 000 genes from nine species and almost 4500 biological conditions studied in over 30 000 assays from over 1000 independent studies.
The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is an international consortium of investigators funded to analyze the human genome with the goal of producing a comprehensive catalog of functional elements. The ENCODE Data Coordination Center at The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) is the primary repository for experimental results generated by ENCODE investigators. These results are captured in the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics database and download server for visualization and data mining via the UCSC Genome Browser and companion tools (Rhead et al. The UCSC Genome Browser Database: update 2010, in this issue). The ENCODE web portal at UCSC (http://encodeproject.org or http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE) provides information about the ENCODE data and convenient links for access.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are gaining popularity as better substitute to antibiotics. These peptides are shown to be active against several bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa and cancerous cells. Understanding the role of primary structure of AMPs in their specificity and activity is essential for their rational design as drugs. Collection of Anti-Microbial Peptides (CAMP) is a free online database that has been developed for advancement of the present understanding on antimicrobial peptides. It is manually curated and currently holds 3782 antimicrobial sequences. These sequences are divided into experimentally validated (patents and non-patents: 2766) and predicted (1016) datasets based on their reference literature. Information like source organism, activity (MIC values), reference literature, target and non-target organisms of AMPs are captured in the database. The experimentally validated dataset has been further used to develop prediction tools for AMPs based on the machine learning algorithms like Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Discriminant Analysis (DA). The prediction models gave accuracies of 93.2% (RF), 91.5% (SVM) and 87.5% (DA) on the test datasets. The prediction and sequence analysis tools, including BLAST, are integrated in the database. CAMP will be a useful database for study of sequence-activity and -specificity relationships in AMPs. CAMP is freely available at http://www.bicnirrh.res.in/antimicrobial.
The Gemina system (http://gemina.igs.umaryland.edu) identifies, standardizes and integrates the outbreak metadata for the breadth of NIAID category A–C viral and bacterial pathogens, thereby providing an investigative and surveillance tool describing the Who [Host], What [Disease, Symptom], When [Date], Where [Location] and How [Pathogen, Environmental Source, Reservoir, Transmission Method] for each pathogen. The Gemina database will provide a greater understanding of the interactions of viral and bacterial pathogens with their hosts and infectious diseases through in-depth literature text-mining, integrated outbreak metadata, outbreak surveillance tools, extensive ontology development, metadata curation and representative genomic sequence identification and standards development. The Gemina web interface provides metadata selection and retrieval of a pathogen's; Infection Systems (Pathogen, Host, Disease, Transmission Method and Anatomy) and Incidents (Location and Date) along with a hosts Age and Gender. The Gemina system provides an integrated investigative and geospatial surveillance system connecting pathogens, pathogen products and disease anchored on the taxonomic ID of the pathogen and host to identify the breadth of hosts and diseases known for these pathogens, to identify the extent of outbreak locations, and to identify unique genomic regions with the DNA Signature Insignia Detection Tool.
The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) is Europe's primary nucleotide sequence archival resource, safeguarding open nucleotide data access, engaging in worldwide collaborative data exchange and integrating with the scientific publication process. ENA has made significant contributions to the collaborative nucleotide archival arena as an active proponent of extending the traditional collaboration to cover capillary and next-generation sequencing information. We have continued to co-develop data and metadata representation formats with our collaborators for both data exchange and public data dissemination. In addition to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank feature table format, we share metadata formats for capillary and next-generation sequencing traces and are using and contributing to the NCBI SRA Toolkit for the long-term storage of the next-generation sequence traces. During the course of 2009, ENA has significantly improved sequence submission, search and access functionalities provided at EMBL–EBI. In this article, we briefly describe the content and scope of our archive and introduce major improvements to our services.
The laboratory mouse is the premier animal model for studying human disease and thousands of mutants have been identified or produced, most recently through gene-specific mutagenesis approaches. High throughput strategies by the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) are producing mutants for all protein coding genes. Generating a knock-out line involves huge monetary and time costs so capture of both the data describing each mutant alongside archiving of the line for distribution to future researchers is critical. The European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA) is a leading international network infrastructure for archiving and worldwide provision of mouse mutant strains. It operates in collaboration with the other members of the Federation of International Mouse Resources (FIMRe), EMMA being the European component. Additionally EMMA is one of four repositories involved in the IKMC, and therefore the current figure of 1700 archived lines will rise markedly. The EMMA database gathers and curates extensive data on each line and presents it through a user-friendly website. A BioMart interface allows advanced searching including integrated querying with other resources e.g. Ensembl. Other resources are able to display EMMA data by accessing our Distributed Annotation System server. EMMA database access is publicly available at http://www.emmanet.org.
Annotating the function of all human genes is a critical, yet formidable, challenge. Current gene annotation efforts focus on centralized curation resources, but it is increasingly clear that this approach does not scale with the rapid growth of the biomedical literature. The Gene Wiki utilizes an alternative and complementary model based on the principle of community intelligence. Directly integrated within the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, the goal of this effort is to build a gene-specific review article for every gene in the human genome, where each article is collaboratively written, continuously updated and community reviewed. Previously, we described the creation of Gene Wiki ‘stubs’ for approximately 9000 human genes. Here, we describe ongoing systematic improvements to these articles to increase their utility. Moreover, we retrospectively examine the community usage and improvement of the Gene Wiki, providing evidence of a critical mass of users and editors. Gene Wiki articles are freely accessible within the Wikipedia web site, and additional links and information are available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Gene_Wiki.
Recent advances allow tracking the levels and locations of a thousand proteins in individual living human cells over time using a library of annotated reporter cell clones (LARC). This library was created by Cohen et al. to study the proteome dynamics of a human lung carcinoma cell-line treated with an anti-cancer drug. Here, we report the Dynamic Proteomics database for the proteins studied by Cohen et al. Each cell-line clone in LARC has a protein tagged with yellow fluorescent protein, expressed from its endogenous chromosomal location, under its natural regulation. The Dynamic Proteomics interface facilitates searches for genes of interest, downloads of protein fluorescent movies and alignments of dynamics following drug addition. Each protein in the database is displayed with its annotation, cDNA sequence, fluorescent images and movies obtained by the time-lapse microscopy. The protein dynamics in the database represents a quantitative trace of the protein fluorescence levels in nucleus and cytoplasm produced by image analysis of movies over time. Furthermore, a sequence analysis provides a search and comparison of up to 50 input DNA sequences with all cDNAs in the library. The raw movies may be useful as a benchmark for developing image analysis tools for individual-cell dynamic-proteomics. The database is available at http://www.dynamicproteomics.net/.
Chromosome translocations and gene fusions are frequent events in the human genome and have been found to cause diverse types of tumor. ChimerDB is a knowledgebase of fusion genes identified from bioinformatics analysis of transcript sequences in the GenBank and various other public resources such as the Sanger cancer genome project (CGP), OMIM, PubMed and the Mitelman's database. In this updated version, we significantly modified the algorithm of identifying fusion transcripts. Specifically, the new algorithm is more sensitive and has detected 2699 fusion transcripts with high confidence. Furthermore, it can identify interchromosomal translocations as well as the intrachromosomal deletions or inversions of large DNA segments. Importantly, results from the analysis of next-generation sequencing data in the short read archives are incorporated as well. We updated and integrated all contents (GenBank, Sanger CGP, OMIM, PubMed publications and the Mitelman's database), and the user-interface has been improved to support diverse types of searches and to enhance the user convenience especially in browsing PubMed articles. We also developed a new alignment viewer that should facilitate examining reliability of fusion transcripts and inferring functional significance. We expect ChimerDB 2.0, available at http://ercsb.ewha.ac.kr/fusiongene, to be a valuable tool in identifying biomarkers and drug targets.
Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) is a freely available dictionary of molecular entities focused on ‘small’ chemical compounds. The molecular entities in question are either natural products or synthetic products used to intervene in the processes of living organisms. Genome-encoded macromolecules (nucleic acids, proteins and peptides derived from proteins by cleavage) are not as a rule included in ChEBI. In addition to molecular entities, ChEBI contains groups (parts of molecular entities) and classes of entities. ChEBI includes an ontological classification, whereby the relationships between molecular entities or classes of entities and their parents and/or children are specified. ChEBI is available online at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/. This article reports on new features in ChEBI since the last NAR report in 2007, including substructure and similarity searching, a submission tool for authoring of ChEBI datasets by the community and a 30-fold increase in the number of chemical structures stored in ChEBI.
DataBase of Transcription Start Sites (DBTSS) is a database which contains precise positional information for transcription start sites (TSSs) of eukaryotic mRNAs. In this update, we included 330 million new tags generated by massively sequencing the 5′-end of oligo-cap selected cDNAs in humans and mice. The tags were collected from normal fetal or adult human tissues, including brain, thymus, liver, kidney and heart, from 6 human cell lines in 21 diverse growth conditions as well as from mouse NIH3T3 cell line: altogether 31 different cell types or culture conditions are represented. This unprecedented increase in depth of data now allows DBTSS to faithfully represent the dynamically changing landscape of TSSs in different cell types and conditions, during development and in the course of evolution. Differential usage of alternative 5′-ends across cell types and conditions can be viewed in a series of new interfaces. Promoter sequence information is now displayed in a comparative genomics viewer where evolutionary turnover of the TSSs can be evaluated. DBTSS can be accessed at http://dbtss.hgc.jp/.
The Network of Cancer Genes (NCG) collects and integrates data on 736 human genes that are mutated in various types of cancer. For each gene, NCG provides information on duplicability, orthology, evolutionary appearance and topological properties of the encoded protein in a comprehensive version of the human protein-protein interaction network. NCG also stores information on all primary interactors of cancer proteins, thus providing a complete overview of 5357 proteins that constitute direct and indirect determinants of human cancer. With the constant delivery of results from the mutational screenings of cancer genomes, NCG represents a versatile resource for retrieving detailed information on particular cancer genes, as well as for identifying common properties of precompiled lists of cancer genes. NCG is freely available at: http://bio.ifom-ieo-campus.it/ncg.
fPOP (footprinting Pockets Of Proteins, http://pocket.uchicago.edu/fpop/) is a relational database of the protein functional surfaces identified by analyzing the shapes of binding sites in ∼42 700 structures, including both holo and apo forms. We previously used a purely geometric method to extract the spatial patterns of functional surfaces (split pockets) in ∼19 000 bound structures and constructed a database, SplitPocket (http://pocket.uchicago.edu/). These functional surfaces are now used as spatial templates to predict the binding surfaces of unbound structures. To conduct a shape comparison, we use the Smith–Waterman algorithm to footprint an unbound pocket fragment with those of the functional surfaces in SplitPocket. The pairwise alignment of the unbound and bound pocket fragments is used to evaluate the local structural similarity via geometric matching. The final results of our large-scale computation, including ∼90 000 identified or predicted functional surfaces, are stored in fPOP. This database provides an easily accessible resource for studying functional surfaces, assessing conformational changes between bound and unbound forms and analyzing functional divergence. Moreover, it may facilitate the exploration of the physicochemical textures of molecules and the inference of protein function. Finally, our approach provides a framework for classification of proteins into families on the basis of their functional surfaces.
The Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/) is actively working with its Worldwide Protein Data Bank partners to enhance the quality and consistency of the international archive of bio-macromolecular structure data, the Protein Data Bank (PDB). PDBe also works closely with its collaborators at the European Bioinformatics Institute and the scientific community around the world to enhance its databases and services by adding curated and actively maintained derived data to the existing structural data in the PDB. We have developed a new database infrastructure based on the remediated PDB archive data and a specially designed database for storing information on interactions between proteins and bound molecules. The group has developed new services that allow users to carry out simple textual queries or more complex 3D structure-based queries. The newly designed ‘PDBeView Atlas pages’ provide an overview of an individual PDB entry in a user-friendly layout and serve as a starting point to further explore the information available in the PDBe database. PDBe's active involvement with the X-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy and cryo-Electron Microscopy communities have resulted in improved tools for structure deposition and analysis.
Microbial enzymes have many known applications as biocatalysts in biotechnology, agriculture, medical and other industries. However, only a few enzymes are currently employed for such commercial applications. In this scenario, the current onslaught of metagenomic data provides a new unexplored treasure trove of genomic wealth that can not only enhance the enzyme repertoire by the discovery of novel commercially useful enzymes (CUEs) but can also reveal better functional variants for existing CUEs. We prepared a catalogue of CUEs using text mining of PubMed abstracts and other publicly available information, and manually curated the data to identify 510 CUEs. Further, in order to identify novel homologues of these CUEs, we identified potential ORFs in publicly available metagenomic datasets from 10 diverse sources. Using this strategy, we have developed a resource called MetaBioME (http://metasystems.riken.jp/metabiome/) that comprises (i) a database of CUEs and (ii) a comprehensive platform to facilitate homology-based computational identification of novel homologous CUEs from metagenomic and bacterial genomic datasets. Using MetaBioME, we have identified several novel homologues to known CUEs that can potentially serve as leads for further experimental verification.
EuPathDB (http://EuPathDB.org; formerly ApiDB) is an integrated database covering the eukaryotic pathogens of the genera Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Leishmania, Neospora, Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Trichomonas and Trypanosoma. While each of these groups is supported by a taxon-specific database built upon the same infrastructure, the EuPathDB portal offers an entry point to all these resources, and the opportunity to leverage orthology for searches across genera. The most recent release of EuPathDB includes updates and changes affecting data content, infrastructure and the user interface, improving data access and enhancing the user experience. EuPathDB currently supports more than 80 searches and the recently-implemented ‘search strategy’ system enables users to construct complex multi-step searches via a graphical interface. Search results are dynamically displayed as the strategy is constructed or modified, and can be downloaded, saved, revised, or shared with other database users.
 GenBank® is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for more than 380 000 organisms named at the genus level or lower, obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects, including whole genome shotgun (WGS) and environmental sampling projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs, and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank staff upon receipt. Daily data exchange with the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through the NCBI Entrez retrieval system that integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. To access GenBank and its related retrieval and analysis services, begin at the NCBI Homepage: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . 
 We describe the Biomolecule Stretching Data Base that has been recently set up at http://www.ifpan.edu.pl/BSDB/ . It provides information about mechanostability of proteins. Its core is based on simulations of stretching of 17 134 proteins within a structure-based model. The primary information is about the heights of the maximal force peaks, the force–displacement patterns, and the sequencing of the contact-rupturing events. We also summarize the possible types of the mechanical clamps, i.e. the motifs which are responsible for a protein's resistance to stretching. 
 Mitochondria constitute complex and flexible cellular entities, which play crucial roles in normal and pathological cell conditions. The database MitoGenesisDB focuses on the dynamic of mitochondrial protein formation through global mRNA analyses. Three main parameters confer a global view of mitochondrial biogenesis: (i) time-course of mRNA production in highly synchronized yeast cell cultures, (ii) microarray analyses of mRNA localization that define translation sites and (iii) mRNA transcription rate and stability which characterize genes that are more dependent on post-transcriptional regulation processes. MitoGenesisDB integrates and establishes cross-comparisons between these data. Several model organisms can be analyzed via orthologous relationships between interspecies genes. More generally this database supports the ‘post-transcriptional operon’ model, which postulates that eukaryotes co-regulate related mRNAs based on their functional organization in ribonucleoprotein complexes. MitoGenesisDB allows identifying such groups of post-trancriptionally regulated genes and is thus a useful tool to analyze the complex relationships between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation processes. The case of respiratory chain assembly factors illustrates this point. The MitoGenesisDB interface is available at http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/mitgene/ . 
 KUPS (The University of Kansas Proteomics Service) provides high-quality protein–protein interaction (PPI) data for researchers developing and evaluating computational models for predicting PPIs by allowing users to construct ready-to-use data sets of interacting protein pairs (IPPs), non-interacting protein pairs (NIPs) and associated features. Multiple filters and options allow the user to control the make-up of the IPPs and NIPs as well as the quality of the resultant data sets. Each data set is built from the overall database, which includes 185 446 IPPs and ∼1.5 billion NIPs from five primary databases: IntAct, HPRD, MINT, UniProt and the Gene Ontology. The IPP set can be set to specific model organisms, interaction types and experimental evidence. The NIP set can be generated using four different strategies, which can alleviate biased estimation problems. Lastly, multiple features can be provided for all of the IPP and NIP pairs. Additionally, KUPS provides two benchmark data sets to help researchers compare their algorithms to existing approaches. KUPS is freely available at http://www.ittc.ku.edu/chenlab . 
 A decade ago, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was established at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The original objective of GEO was to serve as a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data generated mostly by microarray technology. However, the research community quickly applied microarrays to non-gene-expression studies, including examination of genome copy number variation and genome-wide profiling of DNA-binding proteins. Because the GEO database was designed with a flexible structure, it was possible to quickly adapt the repository to store these data types. More recently, as the microarray community switches to next-generation sequencing technologies, GEO has again adapted to host these data sets. Today, GEO stores over 20 000 microarray- and sequence-based functional genomics studies, and continues to handle the majority of direct high-throughput data submissions from the research community. Multiple mechanisms are provided to help users effectively search, browse, download and visualize the data at the level of individual genes or entire studies. This paper describes recent database enhancements, including new search and data representation tools, as well as a brief review of how the community uses GEO data. GEO is freely accessible at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ . 
 The Open Protein Structure Annotation Network (TOPSAN) is a web-based collaboration platform for exploring and annotating structures determined by structural genomics efforts. Characterization of those structures presents a challenge since the majority of the proteins themselves have not yet been characterized. Responding to this challenge, the TOPSAN platform facilitates collaborative annotation and investigation via a user-friendly web-based interface pre-populated with automatically generated information. Semantic web technologies expand and enrich TOPSAN’s content through links to larger sets of related databases, and thus, enable data integration from disparate sources and data mining via conventional query languages. TOPSAN can be found at http://www.topsan.org . 
 GlycomeDB integrates the structural and taxonomic data of all major public carbohydrate databases, as well as carbohydrates contained in the Protein Data Bank, which renders the database currently the most comprehensive and unified resource for carbohydrate structures worldwide. GlycomeDB retains the links to the original databases and is updated at weekly intervals with the newest structures available from the source databases. The complete database can be downloaded freely or accessed through a Web-interface ( www.glycome-db.org ) that provides flexible and powerful search functionalities. 
 The Laminin(LM)-database, hosted at http://www.lm.lncc.br , is the first database focusing a non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein family, the LMs. Part of the knowledge available in this website is automatically retrieved, whereas a significant amount of information is curated and annotated, thus placing LM-database beyond a simple repository of data. In its home page, an overview of the rationale for the database is seen and readers can access a tutorial to facilitate navigation in the website, which in turn is presented with tabs subdivided into LMs, receptors, extracellular binding and other related proteins. Each tab opens into a given LM or LM-related molecule, where the reader finds a series of further tabs for ‘protein’, ‘gene structure’, ‘gene expression’ and ‘tissue distribution’ and ‘therapy’. Data are separated as a function of species, comprising Homo sapiens , Mus musculus and Rattus novergicus . Furthermore, there is specific tab displaying the LM nomenclatures. In another tab, a direct link to PubMed, which can be then consulted in a specific way, in terms of the biological functions of each molecule, knockout animals and genetic diseases, immune response and lymphomas/leukemias. LM-database will hopefully be a relevant tool for retrieving information concerning LMs in health and disease, particularly regarding the hemopoietic system. 
 The predicted Arabidopsis interactome resource (PAIR, http://www.cls.zju.edu.cn/pair/ ), comprised of 5990 experimentally reported molecular interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana together with 145 494 predicted interactions, is currently the most comprehensive data set of the Arabidopsis interactome with high reliability. PAIR predicts interactions by a fine-tuned support vector machine model that integrates indirect evidences for interaction, such as gene co-expressions, domain interactions, shared GO annotations, co-localizations, phylogenetic profile similarities and homologous interactions in other organisms (interologs). These predictions were expected to cover 24% of the entire Arabidopsis interactome, and their reliability was estimated to be 44%. Two independent example data sets were used to rigorously validate the prediction accuracy. PAIR features a user-friendly query interface, providing rich annotation on the relationships between two proteins. A graphical interaction network browser has also been integrated into the PAIR web interface to facilitate mining of specific pathways. 
 The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) aims to assign a unique gene symbol and name to every human gene. The HGNC database currently contains almost 30 000 approved gene symbols, over 19 000 of which represent protein-coding genes. The public website, www.genenames.org , displays all approved nomenclature within Symbol Reports that contain data curated by HGNC editors and links to related genomic, phenotypic and proteomic information. Here we describe improvements to our resources, including a new Quick Gene Search, a new List Search, an integrated HGNC BioMart and a new Statistics and Downloads facility. 
 RNA helicases are ubiquitous and essential enzymes that function in nearly all aspects of RNA metabolism. The RNA helicase database ( www.rnahelicase.org ) integrates the wealth of accumulating information on RNA helicases in a readily accessible format. The database is a portal that allows straightforward retrieval of comprehensive information on sequence, structure and on biochemical and cellular functions of all RNA helicases from the most widely used model organisms Escherichia coli , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila melanogaster , mouse and human. Also included are RNA helicases from other organisms that are subject to specific investigation. The database is structured according to the most recent helicase classification into helicase superfamilies (SFs) and families, and thus emphasizes phyologenetic relations between RNA helicases as well. Information on individual RNA helicases can be accessed through various browsing routes or through text-based searches of the database. 
 Publicly available databases of coexpressed gene sets are a valuable resource for a wide variety of experimental studies, including gene targeting for functional identification, and for investigations of regulatory mechanisms or protein–protein interaction networks. Although coexpressed gene databases are becoming more and more popular in the field of plant biology, those with animal data are rather limited, possibly due to the lower reliability of the coexpression data. The original COXPRESdb (coexpressed gene database) ( http://coxpresdb.jp ) represented the coexpression relationship for human and mouse. Here, we report updates of this database that especially focus on the enhancement of the reliability of gene coexpression data in animals. For this purpose, we implemented a new comparable coexpression measure, Mutual Rank, included five other animal species, rat, chicken, zebrafish, fly and nematoda, to assess the conservation of coexpression, and added different layers of omics data into the integrated network of genes. Comparison of coexpression is a key concept to enhance the reliability of gene coexpression, and the integration of different information can reduce the noise inherent in the information. With the functions for gene network representation, COXPRESdb can help researchers to clarify the functional and regulatory networks of genes in a broad array of animal species. 
 The SUPERFAMILY resource provides protein domain assignments at the structural classification of protein (SCOP) superfamily level for over 1400 completely sequenced genomes, over 120 metagenomes and other gene collections such as UniProt. All models and assignments are available to browse and download at http://supfam.org . A new hidden Markov model library based on SCOP 1.75 has been created and a previously ignored class of SCOP, coiled coils, is now included. Our scoring component now uses HMMER3, which is in orders of magnitude faster and produces superior results. A cloud-based pipeline was implemented and is publicly available at Amazon web services elastic computer cloud. The SUPERFAMILY reference tree of life has been improved allowing the user to highlight a chosen superfamily, family or domain architecture on the tree of life. The most significant advance in SUPERFAMILY is that now it contains a domain-based gene ontology (GO) at the superfamily and family levels. A new methodology was developed to ensure a high quality GO annotation. The new methodology is general purpose and has been used to produce domain-based phenotypic ontologies in addition to GO. 
 ParameciumDB is a community model organism database built with the GMOD toolkit to integrate the genome and biology of the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia . Over the last four years, post-genomic data from proteome and transcriptome studies has been incorporated along with predicted orthologs in 33 species, annotations from the community and publications from the scientific literature. Available tools include BioMart for complex queries, GBrowse2 for genome browsing, the Apollo genome editor for expert curation of gene models, a Blast server, a motif finder, and a wiki for protocols, nomenclature guidelines and other documentation. In-house tools have been developed for ontology browsing and evaluation of off-target RNAi matches. Now ready for next-generation deep sequencing data and the genomes of other Paramecium species, this open-access resource is available at http://paramecium.cgm.cnrs-gif.fr . 
 Cell line identification is emerging as an essential method for every cell line user in research community to avoid using misidentified cell lines for experiments and publications. IGRhCellID ( http://igrcid.ibms.sinica.edu.tw ) is designed to integrate eight cell identification methods including seven methods (STR profile, gender, immunotypes, karyotype, isoenzyme profile, TP53 mutation and mutations of cancer genes) available in various public databases and our method of profiling genome alterations of human cell lines. With data validation of 11 small deleted genes in human cancer cell lines, profiles of genomic alterations further allow users to search for human cell lines with deleted gene to serve as indigenous knock-out cell model (such as SMAD4 in gene view), with amplified gene to be the cell models for testing therapeutic efficacy (such as ERBB2 in gene view) and with overlapped aberrant chromosomal loci for revealing common cancer genes (such as 9p21.3 homozygous deletion with co-deleted CDKN2A , CDKN2B and MTAP in chromosome view). IGRhCellID provides not only available methods for cell identification to help eradicating concerns of using misidentified cells but also designated genetic features of human cell lines for experiments. 
 The rapid accumulation of knowledge on biological signaling pathways and their regulatory mechanisms has highlighted the need for specific repositories that can store, organize and allow retrieval of pathway information in a way that will be useful for the research community. SPIKE (Signaling Pathways Integrated Knowledge Engine; http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/&~spike/ ) is a database for achieving this goal, containing highly curated interactions for particular human pathways, along with literature-referenced information on the nature of each interaction. To make database population and pathway comprehension straightforward, a simple yet informative data model is used, and pathways are laid out as maps that reflect the curator&rsquo;s understanding and make the utilization of the pathways easy. The database currently focuses primarily on pathways describing DNA damage response, cell cycle, programmed cell death and hearing related pathways. Pathways are regularly updated, and additional pathways are gradually added. The complete database and the individual maps are freely exportable in several formats. The database is accompanied by a stand-alone software tool for analysis and dynamic visualization of pathways. 
 Allostery is the most direct, rapid and efficient way of regulating protein function, ranging from the control of metabolic mechanisms to signal-transduction pathways. However, an enormous amount of unsystematic allostery information has deterred scientists who could benefit from this field. Here, we present the AlloSteric Database (ASD), the first online database that provides a central resource for the display, search and analysis of structure, function and related annotation for allosteric molecules. Currently, ASD contains 336 allosteric proteins from 101 species and 8095 modulators in three categories (activators, inhibitors and regulators). Proteins are annotated with a detailed description of allostery, biological process and related diseases, and modulators with binding affinity, physicochemical properties and therapeutic area. Integrating the information of allosteric proteins in ASD should allow for the identification of specific allosteric sites of a given subtype among proteins of the same family that can potentially serve as ideal targets for experimental validation. In addition, modulators curated in ASD can be used to investigate potent allosteric targets for the query compound, and also help chemists to implement structure modifications for novel allosteric drug design. Therefore, ASD could be a platform and a starting point for biologists and medicinal chemists for furthering allosteric research. ASD is freely available at http://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/ASD/ . 
 Protein interactions are involved in important cellular functions and biological processes that are the fundamentals of all life activities. With improvements in experimental techniques and progress in research, the overall protein interaction network frameworks of several model organisms have been created through data collection and integration. However, most of the networks processed only show simple relationships without boundary, weight or direction, which do not truly reflect the biological reality. In vivo , different types of protein interactions, such as the assembly of protein complexes or phosphorylation, often have their specific functions and qualifications. Ignorance of these features will bring much bias to the network analysis and application. Therefore, we annotate the Arabidopsis proteins in the AtPID database with further information (e.g. functional annotation, subcellular localization, tissue-specific expression, phosphorylation information, SNP phenotype and mutant phenotype, etc.) and interaction qualifications (e.g. transcriptional regulation, complex assembly, functional collaboration, etc.) via further literature text mining and integration of other resources. Meanwhile, the related information is vividly displayed to users through a comprehensive and newly developed display and analytical tools. The system allows the construction of tissue-specific interaction networks with display of canonical pathways. The latest updated AtPID database is available at http://www.megabionet.org/atpid/ . 
 DrugBank ( http://www.drugbank.ca ) is a richly annotated database of drug and drug target information. It contains extensive data on the nomenclature, ontology, chemistry, structure, function, action, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, metabolism and pharmaceutical properties of both small molecule and large molecule (biotech) drugs. It also contains comprehensive information on the target diseases, proteins, genes and organisms on which these drugs act. First released in 2006, DrugBank has become widely used by pharmacists, medicinal chemists, pharmaceutical researchers, clinicians, educators and the general public. Since its last update in 2008, DrugBank has been greatly expanded through the addition of new drugs, new targets and the inclusion of more than 40 new data fields per drug entry (a 40% increase in data ‘depth’). These data field additions include illustrated drug-action pathways, drug transporter data, drug metabolite data, pharmacogenomic data, adverse drug response data, ADMET data, pharmacokinetic data, computed property data and chemical classification data. DrugBank 3.0 also offers expanded database links, improved search tools for drug–drug and food–drug interaction, new resources for querying and viewing drug pathways and hundreds of new drug entries with detailed patent, pricing and manufacturer data. These additions have been complemented by enhancements to the quality and quantity of existing data, particularly with regard to drug target, drug description and drug action data. DrugBank 3.0 represents the result of 2 years of manual annotation work aimed at making the database much more useful for a wide range of ‘omics’ (i.e. pharmacogenomic, pharmacoproteomic, pharmacometabolomic and even pharmacoeconomic) applications. 
 UK PubMed Central (UKPMC) is a full-text article database that extends the functionality of the original PubMed Central (PMC) repository. The UKPMC project was launched as the first ‘mirror’ site to PMC, which in analogy to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, aims to provide international preservation of the open and free-access biomedical literature. UKPMC ( http://ukpmc.ac.uk ) has undergone considerable development since its inception in 2007 and now includes both a UKPMC and PubMed search, as well as access to other records such as Agricola, Patents and recent biomedical theses. UKPMC also differs from PubMed/PMC in that the full text and abstract information can be searched in an integrated manner from one input box. Furthermore, UKPMC contains ‘Cited By’ information as an alternative way to navigate the literature and has incorporated text-mining approaches to semantically enrich content and integrate it with related database resources. Finally, UKPMC also offers added-value services (UKPMC+) that enable grantees to deposit manuscripts, link papers to grants, publish online portfolios and view citation information on their papers. Here we describe UKPMC and clarify the relationship between PMC and UKPMC, providing historical context and future directions, 10 years on from when PMC was first launched. 
 Reactome ( http://www.reactome.org ) is a collaboration among groups at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York University School of Medicine and The European Bioinformatics Institute, to develop an open source curated bioinformatics database of human pathways and reactions. Recently, we developed a new web site with improved tools for pathway browsing and data analysis. The Pathway Browser is an Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)-based visualization system that supports zooming, scrolling and event highlighting. It exploits PSIQUIC web services to overlay our curated pathways with molecular interaction data from the Reactome Functional Interaction Network and external interaction databases such as IntAct, BioGRID, ChEMBL, iRefIndex, MINT and STRING. Our Pathway and Expression Analysis tools enable ID mapping, pathway assignment and overrepresentation analysis of user-supplied data sets. To support pathway annotation and analysis in other species, we continue to make orthology-based inferences of pathways in non-human species, applying Ensembl Compara to identify orthologs of curated human proteins in each of 20 other species. The resulting inferred pathway sets can be browsed and analyzed with our Species Comparison tool. Collaborations are also underway to create manually curated data sets on the Reactome framework for chicken, Drosophila and rice. 
 MatrixDB ( http://matrixdb.ibcp.fr ) is a freely available database focused on interactions established by extracellular proteins and polysaccharides. Only few databases report protein–polysaccharide interactions and, to the best of our knowledge, there is no other database of extracellular interactions. MatrixDB takes into account the multimeric nature of several extracellular protein families for the curation of interactions, and reports interactions with individual polypeptide chains or with multimers, considered as permanent complexes, when appropriate. MatrixDB is a member of the International Molecular Exchange consortium (IMEx) and has adopted the PSI-MI standards for the curation and the exchange of interaction data. MatrixDB stores experimental data from our laboratory, data from literature curation, data imported from IMEx databases, and data from the Human Protein Reference Database. MatrixDB is focused on mammalian interactions, but aims to integrate interaction datasets of model organisms when available. MatrixDB provides direct links to databases recapitulating mutations in genes encoding extracellular proteins, to UniGene and to the Human Protein Atlas that shows expression and localization of proteins in a large variety of normal human tissues and cells. MatrixDB allows researchers to perform customized queries and to build tissue- and disease-specific interaction networks that can be visualized and analyzed with Cytoscape or Medusa. 
 IEDB-3D is the 3D structural component of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) available via the ‘Browse by 3D Structure’ page at http://www.iedb.org . IEDB-3D catalogs B- and T-cell epitopes and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) ligands for which 3D structures of complexes with antibodies, T-cell receptors or MHC molecules are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Journal articles that are primary citations of PDB structures and that define immune epitopes are curated within IEDB as any other reference along with accompanying functional assays and immunologically relevant information. For each curated structure, IEDB-3D provides calculated data on intermolecular contacts and interface areas and includes an application, EpitopeViewer, to visualize the structures. IEDB-3D is fully embedded within IEDB, thus allowing structural data, both curated and calculated, and all accompanying information to be queried using multiple search interfaces. These include queries for epitopes recognized in different pathogens, eliciting different functional immune responses, and recognized by different components of the immune system. The query results can be downloaded in Microsoft Excel format, or the entire database, together with structural data both curated and calculated, can be downloaded in either XML or MySQL formats. 
 The protein common interface database (ProtCID) is a database that contains clusters of similar homodimeric and heterodimeric interfaces observed in multiple crystal forms (CFs). Such interfaces, especially of homologous but non-identical proteins, have been associated with biologically relevant interactions. In ProtCID, protein chains in the protein data bank (PDB) are grouped based on their PFAM domain architectures. For a single PFAM architecture, all the dimers present in each CF are constructed and compared with those in other CFs that contain the same domain architecture. Interfaces occurring in two or more CFs comprise an interface cluster in the database. The same process is used to compare heterodimers of chains with different domain architectures. By examining interfaces that are shared by many homologous proteins in different CFs, we find that the PDB and the Protein Interfaces, Surfaces, and Assemblies (PISA) are not always consistent in their annotations of biological assemblies in a homologous family. Our data therefore provide an independent check on publicly available annotations of the structures of biological interactions for PDB entries. Common interfaces may also be useful in studies of protein evolution. Coordinates for all interfaces in a cluster are downloadable for further analysis. ProtCiD is available at http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/protcid . 
 The database of three-dimensional interacting domains (3did) is a collection of protein interactions for which high-resolution three-dimensional structures are known. 3did exploits the availability of structural data to provide molecular details on interactions between two globular domains as well as novel domain–peptide interactions, derived using a recently published method from our lab. The interface residues are presented for each interaction type individually, plus global domain interfaces at which one or more partners (domains or peptides) bind. The 3did web server at http://3did.irbbarcelona.org visualizes these interfaces along with atomic details of individual interactions using Jmol. The complete contents are also available for download. 
 ArachnoServer ( www.arachnoserver.org ) is a manually curated database providing information on the sequence, structure and biological activity of protein toxins from spider venoms. These proteins are of interest to a wide range of biologists due to their diverse applications in medicine, neuroscience, pharmacology, drug discovery and agriculture. ArachnoServer currently manages 1078 protein sequences, 759 nucleic acid sequences and 56 protein structures. Key features of ArachnoServer include a molecular target ontology designed specifically for venom toxins, current and historic taxonomic information and a powerful advanced search interface. The following significant improvements have been implemented in version 2.0: (i) the average and monoisotopic molecular masses of both the reduced and oxidized form of each mature toxin are provided; (ii) the advanced search feature now enables searches on the basis of toxin mass, external database accession numbers and publication date in ArachnoServer; (iii) toxins can now be browsed on the basis of their phyletic specificity; (iv) rapid BLAST searches based on the mature toxin sequence can be performed directly from the toxin card; (v) private silos can be requested from research groups engaged in venoms-based research, enabling them to easily manage and securely store data during the process of toxin discovery; and (vi) a detailed user manual is now available. 
 We describe IsoBase, a database identifying functionally related proteins, across five major eukaryotic model organisms: Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Drosophila melanogaster , Caenorhabditis elegans , Mus musculus and Homo Sapiens. Nearly all existing algorithms for orthology detection are based on sequence comparison. Although these have been successful in orthology prediction to some extent, we seek to go beyond these methods by the integration of sequence data and protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks to help in identifying true functionally related proteins. With that motivation, we introduce IsoBase, the first publicly available ortholog database that focuses on functionally related proteins. The groupings were computed using the IsoRankN algorithm that uses spectral methods to combine sequence and PPI data and produce clusters of functionally related proteins. These clusters compare favorably with those from existing approaches: proteins within an IsoBase cluster are more likely to share similar Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. A total of 48 120 proteins were clustered into 12 693 functionally related groups. The IsoBase database may be browsed for functionally related proteins across two or more species and may also be queried by accession numbers, species-specific identifiers, gene name or keyword. The database is freely available for download at http://isobase.csail.mit.edu/ . 
 The Sol Genomics Network (SGN; http://solgenomics.net/ ) is a clade-oriented database (COD) containing biological data for species in the Solanaceae and their close relatives, with data types ranging from chromosomes and genes to phenotypes and accessions. SGN hosts several genome maps and sequences, including a pre-release of the tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum cv Heinz 1706) reference genome. A new transcriptome component has been added to store RNA-seq and microarray data. SGN is also an open source software project, continuously developing and improving a complex system for storing, integrating and analyzing data. All code and development work is publicly visible on GitHub ( http://github.com ). The database architecture combines SGN-specific schemas and the community-developed Chado schema ( http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado ) for compatibility with other genome databases. The SGN curation model is community-driven, allowing researchers to add and edit information using simple web tools. Currently, over a hundred community annotators help curate the database. SGN can be accessed at http://solgenomics.net/ . 
 The combination of significantly lower cost and increased speed of sequencing has resulted in an explosive growth of data submitted into the primary next-generation sequence data archive, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The preservation of experimental data is an important part of the scientific record, and increasing numbers of journals and funding agencies require that next-generation sequence data are deposited into the SRA. The SRA was established as a public repository for the next-generation sequence data and is operated by the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). INSDC partners include the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). The SRA is accessible at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra from NCBI, at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena from EBI and at http://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp from DDBJ. In this article, we present the content and structure of the SRA, detail our support for sequencing platforms and provide recommended data submission levels and formats. We also briefly outline our response to the challenge of data growth. 
 The IUPHAR database is an established online reference resource for several important classes of human drug targets and related proteins. As well as providing recommended nomenclature, the database integrates information on the chemical, genetic, functional and pathophysiological properties of receptors and ion channels, curated and peer-reviewed from the biomedical literature by a network of experts. The database now includes information on 616 gene products from four superfamilies in human and rodent model organisms: G protein-coupled receptors, voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and, in a recent update, 49 nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs). New data types for NHRs include details on co-regulators, DNA binding motifs, target genes and 3D structures. Other recent developments include curation of the chemical structures of approximately 2000 ligand molecules, providing electronic descriptors, identifiers, link-outs and calculated molecular properties, all available via enhanced ligand pages. The interface now provides intelligent tools for the visualization and exploration of ligand structure-activity relationships and the structural diversity of compounds active at each target. The database is freely available at http://www.iuphar-db.org . 
 Although the capability of DNA to form a variety of non-canonical (non-B) structures has long been recognized, the overall significance of these alternate conformations in biology has only recently become accepted en masse . In order to provide access to genome-wide locations of these classes of predicted structures, we have developed non-B DB, a database integrating annotations and analysis of non-B DNA-forming sequence motifs. The database provides the most complete list of alternative DNA structure predictions available, including Z-DNA motifs, quadruplex-forming motifs, inverted repeats, mirror repeats and direct repeats and their associated subsets of cruciforms, triplex and slipped structures, respectively. The database also contains motifs predicted to form static DNA bends, short tandem repeats and homo(purine•pyrimidine) tracts that have been associated with disease. The database has been built using the latest releases of the human, chimp, dog, macaque and mouse genomes, so that the results can be compared directly with other data sources. In order to make the data interpretable in a genomic context, features such as genes, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and repetitive elements (SINE, LINE, etc.) have also been incorporated. The database is accessed through query pages that produce results with links to the UCSC browser and a GBrowse-based genomic viewer. It is freely accessible at http://nonb.abcc.ncifcrf.gov . 
 Various databases have harnessed the wealth of publicly available microarray data to address biological questions ranging from across-tissue differential expression to homologous gene expression. Despite their practical value, these databases rely on relative measures of expression and are unable to address the most fundamental question—which genes are expressed in a given cell type. The Gene Expression Barcode is the first database to provide reliable absolute measures of expression for most annotated genes for 131 human and 89 mouse tissue types, including diseased tissue. This is made possible by a novel algorithm that leverages information from the GEO and ArrayExpress public repositories to build statistical models that permit converting data from a single microarray into expressed/unexpressed calls for each gene. For selected platforms, users may upload data and obtain results in a matter of seconds. The raw data, curated annotation, and code used to create our resource are also available at http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/barcode . 
 The fungal genus Fusarium includes many plant and/or animal pathogenic species and produces diverse toxins. Although accurate species identification is critical for managing such threats, it is difficult to identify Fusarium morphologically. Fortunately, extensive molecular phylogenetic studies, founded on well-preserved culture collections, have established a robust foundation for Fusarium classification. Genomes of four Fusarium species have been published with more being currently sequenced. The Cyber infrastructure for Fusarium (CiF; http://www.fusariumdb.org/ ) was built to support archiving and utilization of rapidly increasing data and knowledge and consists of Fusarium-ID, Fusarium Comparative Genomics Platform (FCGP) and Fusarium Community Platform (FCP). The Fusarium-ID archives phylogenetic marker sequences from most known species along with information associated with characterized isolates and supports strain identification and phylogenetic analyses. The FCGP currently archives five genomes from four species. Besides supporting genome browsing and analysis, the FCGP presents computed characteristics of multiple gene families and functional groups. The Cart/Favorite function allows users to collect sequences from Fusarium-ID and the FCGP and analyze them later using multiple tools without requiring repeated copying-and-pasting of sequences. The FCP is designed to serve as an online community forum for sharing and preserving accumulated experience and knowledge to support future research and education. 
 NCBI’s Conserved Domain Database (CDD) is a resource for the annotation of protein sequences with the location of conserved domain footprints, and functional sites inferred from these footprints. CDD includes manually curated domain models that make use of protein 3D structure to refine domain models and provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships. Manually curated models are organized hierarchically if they describe domain families that are clearly related by common descent. As CDD also imports domain family models from a variety of external sources, it is a partially redundant collection. To simplify protein annotation, redundant models and models describing homologous families are clustered into superfamilies. By default, domain footprints are annotated with the corresponding superfamily designation, on top of which specific annotation may indicate high-confidence assignment of family membership. Pre-computed domain annotation is available for proteins in the Entrez/Protein dataset, and a novel interface, Batch CD-Search, allows the computation and download of annotation for large sets of protein queries. CDD can be accessed via http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml . 
 P2CS ( http://www.p2cs.org ) is a specialized database for prokaryotic two-component systems (TCSs), virtually ubiquitous signalling proteins which regulate a wide range of physiological processes. The primary aim of the database is to annotate and classify TCS proteins from completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes and metagenomes. Information within P2CS can be accessed through a variety of routes—TCS complements can be browsed by metagenome, replicon or sequence cluster (and these genesets are available for download by users). Alternatively a variety of database-wide or taxon-specific searches are supported. Each TCS protein is fully annotated with sequence-feature information including replicon context, while properties of the predicted proteins can be queried against several external prediction servers to suggest homologues, interaction networks, sub-cellular localization and domain complements. Another unique feature of P2CS is the analysis of ORFeomes to identify TCS genes missed during genome annotation. Recent innovations for P2CS include a CGView representation of the distribution of TCS genes around a replicon, categorization of TCS genes based on gene organization, an expanded domain-based classification scheme, a P2CS ‘gene cart’ and categorization on the basis of sequence clusters. 
 OMA (Orthologous MAtrix) is a database that identifies orthologs among publicly available, complete genomes. Initiated in 2004, the project is at its 11th release. It now includes 1000 genomes, making it one of the largest resources of its kind. Here, we describe recent developments in terms of species covered; the algorithmic pipeline—in particular regarding the treatment of alternative splicing, and new features of the web (OMA Browser) and programming interface (SOAP API). In the second part, we review the various representations provided by OMA and their typical applications. The database is publicly accessible at http://omabrowser.org . 
 Full-Parasites ( http://fullmal.hgc.jp/ ) is a transcriptome database of apicomplexa parasites, which include Plasmodium and Toxoplasma species. The latest version of Full-Parasites contains a total of 105 786 EST sequences from 12 parasites, of which 5925 full-length cDNAs have been completely sequenced. Full-Parasites also contain more than 30 million transcription start sites (TSS) for Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Toxoplasma gondii (Tg), which were identified using our novel oligo-capping-based protocol. Various types of cDNA data resources were interconnected with our original database functionalities. Specifically, in this update, we have included two unique RNA-Seq data sets consisting of 730 million mapped RNA-Seq tags. One is a dataset of 16 time-lapse experiments of cultured bradyzoite differentiation for Tg. The other dataset includes 31 clinical samples of Pf. Parasite RNA was extracted together with host human RNA, and the extracted mixed RNA was used for RNA sequencing, with the expectation that gene expression information from the host and parasite would be simultaneously represented. By providing the largest unique full-length cDNA and dynamic transcriptome data, Full-Parasites is useful for understanding host–parasite interactions and will help to eventually elucidate how monophyletic organisms have evolved to become parasites by adopting complex life cycles. 
As a reversible post-translational modification (PTM) discovered decades ago, protein lysine acetylation was known for its regulation of transcription through the modification of histones. Recent studies discovered that lysine acetylation targets broad substrates and especially plays an essential role in cellular metabolic regulation. Although acetylation is comparable with other major PTMs such as phosphorylation, an integrated resource still remains to be developed. In this work, we presented the compendium of protein lysine acetylation (CPLA) database for lysine acetylated substrates with their sites. From the scientific literature, we manually collected 7151 experimentally identified acetylation sites in 3311 targets. We statistically studied the regulatory roles of lysine acetylation by analyzing the Gene Ontology (GO) and InterPro annotations. Combined with protein–protein interaction information, we systematically discovered a potential human lysine acetylation network (HLAN) among histone acetyltransferases (HATs), substrates and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In particular, there are 1862 triplet relationships of HAT-substrate-HDAC retrieved from the HLAN, at least 13 of which were previously experimentally verified. The online services of CPLA database was implemented in PHP + MySQL + JavaScript, while the local packages were developed in JAVA 1.5 (J2SE 5.0). The CPLA database is freely available for all users at: http://cpla.biocuckoo.org.
 MicroRNAs (miRNAs), i.e. small non-coding RNA molecules (∼22 nt), can bind to one or more target sites on a gene transcript to negatively regulate protein expression, subsequently controlling many cellular mechanisms. A current and curated collection of miRNA–target interactions (MTIs) with experimental support is essential to thoroughly elucidating miRNA functions under different conditions and in different species. As a database, miRTarBase has accumulated more than 3500 MTIs by manually surveying pertinent literature after data mining of the text systematically to filter research articles related to functional studies of miRNAs. Generally, the collected MTIs are validated experimentally by reporter assays, western blot, or microarray experiments with overexpression or knockdown of miRNAs. miRTarBase curates 3576 experimentally verified MTIs between 657 miRNAs and 2297 target genes among 17 species. miRTarBase contains the largest amount of validated MTIs by comparing with other similar, previously developed databases. The MTIs collected in the miRTarBase can also provide a large amount of positive samples to develop computational methods capable of identifying miRNA–target interactions. miRTarBase is now available on http://miRTarBase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/ , and is updated frequently by continuously surveying research articles. 
 Under the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC; http://www.insdc.org ), globally comprehensive public domain nucleotide sequence is captured, preserved and presented. The partners of this long-standing collaboration work closely together to provide data formats and conventions that enable consistent data submission to their databases and support regular data exchange around the globe. Clearly defined policy and governance in relation to free access to data and relationships with journal publishers have positioned INSDC databases as a key provider of the scientific record and a core foundation for the global bioinformatics data infrastructure. While growth in sequence data volumes comes no longer as a surprise to INSDC partners, the uptake of next-generation sequencing technology by mainstream science that we have witnessed in recent years brings a step-change to growth, necessarily making a clear mark on INSDC strategy. In this article, we introduce the INSDC, outline data growth patterns and comment on the challenges of increased growth. 
 α-Helical transmembrane (TM) proteins play an important role in many critical and diverse biological processes, and specific associations between TM helices are important determinants for membrane protein folding, dynamics and function. In order to gain insights into the above phenomena, it is necessary to investigate different types of helix-packing modes and interactions. However, such information is difficult to obtain because of the experimental impediment and a lack of a well-annotated source of helix-packing folds in TM proteins. We have developed the TMPad ( T rans M embrane Protein Helix- Pa cking D atabase) which addresses the above issues by integrating experimentally observed helix–helix interactions and related structural information of membrane proteins. Specifically, the TMPad offers pre-calculated geometric descriptors at the helix-packing interface including residue backbone/side-chain contacts, interhelical distances and crossing angles, helical translational shifts and rotational angles. The TMPad also includes the corresponding sequence, topology, lipid accessibility, ligand-binding information and supports structural classification, schematic diagrams and visualization of the above structural features of TM helix-packing. Through detailed annotations and visualizations of helix-packing, this online resource can serve as an information gateway for deciphering the relationship between helix–helix interactions and higher levels of organization in TM protein structure and function. The website of the TMPad is freely accessible to the public at http://bio-cluster.iis.sinica.edu.tw/TMPad . 
 Pathway Commons ( http://www.pathwaycommons.org ) is a collection of publicly available pathway data from multiple organisms. Pathway Commons provides a web-based interface that enables biologists to browse and search a comprehensive collection of pathways from multiple sources represented in a common language, a download site that provides integrated bulk sets of pathway information in standard or convenient formats and a web service that software developers can use to conveniently query and access all data. Database providers can share their pathway data via a common repository. Pathways include biochemical reactions, complex assembly, transport and catalysis events and physical interactions involving proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules and complexes. Pathway Commons aims to collect and integrate all public pathway data available in standard formats. Pathway Commons currently contains data from nine databases with over 1400 pathways and 687 000 interactions and will be continually expanded and updated. 
 GreenPhylDB is a database designed for comparative and functional genomics based on complete genomes. Version 2 now contains sixteen full genomes of members of the plantae kingdom, ranging from algae to angiosperms, automatically clustered into gene families. Gene families are manually annotated and then analyzed phylogenetically in order to elucidate orthologous and paralogous relationships. The database offers various lists of gene families including plant, phylum and species specific gene families. For each gene cluster or gene family, easy access to gene composition, protein domains, publications, external links and orthologous gene predictions is provided. Web interfaces have been further developed to improve the navigation through information related to gene families. New analysis tools are also available, such as a gene family ontology browser that facilitates exploration. GreenPhylDB is a component of the South Green Bioinformatics Platform ( http://southgreen.cirad.fr/ ) and is accessible at http://greenphyl.cirad.fr . It enables comparative genomics in a broad taxonomy context to enhance the understanding of evolutionary processes and thus tends to speed up gene discovery. 
 The current 18th Database Issue of Nucleic Acids Research features descriptions of 96 new and 83 updated online databases covering various areas of molecular biology. It includes two editorials, one that discusses COMBREX, a new exciting project aimed at figuring out the functions of the ‘conserved hypothetical’ proteins, and one concerning BioDBcore, a proposed description of the ‘minimal information about a biological database’. Papers from the members of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database collaboration (INSDC) describe each of the participating databases, DDBJ, ENA and GenBank, principles of data exchange within the collaboration, and the recently established Sequence Read Archive. A testament to the longevity of databases, this issue includes updates on the RNA modification database, Definition of Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) and Homology-derived Secondary Structure of Proteins (HSSP) databases, which have not been featured here in >12 years. There is also a block of papers describing recent progress in protein structure databases, such as Protein DataBank (PDB), PDB in Europe (PDBe), CATH, SUPERFAMILY and others, as well as databases on protein structure modeling, protein–protein interactions and the organization of inter-protein contact sites. Other highlights include updates of the popular gene expression databases, GEO and ArrayExpress, several cancer gene databases and a detailed description of the UK PubMed Central project. The Nucleic Acids Research online Database Collection, available at: http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/a/ , now lists 1330 carefully selected molecular biology databases. The full content of the Database Issue is freely available online at the Nucleic Acids Research web site ( http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/ ). 
 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) together with bisulphite conversion allows the generation of whole genome methylation maps at single-cytosine resolution. This allows studying the absence of methylation in a particular genome region over a range of tissues, the differential tissue methylation or the changes occurring along pathological conditions. However, no database exists fully addressing such requirements. We propose here NGSmethDB ( http://bioinfo2.ugr.es/NGSmethDB/gbrowse/ ) for the storage and retrieval of methylation data derived from NGS. Two cytosine methylation contexts (CpG and CAG/CTG) are considered. Through a browser interface coupled to a MySQL backend and several data mining tools, the user can search for methylation states in a set of tissues, retrieve methylation values for a set of tissues in a given chromosomal region, or display the methylation of promoters among different tissues. NGSmethDB is currently populated with human, mouse and Arabidopsis data, but other methylomes will be incorporated through an automatic pipeline as soon as new data become available. Dump downloads for three coverage levels (1, 5 or 10 reads) are available. NGSmethDB will be useful for experimental researchers, as well as for bioinformaticians, who might use the data as input for further research. 
 Alternative splicing is emerging as a major mechanism for the expansion of the transcriptome and proteome diversity, particularly in human and other vertebrates. However, the proportion of alternative transcripts and proteins actually endowed with functional activity is currently highly debated. We present here a new release of ASPicDB which now provides a unique annotation resource of human protein variants generated by alternative splicing. A total of 256 939 protein variants from 17 191 multi-exon genes have been extensively annotated through state of the art machine learning tools providing information of the protein type (globular and transmembrane), localization, presence of PFAM domains, signal peptides, GPI-anchor propeptides, transmembrane and coiled-coil segments. Furthermore, full-length variants can be now specifically selected based on the annotation of CAGE-tags and polyA signal and/or polyA sites, marking transcription initiation and termination sites, respectively. The retrieval can be carried out at gene, transcript, exon, protein or splice site level allowing the selection of data sets fulfilling one or more features settled by the user. The retrieval interface also enables the selection of protein variants showing specific differences in the annotated features. ASPicDB is available at http://www.caspur.it/ASPicDB/ . 
 PSSRdb (Polymorphic Simple Sequence Repeats database) ( http://www.cdfd.org.in/PSSRdb/ ) is a relational database of polymorphic simple sequence repeats (PSSRs) extracted from 85 different species of prokaryotes. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are the tandem repeats of nucleotide motifs of the sizes 1–6 bp and are highly polymorphic. SSR mutations in and around coding regions affect transcription and translation of genes. Such changes underpin phase variations and antigenic variations seen in some bacteria. Although SSR-mediated phase variation and antigenic variations have been well-studied in some bacteria there seems a lot of other species of prokaryotes yet to be investigated for SSR mediated adaptive and other evolutionary advantages. As a part of our on-going studies on SSR polymorphism in prokaryotes we compared the genome sequences of various strains and isolates available for 85 different species of prokaryotes and extracted a number of SSRs showing length variations and created a relational database called PSSRdb. This database gives useful information such as location of PSSRs in genomes, length variation across genomes, the regions harboring PSSRs, etc. The information provided in this database is very useful for further research and analysis of SSRs in prokaryotes. 
 The Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server (AGRIS; http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/ ) provides a comprehensive resource for gene regulatory studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . Three interlinked databases, AtTFDB, AtcisDB and AtRegNet, furnish comprehensive and updated information on transcription factors (TFs), predicted and experimentally verified cis -regulatory elements (CREs) and their interactions, respectively. In addition to significant contributions in the identification of the entire set of TF–DNA interactions, which are the key to understand the gene regulatory networks that govern Arabidopsis gene expression, tools recently incorporated into AGRIS include the complete set of words length 5–15 present in the Arabidopsis genome and the integration of AtRegNet with visualization tools, such as the recently developed ReIN application. All the information in AGRIS is publicly available and downloadable upon registration. 
 TADB ( http://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/TADB/ ) is an integrated database that provides comprehensive information about Type 2 toxin–antitoxin (TA) loci, genetic features that are richly distributed throughout bacterial and archaeal genomes. Two-gene and much less frequently three-gene Type 2 TA loci code for cognate partners that have been hypothesized or demonstrated to play key roles in stress response, bacterial physiology and stabilization of horizontally acquired genetic elements. TADB offers a unique compilation of both predicted and experimentally supported Type 2 TA loci-relevant data and currently contains 10 753 Type 2 TA gene pairs identified within 1240 prokaryotic genomes, and details of over 240 directly relevant scientific publications. A broad range of similarity search, sequence alignment, genome context browser and phylogenetic tools are readily accessible via TADB. We propose that TADB will facilitate efficient, multi-disciplinary and innovative exploration of the bacteria and archaea Type 2 TA space, better defining presently recognized TA-related phenomena and potentially even leading to yet-to-be envisaged frontiers. The TADB database, envisaged as a one-stop shop for Type 2 TA-related research, will be maintained, updated and improved regularly to ensure its ongoing maximum utility to the research community. 
 An essential prerequisite for any systems-level understanding of cellular functions is to correctly uncover and annotate all functional interactions among proteins in the cell. Toward this goal, remarkable progress has been made in recent years, both in terms of experimental measurements and computational prediction techniques. However, public efforts to collect and present protein interaction information have struggled to keep up with the pace of interaction discovery, partly because protein–protein interaction information can be error-prone and require considerable effort to annotate. Here, we present an update on the online database resource Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING); it provides uniquely comprehensive coverage and ease of access to both experimental as well as predicted interaction information. Interactions in STRING are provided with a confidence score, and accessory information such as protein domains and 3D structures is made available, all within a stable and consistent identifier space. New features in STRING include an interactive network viewer that can cluster networks on demand, updated on-screen previews of structural information including homology models, extensive data updates and strongly improved connectivity and integration with third-party resources. Version 9.0 of STRING covers more than 1100 completely sequenced organisms; the resource can be reached at http://string-db.org . 
 Computational identification of putative microRNA (miRNA) targets is an important step towards elucidating miRNA functions. Several miRNA target-prediction algorithms have been developed followed by publicly available databases of these predictions. Here we present a new database offering miRNA target predictions of several binding types, identified by our recently developed modular algorithm RepTar. RepTar is based on identification of repetitive elements in 3′-UTRs and is independent of both evolutionary conservation and conventional binding patterns (i.e. Watson–Crick pairing of ‘seed’ regions). The modularity of RepTar enables the prediction of targets with conventional seed sites as well as rarer targets with non-conventional sites, such as sites with seed wobbles (G-U pairing in the seed region), 3′-compensatory sites and the newly discovered centered sites. Furthermore, RepTar’s independence of conservation enables the prediction of cellular targets of the less evolutionarily conserved viral miRNAs. Thus, the RepTar database contains genome-wide predictions of human and mouse miRNAs as well as predictions of cellular targets of human and mouse viral miRNAs. These predictions are presented in a user-friendly database, which allows browsing through the putative sites as well as conducting simple and advanced queries including data intersections of various types. The RepTar database is available at http://reptar.ekmd.huji.ac.il . 
 ODB (Operon DataBase) aims to collect data of all known and conserved operons in completely sequenced genomes. Three newly updated features of this database have been added as follows: (i) Data from included operons were updated. The genome-wide analysis of transcription and transcriptional units has become popular recently and ODB successfully integrates these high-throughput operon data, including genome-wide transcriptional units of five prokaryotes and two eukaryotes. The current version of our database contains information from about 10 000 known operons in more than 50 genomes, and more than 400 000 conserved operons obtained from more than 1000 bacterial genomes. (ii) ODB proposes the idea of reference operons as a new operon prediction tool. A reference operon, a set of possible orthologous genes that organize operons, is defined by clustering all known operons. A large number of known operons, including the recently added genome-wide analysis of operons, allowed us to define more reliable reference operons. (iii) ODB also provides new graphical interfaces. One is for comparative analyses of operon structures in multiple genomes. The other is for visualization of possible operons in multiple genomes obtained from the reference operons. The 2011 updated version of ODB is now available at http://operondb.jp/ . 
 The initiation and regulation of transcription in eukaryotes is complex and involves a large number of transcription factors (TFs), which are known to bind to the regulatory regions of eukaryotic DNA. Apart from TF–DNA binding, protein–protein interaction involving TFs is an essential component of the machinery facilitating transcriptional regulation. Proteins that interact with TFs in the context of transcription regulation but do not bind to the DNA themselves, we consider transcription co-factors (TcoFs). The influence of TcoFs on transcriptional regulation and initiation, although indirect, has been shown to be significant with the functionality of TFs strongly influenced by the presence of TcoFs. While the role of TFs and their interaction with regulatory DNA regions has been well-studied, the association between TFs and TcoFs has so far been given less attention. Here, we present a resource that is comprised of a collection of human TFs and the TcoFs with which they interact. Other proteins that have a proven interaction with a TF, but are not considered TcoFs are also included. Our database contains 157 high-confidence TcoFs and additionally 379 hypothetical TcoFs. These have been identified and classified according to the type of available evidence for their involvement in transcriptional regulation and their presence in the cell nucleus. We have divided TcoFs into four groups, one of which contains high-confidence TcoFs and three others contain TcoFs which are hypothetical to different extents. We have developed the Dragon Database for Human Transcription Co-Factors and Transcription Factor Interacting Proteins (TcoF-DB). A web-based interface for this resource can be freely accessed at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/tcof/ and http://apps.sanbi.ac.za/tcof/ . 
 Since its inception in 1994, The RNA Modification Database (RNAMDB, http://rna-mdb.cas.albany.edu/RNAmods/ ) has served as a focal point for information pertaining to naturally occurring RNA modifications. In its current state, the database employs an easy-to-use, searchable interface for obtaining detailed data on the 109 currently known RNA modifications. Each entry provides the chemical structure, common name and symbol, elemental composition and mass, CA registry numbers and index name, phylogenetic source, type of RNA species in which it is found, and references to the first reported structure determination and synthesis. Though newly transferred in its entirety to The RNA Institute, the RNAMDB continues to grow with two notable additions, agmatidine and 8-methyladenosine, appended in the last year. The RNA Modification Database is staying up-to-date with significant improvements being prepared for inclusion within the next year and the following year. The expanded future role of The RNA Modification Database will be to serve as a primary information portal for researchers across the entire spectrum of RNA-related research. 
 This study presents the Yeast Promoter Atlas (YPA, http://ypa.ee.ncku.edu.tw/ or http://ypa.csbb.ntu.edu.tw/ ) database, which aims to collect comprehensive promoter features in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . YPA integrates nine kinds of promoter features including promoter sequences, genes’ transcription boundaries—transcription start sites (TSSs), five prime untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) and three prime untranslated regions (3′UTRs), TATA boxes, transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), nucleosome occupancy, DNA bendability, transcription factor (TF) binding, TF knockout expression and TF–TF physical interaction. YPA is designed to present data in a unified manner as many important observations are revealed only when these promoter features are considered altogether. For example, DNA rigidity can prevent nucleosome packaging, thereby making TFBSs in the rigid DNA regions more accessible to TFs. Integrating nucleosome occupancy, DNA bendability, TF binding, TF knockout expression and TFBS data helps to identify which TFBS is actually functional. In YPA, various promoter features can be accessed in a centralized and organized platform. Researchers can easily view if the TFBSs in an interested promoter are occupied by nucleosomes or located in a rigid DNA segment and know if the expression of the downstream gene responds to the knockout of the corresponding TFs. Compared to other established yeast promoter databases, YPA collects not only TFBSs but also many other promoter features to help biologists study transcriptional regulation. 
 The RNA-Binding Protein DataBase (RBPDB) is a collection of experimental observations of RNA-binding sites, both in vitro and in vivo , manually curated from primary literature. To build RBPDB, we performed a literature search for experimental binding data for all RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with known RNA-binding domains in four metazoan species (human, mouse, fly and worm). In total, RPBDB contains binding data on 272 RBPs, including 71 that have motifs in position weight matrix format, and 36 sets of sequences of in vivo -bound transcripts from immunoprecipitation experiments. The database is accessible by a web interface which allows browsing by domain or by organism, searching and export of records, and bulk data downloads. Users can also use RBPDB to scan sequences for RBP-binding sites. RBPDB is freely available, without registration at http://rbpdb.ccbr.utoronto.ca/. 
 AREsite is an online resource for the detailed investigation of AU-rich elements (ARE) in vertebrate mRNA 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs). AREs are one of the most prominent cis- acting regulatory elements found in 3′-UTRs of mRNAs. Various ARE-binding proteins that possess RNA stabilizing or destabilizing functions are recruited by sequence-specific motifs. Recent findings suggest an essential role of the structural mRNA context in which these sequence motifs are embedded. AREsite is the first database that allows to quantify the structuredness of ARE motif sites in terms of opening energies and accessibility probabilities. Moreover, we also provide a detailed phylogenetic analysis of ARE motifs and incorporate information about experimentally validated targets of the ARE-binding proteins TTP, HuR and Auf1. The database is publicly available at: http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/AREsite.
 The Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS at the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany) has many years of experience in providing annotated collections of biological data. Selected data sets of high relevance, such as model genomes, are subjected to careful manual curation, while the bulk of high-throughput data is annotated by automatic means. High-quality reference resources developed in the past and still actively maintained include Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Neurospora crassa and Arabidopsis thaliana genome databases as well as several protein interaction data sets (MPACT, MPPI and CORUM). More recent projects are PhenomiR, the database on microRNA-related phenotypes, and MIPS PlantsDB for integrative and comparative plant genome research. The interlinked resources SIMAP and PEDANT provide homology relationships as well as up-to-date and consistent annotation for 38 000 000 protein sequences. PPLIPS and CCancer are versatile tools for proteomics and functional genomics interfacing to a database of compilations from gene lists extracted from literature. A novel literature-mining tool, EXCERBT, gives access to structured information on classified relations between genes, proteins, phenotypes and diseases extracted from Medline abstracts by semantic analysis. All databases described here, as well as the detailed descriptions of our projects can be accessed through the MIPS WWW server ( http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de ). 
 The polyglutamine diseases are caused in part by a gain-of-function mechanism of neuronal toxicity involving protein conformational changes that result in the formation and deposition of β-sheet rich aggregates. Recent evidence suggests that the misfolding mechanism is context-dependent, and that properties of the host protein, including the domain architecture and location of the repeat tract, can modulate aggregation. In order to allow the bioinformatic investigation of the context of polyglutamines, we have constructed a database, PolyQ ( http://pxgrid.med.monash.edu.au/polyq ). We have collected the sequences of all human proteins containing runs of seven or more glutamine residues and annotated their sequences with domain information. PolyQ can be interrogated such that the sequence context of polyglutamine repeats in disease and non-disease associated proteins can be investigated. 
 DOMINE is a comprehensive collection of known and predicted domain–domain interactions (DDIs) compiled from 15 different sources. The updated DOMINE includes 2285 new domain–domain interactions (DDIs) inferred from experimentally characterized high-resolution three-dimensional structures, and about 3500 novel predictions by five computational approaches published over the last 3 years. These additions bring the total number of unique DDIs in the updated version to 26 219 among 5140 unique Pfam domains, a 23% increase compared to 20 513 unique DDIs among 4346 unique domains in the previous version. The updated version now contains 6634 known DDIs, and features a new classification scheme to assign confidence levels to predicted DDIs. DOMINE will serve as a valuable resource to those studying protein and domain interactions. Most importantly, DOMINE will not only serve as an excellent reference to bench scientists testing for new interactions but also to bioinformaticans seeking to predict novel protein–protein interactions based on the DDIs. The contents of the DOMINE are available at http://domine.utdallas.edu . 
 The Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) is a public database that archives and disseminates genetic and protein interaction data from model organisms and humans ( http://www.thebiogrid.org ). BioGRID currently holds 347 966 interactions (170 162 genetic, 177 804 protein) curated from both high-throughput data sets and individual focused studies, as derived from over 23 000 publications in the primary literature. Complete coverage of the entire literature is maintained for budding yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), fission yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) and thale cress ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), and efforts to expand curation across multiple metazoan species are underway. The BioGRID houses 48 831 human protein interactions that have been curated from 10 247 publications. Current curation drives are focused on particular areas of biology to enable insights into conserved networks and pathways that are relevant to human health. The BioGRID 3.0 web interface contains new search and display features that enable rapid queries across multiple data types and sources. An automated Interaction Management System (IMS) is used to prioritize, coordinate and track curation across international sites and projects. BioGRID provides interaction data to several model organism databases, resources such as Entrez-Gene and other interaction meta-databases. The entire BioGRID 3.0 data collection may be downloaded in multiple file formats, including PSI MI XML. Source code for BioGRID 3.0 is freely available without any restrictions. 
 We updated the plant transcription factor (TF) database to version 2.0 (PlantTFDB 2.0, http://planttfdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn ) which contains 53 319 putative TFs predicted from 49 species. We made detailed annotation including general information, domain feature, gene ontology, expression pattern and ortholog groups, as well as cross references to various databases and literature citations for these TFs classified into 58 newly defined families with computational approach and manual inspection. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for each family can be shown as Weblogo pictures or downloaded as text files. We have redesigned the user interface in the new version. Users can search TFs with much more flexibility through the improved advanced search page, and the search results can be exported into various formats for further analysis. In addition, we now provide web service for advanced users to access PlantTFDB 2.0 more efficiently. 
 Consideration of biomolecules in terms of their molecular building blocks provides valuable new information regarding their synthesis, degradation and similarity. Here, we present the FragmentStore, a resource for the comparison of fragments found in metabolites, drugs or toxic compounds. Starting from 13 000 metabolites, 16 000 drugs and 2200 toxic compounds we generated 35 000 different building blocks (fragments), which are not only relevant to their biosynthesis and degradation but also provide important information regarding side-effects and toxicity. The FragmentStore provides a variety of search options such as 2D structure, molecular weight, rotatable bonds, etc. Various analysis tools have been implemented including the calculation of amino acid preferences of fragments’ binding sites, classification of fragments based on the enzyme classification class of the enzyme(s) they bind to and small molecule library generation via a fragment-assembler tool. Using the FragmentStore, it is now possible to identify the common fragments of different classes of molecules and generate hypotheses about the effects of such intersections. For instance, the co-occurrence of fragments in different drugs may indicate similar targets and possible off-target interactions whereas the co-occurrence of fragments in a drug and a toxic compound/metabolite could be indicative of side-effects. The database is publicly available at:  http://bioinformatics.charite.de/fragment_store . 
 BTO, the BRENDA Tissue Ontology ( http://www.BTO.brenda-enzymes.org ) represents a comprehensive structured encyclopedia of tissue terms. The project started in 2003 to create a connection between the enzyme data collection of the BRENDA enzyme database and a structured network of source tissues and cell types. Currently, BTO contains more than 4600 different anatomical structures, tissues, cell types and cell lines, classified under generic categories corresponding to the rules and formats of the Gene Ontology Consortium and organized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Most of the terms are endowed with comments on their derivation or definitions. The content of the ontology is constantly curated with ∼1000 new terms each year. Four different types of relationships between the terms are implemented. A versatile web interface with several search and navigation functionalities allows convenient online access to the BTO and to the enzymes isolated from the tissues. Important areas of applications of the BTO terms are the detection of enzymes in tissues and the provision of a solid basis for text-mining approaches in this field. It is widely used by lab scientists, curators of genomic and biochemical databases and bioinformaticians. The BTO is freely available at http://www.obofoundry.org . 
 Fast viral adaptation and the implication of this rapid evolution in the emergence of several new infectious diseases have turned this issue into a major challenge for various research domains. Indeed, viruses are involved in the development of a wide range of pathologies and understanding how viruses and host cells interact in the context of adaptation remains an open question. In order to provide insights into the complex interactions between viruses and their host organisms and namely in the acquisition of novel functions through exchanges of genetic material, we developed the PhEVER database. This database aims at providing accurate evolutionary and phylogenetic information to analyse the nature of virus–virus and virus–host lateral gene transfers. PhEVER ( http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/databases/phever ) is a unique database of homologous families both (i) between sequences from different viruses and (ii) between viral sequences and sequences from cellular organisms. PhEVER integrates extensive data from up-to-date completely sequenced genomes (2426 non-redundant viral genomes, 1007 non-redundant prokaryotic genomes, 43 eukaryotic genomes ranging from plants to vertebrates) and offers a clustering of proteins into homologous families containing at least one viral sequences, as well as alignments and phylogenies for each of these families. Public access to PhEVER is available through its webpage and through all dedicated ACNUC retrieval systems. 
 Tomato Functional Genomics Database (TFGD) provides a comprehensive resource to store, query, mine, analyze, visualize and integrate large-scale tomato functional genomics data sets. The database is functionally expanded from the previously described Tomato Expression Database by including metabolite profiles as well as large-scale tomato small RNA (sRNA) data sets. Computational pipelines have been developed to process microarray, metabolite and sRNA data sets archived in the database, respectively, and TFGD provides downloads of all the analyzed results. TFGD is also designed to enable users to easily retrieve biologically important information through a set of efficient query interfaces and analysis tools, including improved array probe annotations as well as tools to identify co-expressed genes, significantly affected biological processes and biochemical pathways from gene expression data sets and miRNA targets, and to integrate transcript and metabolite profiles, and sRNA and mRNA sequences. The suite of tools and interfaces in TFGD allow intelligent data mining of recently released and continually expanding large-scale tomato functional genomics data sets. TFGD is available at http://ted.bti.cornell.edu.
 ConsensusPathDB is a meta-database that integrates different types of functional interactions from heterogeneous interaction data resources. Physical protein interactions, metabolic and signaling reactions and gene regulatory interactions are integrated in a seamless functional association network that simultaneously describes multiple functional aspects of genes, proteins, complexes, metabolites, etc. With 155 432 human, 194 480 yeast and 13 648 mouse complex functional interactions (originating from 18 databases on human and eight databases on yeast and mouse interactions each), ConsensusPathDB currently constitutes the most comprehensive publicly available interaction repository for these species. The Web interface at http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de offers different ways of utilizing these integrated interaction data, in particular with tools for visualization, analysis and interpretation of high-throughput expression data in the light of functional interactions and biological pathways. 
 REPAIRtoire is the first comprehensive database resource for systems biology of DNA damage and repair. The database collects and organizes the following types of information: (i) DNA damage linked to environmental mutagenic and cytotoxic agents, (ii) pathways comprising individual processes and enzymatic reactions involved in the removal of damage, (iii) proteins participating in DNA repair and (iv) diseases correlated with mutations in genes encoding DNA repair proteins. REPAIRtoire provides also links to publications and external databases. REPAIRtoire contains information about eight main DNA damage checkpoint, repair and tolerance pathways: DNA damage signaling, direct reversal repair, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, homologous recombination repair, nonhomologous end-joining and translesion synthesis. The pathway/protein dataset is currently limited to three model organisms: Escherichia coli , Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens . The DNA repair and tolerance pathways are represented as graphs and in tabular form with descriptions of each repair step and corresponding proteins, and individual entries are cross-referenced to supporting literature and primary databases. REPAIRtoire can be queried by the name of pathway, protein, enzymatic complex, damage and disease. In addition, a tool for drawing custom DNA–protein complexes is available online. REPAIRtoire is freely available and can be accessed at http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/ . 
 Protein–protein interactions are central to almost any cellular process. Although typically protein interfaces are large, it is well established that only a relatively small region, the so-called ‘hot spot’, contributes the most to the total binding energy. There is a clear interest in identifying hot spots because of its application in drug discovery and protein design. Presaging Critical Residues in Protein Interfaces Database (PCRPi-DB) is a public repository that archives computationally annotated hot spots in protein complexes for which the 3D structure is known. Hot spots have been annotated using a new and highly accurate computational method developed in the lab. PCRPi-DB is freely available to the scientific community at http://www.bioinsilico.org/PCRPIDB . Besides browsing and querying the contents of the database, extensive documentation and links to relevant on-line resources and contents are available to users. PCRPi-DB is updated on a weekly basis. 
 Protective antigens are specifically targeted by the acquired immune response of the host and are able to induce protection in the host against infectious and non-infectious diseases. Protective antigens play important roles in vaccine development, as biological markers for disease diagnosis, and for analysis of fundamental host immunity against diseases. Protegen is a web-based central database and analysis system that curates, stores and analyzes protective antigens. Basic antigen information and experimental evidence are curated from peer-reviewed articles. More detailed gene/protein information (e.g. DNA and protein sequences, and COG classification) are automatically extracted from existing databases using internally developed scripts. Bioinformatics programs are also applied to compute different antigen features, such as protein weight and pI, and subcellular localizations of bacterial proteins. Presently, 590 protective antigens have been curated against over 100 infectious diseases caused by pathogens and non-infectious diseases (including cancers and allergies). A user-friendly web query and visualization interface is developed for interactive protective antigen search. A customized BLAST sequence similarity search is also developed for analysis of new sequences provided by the users. To support data exchange, the information of protective antigens is stored in the Vaccine Ontology (VO) in OWL format and can also be exported to FASTA and Excel files. Protegen is publically available at http://www.violinet.org/protegen . 
 ModBase ( http://salilab.org/modbase ) is a database of annotated comparative protein structure models. The models are calculated by ModPipe, an automated modeling pipeline that relies primarily on Modeller for fold assignment, sequence–structure alignment, model building and model assessment ( http://salilab.org/modeller/ ). ModBase currently contains 10 355 444 reliable models for domains in 2 421 920 unique protein sequences. ModBase allows users to update comparative models on demand, and request modeling of additional sequences through an interface to the ModWeb modeling server ( http://salilab.org/modweb ). ModBase models are available through the ModBase interface as well as the Protein Model Portal ( http://www.proteinmodelportal.org/ ). Recently developed associated resources include the SALIGN server for multiple sequence and structure alignment ( http://salilab.org/salign ), the ModEval server for predicting the accuracy of protein structure models ( http://salilab.org/modeval ), the PCSS server for predicting which peptides bind to a given protein ( http://salilab.org/pcss ) and the FoXS server for calculating and fitting Small Angle X-ray Scattering profiles ( http://salilab.org/foxs ). 
 The GPCRDB is a Molecular Class-Specific Information System (MCSIS) that collects, combines, validates and disseminates large amounts of heterogeneous data on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The GPCRDB contains experimental data on sequences, ligand-binding constants, mutations and oligomers, as well as many different types of computationally derived data such as multiple sequence alignments and homology models. The GPCRDB provides access to the data via a number of different access methods. It offers visualization and analysis tools, and a number of query systems. The data is updated automatically on a monthly basis. The GPCRDB can be found online at http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/ . 
 The YEAst Search for Transcriptional Regulators And Consensus Tracking (YEASTRACT) information system ( http://www.yeastract.com ) was developed to support the analysis of transcription regulatory associations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Last updated in June 2010, this database contains over 48 200 regulatory associations between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes, including 298 specific DNA-binding sites for 110 characterized TFs. All regulatory associations stored in the database were revisited and detailed information on the experimental evidences that sustain those associations was added and classified as direct or indirect evidences. The inclusion of this new data, gathered in response to the requests of YEASTRACT users, allows the user to restrict its queries to subsets of the data based on the existence or not of experimental evidences for the direct action of the TFs in the promoter region of their target genes. Another new feature of this release is the availability of all data through a machine readable web-service interface. Users are no longer restricted to the set of available queries made available through the existing web interface, and can use the web service interface to query, retrieve and exploit the YEASTRACT data using their own implementation of additional functionalities. The YEASTRACT information system is further complemented with several computational tools that facilitate the use of the curated data when answering a number of important biological questions. Since its first release in 2006, YEASTRACT has been extensively used by hundreds of researchers from all over the world. We expect that by making the new data and services available, the system will continue to be instrumental for yeast biologists and systems biology researchers. 
 High-resolution structures of proteins remain the most valuable source for understanding their function in the cell and provide leads for drug design. Since the availability of sufficient protein structures to tackle complex problems such as modeling backbone moves or docking remains a problem, alternative approaches using small, recurrent protein fragments have been employed. Here we present two databases that provide a vast resource for implementing such fragment-based strategies. The BriX database contains fragments from over 7000 non-homologous proteins from the Astral collection, segmented in lengths from 4 to 14 residues and clustered according to structural similarity, summing up to a content of 2 million fragments per length. To overcome the lack of loops classified in BriX, we constructed the Loop BriX database of non-regular structure elements, clustered according to end-to-end distance between the regular residues flanking the loop. Both databases are available online ( http://brix.crg.es ) and can be accessed through a user-friendly web-interface. For high-throughput queries a web-based API is provided, as well as full database downloads. In addition, two exciting applications are provided as online services: (i) user-submitted structures can be covered on the fly with BriX classes, representing putative structural variation throughout the protein and (ii) gaps or low-confidence regions in these structures can be bridged with matching fragments. 
 The ThYme (Thioester-active enzYme; http://www.enzyme.cbirc.iastate.edu ) database has been constructed to bring together amino acid sequences and 3D (tertiary) structures of all the enzymes constituting the fatty acid synthesis and polyketide synthesis cycles. These enzymes are active on thioester-containing substrates, specifically those that are parts of the acyl-CoA synthase, acyl-CoA carboxylase, acyl transferase, ketoacyl synthase, ketoacyl reductase, hydroxyacyl dehydratase, enoyl reductase and thioesterase enzyme groups. These groups have been classified into families, members of which are similar in sequences, tertiary structures and catalytic mechanisms, implying common protein ancestry. ThYme is continually updated as sequences and tertiary structures become available. 
 The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena ) is Europe’s primary nucleotide-sequence repository. The ENA consists of three main databases: the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the Trace Archive and EMBL-Bank. The objective of ENA is to support and promote the use of nucleotide sequencing as an experimental research platform by providing data submission, archive, search and download services. In this article, we outline these services and describe major changes and improvements introduced during 2010. These include extended EMBL-Bank and SRA-data submission services, extended ENA Browser functionality, support for submitting data to the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) through SRA, and the launch of a new sequence similarity search service. 
 The concept of homology drives speculation on a gene’s function in any given species when its biological roles in other species are characterized. With reference to a specific species radiation homologous relations define orthologs, i.e. descendants from a single gene of the ancestor. The large-scale delineation of gene genealogies is a challenging task, and the numerous approaches to the problem reflect the importance of the concept of orthology as a cornerstone for comparative studies. Here, we present the updated OrthoDB catalog of eukaryotic orthologs delineated at each radiation of the species phylogeny in an explicitly hierarchical manner of over 100 species of vertebrates, arthropods and fungi (including the metazoa level). New database features include functional annotations, and quantification of evolutionary divergence and relations among orthologous groups. The interface features extended phyletic profile querying and enhanced text-based searches. The ever-increasing sampling of sequenced eukaryotic genomes brings a clearer account of the majority of gene genealogies that will facilitate informed hypotheses of gene function in newly sequenced genomes. Furthermore, uniform analysis across lineages as different as vertebrates, arthropods and fungi with divergence levels varying from several to hundreds of millions of years will provide essential data for uncovering and quantifying long-term trends of gene evolution. OrthoDB is freely accessible from http://cegg.unige.ch/orthodb . 
 We describe here OMPdb, which is currently the most complete and comprehensive collection of integral β-barrel outer membrane proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. The database currently contains 69 354 proteins, which are classified into 85 families, based mainly on structural and functional criteria. Although OMPdb follows the annotation scheme of Pfam, many of the families included in the database were not previously described or annotated in other publicly available databases. There are also cross-references to other databases, references to the literature and annotation for sequence features, like transmembrane segments and signal peptides. Furthermore, via the web interface, the user can not only browse the available data, but submit advanced text searches and run BLAST queries against the database protein sequences or domain searches against the collection of profile Hidden Markov Models that represent each family’s domain organization as well. The database is freely accessible for academic users at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/OMPdb and we expect it to be useful for genome-wide analyses, comparative genomics as well as for providing training and test sets for predictive algorithms regarding transmembrane β-barrels. 
 We present WebGeSTer DB, the largest database of intrinsic transcription terminators ( http://pallab.serc.iisc.ernet.in/gester ). The database comprises of a million terminators identified in 1060 bacterial genome sequences and 798 plasmids. Users can obtain both graphic and tabular results on putative terminators based on default or user-defined parameters. The results are arranged in different tiers to facilitate retrieval, as per the specific requirements. An interactive map has been incorporated to visualize the distribution of terminators across the whole genome. Analysis of the results, both at the whole-genome level and with respect to terminators downstream of specific genes, offers insight into the prevalence of canonical and non-canonical terminators across different phyla. The data in the database reinforce the paradigm that intrinsic termination is a conserved and efficient regulatory mechanism in bacteria. Our database is freely accessible. 
 The primary purpose of PHOSIDA ( http://www.phosida.com ) is to manage posttranslational modification sites of various species ranging from bacteria to human. Since its last report, PHOSIDA has grown significantly in size and evolved in scope. It comprises more than 80 000 phosphorylated, N-glycosylated or acetylated sites from nine different species. All sites are obtained from high-resolution mass spectrometric data using the same stringent quality criteria. One of the main distinguishing features of PHOSIDA is the provision of a wide range of analysis tools. PHOSIDA is comprised of three main components: the database environment, the prediction platform and the toolkit section. The database environment integrates and combines high-resolution proteomic data with multiple annotations. High-accuracy species-specific phosphorylation and acetylation site predictors, trained on the modification sites contained in PHOSIDA, allow the in silico determination of modified sites on any protein on the basis of the primary sequence. The toolkit section contains methods that search for sequence motif matches or identify de novo consensus, sequences from large scale data sets. 
 The conformational dynamics data bank (CDDB, http://www.cdyn.org ) is a database that aims to provide comprehensive results on the conformational dynamics of high molecular weight proteins and protein assemblies. Analysis is performed using a recently introduced coarse-grained computational approach that is applied to the majority of structures present in the electron microscopy data bank (EMDB). Results include equilibrium thermal fluctuations and elastic strain energy distributions that identify rigid versus flexible protein domains generally, as well as those associated with specific functional transitions, and correlations in molecular motions that identify molecular regions that are highly coupled dynamically, with implications for allosteric mechanisms. A practical web-based search interface enables users to easily collect conformational dynamics data in various formats. The data bank is maintained and updated automatically to include conformational dynamics results for new structural entries as they become available in the EMDB. The CDDB complements static structural information to facilitate the investigation and interpretation of the biological function of proteins and protein assemblies essential to cell function. 
 The Protein Circular Dichroism Data Bank (PCDDB) is a public repository that archives and freely distributes circular dichroism (CD) and synchrotron radiation CD (SRCD) spectral data and their associated experimental metadata. All entries undergo validation and curation procedures to ensure completeness, consistency and quality of the data included. A web-based interface enables users to browse and query sample types, sample conditions, experimental parameters and provides spectra in both graphical display format and as downloadable text files. The entries are linked, when appropriate, to primary sequence (UniProt) and structural (PDB) databases, as well as to secondary databases such as the Enzyme Commission functional classification database and the CATH fold classification database, as well as to literature citations. The PCDDB is available at: http://pcddb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk . 
 Binary subcomplexes in proteins database (BISC) is a new protein–protein interaction (PPI) database linking up the two communities most active in their characterization: structural biology and functional genomics researchers. The BISC resource offers users (i) a structural perspective and related information about binary subcomplexes (i.e. physical direct interactions between proteins) that are either structurally characterized or modellable entries in the main functional genomics PPI databases BioGRID, IntAct and HPRD; (ii) selected web services to further investigate the validity of postulated PPI by inspection of their hypothetical modelled interfaces. Among other uses we envision that this resource can help identify possible false positive PPI in current database records. BISC is freely available at http://bisc.cse.ucsc.edu . 
 EcoCyc ( http://EcoCyc.org ) is a comprehensive model organism database for Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. From the scientific literature, EcoCyc captures the functions of individual E. coli gene products; their regulation at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and protein level; and their organization into operons, complexes and pathways. EcoCyc users can search and browse the information in multiple ways. Recent improvements to the EcoCyc Web interface include combined gene/protein pages and a Regulation Summary Diagram displaying a graphical overview of all known regulatory inputs to gene expression and protein activity. The graphical representation of signal transduction pathways has been updated, and the cellular and regulatory overviews were enhanced with new functionality. A specialized undergraduate teaching resource using EcoCyc is being developed. 
 AmoebaDB ( http://AmoebaDB.org ) and MicrosporidiaDB ( http://MicrosporidiaDB.org ) are new functional genomic databases serving the amoebozoa and microsporidia research communities, respectively. AmoebaDB contains the genomes of three Entamoeba species ( E. dispar , E. invadens and E. histolityca ) and microarray expression data for E. histolytica . MicrosporidiaDB contains the genomes of Encephalitozoon cuniculi, E. intestinalis and E. bieneusi . The databases belong to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) funded EuPathDB ( http://EuPathDB.org ) Bioinformatics Resource Center family of integrated databases and assume the same architectural and graphical design as other EuPathDB resources such as PlasmoDB and TriTrypDB. Importantly they utilize the graphical strategy builder that affords a database user the ability to ask complex multi-data-type questions with relative ease and versatility. Genomic scale data can be queried based on BLAST searches, annotation keywords and gene ID searches, GO terms, sequence motifs, protein characteristics, phylogenetic relationships and functional data such as transcript (microarray and EST evidence) and protein expression data. Search strategies can be saved within a user’s profile for future retrieval and may also be shared with other researchers using a unique strategy web address. 
Cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction methods are uniquely able to reveal structures of many important macromolecules and macromolecular complexes. EMDataBank.org, a joint effort of the Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe), the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) and the National Center for Macromolecular Imaging (NCMI), is a global ‘one-stop shop’ resource for deposition and retrieval of cryoEM maps, models and associated metadata. The resource unifies public access to the two major archives containing EM-based structural data: EM Data Bank (EMDB) and Protein Data Bank (PDB), and facilitates use of EM structural data of macromolecules and macromolecular complexes by the wider scientific community.
 The Community Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Microbial Ecology Research and Analysis (CAMERA, http://camera.calit2.net/ ) is a database and associated computational infrastructure that provides a single system for depositing, locating, analyzing, visualizing and sharing data about microbial biology through an advanced web-based analysis portal. CAMERA collects and links metadata relevant to environmental metagenome data sets with annotation in a semantically-aware environment allowing users to write expressive semantic queries against the database. To meet the needs of the research community, users are able to query metadata categories such as habitat, sample type, time, location and other environmental physicochemical parameters. CAMERA is compliant with the standards promulgated by the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC), and sustains a role within the GSC in extending standards for content and format of the metagenomic data and metadata and its submission to the CAMERA repository. To ensure wide, ready access to data and annotation, CAMERA also provides data submission tools to allow researchers to share and forward data to other metagenomics sites and community data archives such as GenBank. It has multiple interfaces for easy submission of large or complex data sets, and supports pre-registration of samples for sequencing. CAMERA integrates a growing list of tools and viewers for querying, analyzing, annotating and comparing metagenome and genome data. 
 The Universal PBM Resource for Oligonucleotide-Binding Evaluation (UniPROBE) database is a centralized repository of information on the DNA-binding preferences of proteins as determined by universal protein-binding microarray (PBM) technology. Each entry for a protein (or protein complex) in UniPROBE provides the quantitative preferences for all possible nucleotide sequence variants (‘words’) of length k (‘ k -mers’), as well as position weight matrix (PWM) and graphical sequence logo representations of the k -mer data. In this update, we describe >130% expansion of the database content, incorporation of a protein BLAST (blastp) tool for finding protein sequence matches in UniPROBE, the introduction of UniPROBE accession numbers and additional database enhancements. The UniPROBE database is available at http://uniprobe.org . 
 Systems pharmacology is an emergent area that studies drug action across multiple scales of complexity, from molecular and cellular to tissue and organism levels. There is a critical need to develop network-based approaches to integrate the growing body of chemical biology knowledge with network biology. Here, we report ChemProt, a disease chemical biology database, which is based on a compilation of multiple chemical–protein annotation resources, as well as disease-associated protein–protein interactions (PPIs). We assembled more than 700 000 unique chemicals with biological annotation for 30 578 proteins. We gathered over 2-million chemical–protein interactions, which were integrated in a quality scored human PPI network of 428 429 interactions. The PPI network layer allows for studying disease and tissue specificity through each protein complex. ChemProt can assist in the in silico evaluation of environmental chemicals, natural products and approved drugs, as well as the selection of new compounds based on their activity profile against most known biological targets, including those related to adverse drug events. Results from the disease chemical biology database associate citalopram, an antidepressant, with osteogenesis imperfect and leukemia and bisphenol A, an endocrine disruptor, with certain types of cancer, respectively. The server can be accessed at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChemProt/ . 
 Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a superfamily of Ca 2+- permeable cation channels that translate cellular stimuli into electrochemical signals. Aberrant activity of TRP channels has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, such as neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease and cancer. To facilitate the understanding of the molecular network by which TRP channels are associated with biological and disease processes, we have developed the TRIP (TRansient receptor potential channel-Interacting Protein) Database ( http://www.trpchannel.org ), a manually curated database that aims to offer comprehensive information on protein–protein interactions (PPIs) of mammalian TRP channels. The TRIP Database was created by systematically curating 277 peer-reviewed literature; the current version documents 490 PPI pairs, 28 TRP channels and 297 cellular proteins. The TRIP Database provides a detailed summary of PPI data that fit into four categories: screening, validation, characterization and functional consequence. Users can find in-depth information specified in the literature on relevant analytical methods and experimental resources, such as gene constructs and cell/tissue types. The TRIP Database has user-friendly web interfaces with helpful features, including a search engine, an interaction map and a function for cross-referencing useful external databases. Our TRIP Database will provide a valuable tool to assist in understanding the molecular regulatory network of TRP channels. 
 DroID ( http://droidb.org/ ), the Drosophila Interactions Database, is a comprehensive public resource for Drosophila gene and protein interactions. DroID contains genetic interactions and experimentally detected protein–protein interactions curated from the literature and from external databases, and predicted protein interactions based on experiments in other species. Protein interactions are annotated with experimental details and periodically updated confidence scores. Data in DroID is accessible through user-friendly, intuitive interfaces that allow simple or advanced searches and graphical visualization of interaction networks. DroID has been expanded to include interaction types that enable more complete analyses of the genetic networks that underlie biological processes. In addition to protein–protein and genetic interactions, the database now includes transcription factor–gene and regulatory RNA–gene interactions. In addition, DroID now has more gene expression data that can be used to search and filter interaction networks. Orthologous gene mappings of Drosophila genes to other organisms are also available to facilitate finding interactions based on gene names and identifiers for a number of common model organisms and humans. Improvements have been made to the web and graphical interfaces to help biologists gain a comprehensive view of the interaction networks relevant to the genes and systems that they study. 
 Large numbers of long RNAs with little or no protein-coding potential [long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)] are being identified in eukaryotes. In parallel, increasing data describing the expression profiles, molecular features and functions of individual lncRNAs in a variety of systems are accumulating. To enable the systematic compilation and updating of this information, we have developed a database (lncRNAdb) containing a comprehensive list of lncRNAs that have been shown to have, or to be associated with, biological functions in eukaryotes, as well as messenger RNAs that have regulatory roles. Each entry contains referenced information about the RNA, including sequences, structural information, genomic context, expression, subcellular localization, conservation, functional evidence and other relevant information. lncRNAdb can be searched by querying published RNA names and aliases, sequences, species and associated protein-coding genes, as well as terms contained in the annotations, such as the tissues in which the transcripts are expressed and associated diseases. In addition, lncRNAdb is linked to the UCSC Genome Browser for visualization and Noncoding RNA Expression Database (NRED) for expression information from a variety of sources. lncRNAdb provides a platform for the ongoing collation of the literature pertaining to lncRNAs and their association with other genomic elements. lncRNAdb can be accessed at: http://www.lncrnadb.org/ . 
 The subcellular localization (SCL) of a microbial protein provides clues about its function, its suitability as a drug, vaccine or diagnostic target and aids experimental design. The first version of PSORTdb provided a valuable resource comprising a data set of proteins of known SCL (ePSORTdb) as well as pre-computed SCL predictions for proteomes derived from complete bacterial genomes (cPSORTdb). PSORTdb 2.0 ( http://db.psort.org ) extends user-friendly functionalities, significantly expands ePSORTdb and now contains pre-computed SCL predictions for all prokaryotes—including Archaea and Bacteria with atypical cell wall/membrane structures. cPSORTdb uses the latest version of the SCL predictor PSORTb (version 3.0), with higher genome prediction coverage and functional improvements over PSORTb 2.0, which has been the most precise bacterial SCL predictor available. PSORTdb 2.0 is the first microbial protein SCL database reported to have an automatic updating mechanism to regularly generate SCL predictions for deduced proteomes of newly sequenced prokaryotic organisms. This updating approach uses a novel sequence analysis we developed that detects whether the microbe being analyzed has an outer membrane. This identification of membrane structure permits appropriate SCL prediction in an auto-updated fashion and allows PSORTdb to serve as a practical resource for genome annotation and prokaryotic research. 
 PCDB ( http://www.pcdb.unq.edu.ar ) is a database of protein conformational diversity. For each protein, the database contains the redundant compilation of all the corresponding crystallographic structures obtained under different conditions. These structures could be considered as different instances of protein dynamism. As a measure of the conformational diversity we use the maximum RMSD obtained comparing the structures deposited for each domain. The redundant structures were extracted following CATH structural classification and cross linked with additional information. In this way it is possible to relate a given amount of conformational diversity with different levels of information, such as protein function, presence of ligands and mutations, structural classification, active site information and organism taxonomy among others. Currently the database contains 7989 domains with a total of 36581 structures from 4171 different proteins. The maximum RMSD registered is 26.7 Å and the average of different structures per domain is 4.5. 
 Elucidating the function of all predicted genes in rice remains as the ultimate goal in cereal genomics in order to ensure the development of improved varieties that will sustain an expanding world population. We constructed a gene expression database (RiceXPro, URL: http://ricexpro.dna.affrc.go.jp/ ) to provide an overview of the transcriptional changes throughout the growth of the rice plant in the field. RiceXPro contains two data sets corresponding to spatiotemporal gene expression profiles of various organs and tissues, and continuous gene expression profiles of leaf from transplanting to harvesting. A user-friendly web interface enables the extraction of specific gene expression profiles by keyword and chromosome search, and basic data analysis, thereby providing useful information as to the organ/tissue and developmental stage specificity of expression of a particular gene. Analysis tools such as t -test, calculation of fold change and degree of correlation facilitate the comparison of expression profiles between two random samples and the prediction of function of uncharacterized genes. As a repository of expression data encompassing growth in the field, this database can provide baseline information of genes that underlie various agronomically important traits in rice. 
 The Protein Ontology (PRO) provides a formal, logically-based classification of specific protein classes including structured representations of protein isoforms, variants and modified forms. Initially focused on proteins found in human, mouse and Escherichia coli , PRO now includes representations of protein complexes. The PRO Consortium works in concert with the developers of other biomedical ontologies and protein knowledge bases to provide the ability to formally organize and integrate representations of precise protein forms so as to enhance accessibility to results of protein research. PRO ( http://pir.georgetown.edu/pro ) is part of the Open Biomedical Ontology Foundry. 
 Protein secretion is a key virulence mechanism of pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria, which makes the investigation of secreted proteins (‘effectors’) crucial for understanding the molecular bacterium–host interactions. Effective ( http://effectors.org ) is a database of predicted bacterial secreted proteins, implementing two complementary prediction strategies for protein secretion: the identification of eukaryotic-like protein domains and the recognition of signal peptides in amino acid sequences. The Effective web portal provides user-friendly tools for browsing and retrieving comprehensive precalculated predictions for whole bacterial genomes as well as for the interactive prediction of effectors in user-provided protein sequences. 
 dictyBase ( http://www.dictybase.org ), the model organism database for Dictyostelium , aims to provide the broad biomedical research community with well integrated, high quality data and tools for Dictyostelium discoideum and related species. dictyBase houses the complete genome sequence, ESTs, and the entire body of literature relevant to Dictyostelium . This information is curated to provide accurate gene models and functional annotations, with the goal of fully annotating the genome to provide a ‘reference genome’ in the Amoebozoa clade. We highlight several new features in the present update: (i) new annotations; (ii) improved interface with web 2.0 functionality; (iii) the initial steps towards a genome portal for the Amoebozoa; (iv) ortholog display; and (v) the complete integration of the Dicty Stock Center with dictyBase. 
 AgBase ( http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/ ) provides resources to facilitate modeling of functional genomics data and structural and functional annotation of agriculturally important animal, plant, microbe and parasite genomes. The website is redesigned to improve accessibility and ease of use, including improved search capabilities. Expanded capabilities include new dedicated pages for horse, cat, dog, cotton, rice and soybean. We currently provide 590 240 Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to 105 454 gene products in 64 different species, including GO annotations linked to transcripts represented on agricultural microarrays. For many of these arrays, this provides the only functional annotation available. GO annotations are available for download and we provide comprehensive, species-specific GO annotation files for 18 different organisms. The tools available at AgBase have been expanded and several existing tools improved based upon user feedback. One of seven new tools available at AgBase, GOModeler , supports hypothesis testing from functional genomics data. We host several associated databases and provide genome browsers for three agricultural pathogens. Moreover, we provide comprehensive training resources (including worked examples and tutorials) via links to Educational Resources at the AgBase website. 
 Despite the availability of a large number of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) in several species, researchers are often limited to using very small subsets in a few organisms due to the high prevalence of spurious interactions. In spite of the importance of quality assessment of experimentally determined PPIs, a surprisingly small number of databases provide interactions with scores and confidence levels. We introduce HitPredict ( http://hintdb.hgc.jp/htp/ ), a database with quality assessed PPIs in nine species. HitPredict assigns a confidence level to interactions based on a reliability score that is computed using evidence from sequence, structure and functional annotations of the interacting proteins. HitPredict was first released in 2005 and is updated annually. The current release contains 36 930 proteins with 176 983 non-redundant, physical interactions, of which 116 198 (66%) are predicted to be of high confidence. 
 We present the relational database EDULISS (EDinburgh University Ligand Selection System), which stores structural, physicochemical and pharmacophoric properties of small molecules. The database comprises a collection of over 4 million commercially available compounds from 28 different suppliers. A user-friendly web-based interface for EDULISS (available at http://eduliss.bch.ed.ac.uk/ ) has been established providing a number of data-mining possibilities. For each compound a single 3D conformer is stored along with over 1600 calculated descriptor values (molecular properties). A very efficient method for unique compound recognition, especially for a large scale database, is demonstrated by making use of small subgroups of the descriptors. Many of the shape and distance descriptors are held as pre-calculated bit strings permitting fast and efficient similarity and pharmacophore searches which can be used to identify families of related compounds for biological testing. Two ligand searching applications are given to demonstrate how EDULISS can be used to extract families of molecules with selected structural and biophysical features. 
 We updated the tRNADB-CE by analyzing 939 complete and 1301 draft genomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, 171 complete virus genomes, 121 complete chloroplast genomes and approximately 230 million sequences obtained by metagenome analyses of 210 environmental samples. The 287 102 tRNA genes in total, and thus two times of the tRNA genes compiled previously, are compiled, in which sequence information, clover-leaf structure and results of sequence similarity and oligonucleotide-pattern search can be browsed. In order to pool collective knowledge with help from any experts in the tRNA research field, we included a column to which comments can be added on each tRNA gene. By compiling tRNAs of known prokaryotes with identical sequences, we found high phylogenetic preservation of tRNA sequences, especially at a phylum level. Furthermore, a large number of tRNAs obtained by metagenome analyses of environmental samples had sequences identical to those found in known prokaryotes. The identical sequence group, therefore, can be used as phylogenetic markers to clarify the microbial community structure of an ecosystem. The updated tRNADB-CE provided functions, with which users can obtain the phylotype-specific markers (e.g. genus-specific markers) by themselves and clarify microbial community structures of ecosystems in detail. tRNADB-CE can be accessed freely at http://trna.nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp . 
The Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe; pdbe.org) is actively involved in managing the international archive of biomacromolecular structure data as one of the partners in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB; wwpdb.org). PDBe also develops new tools to make structural data more widely and more easily available to the biomedical community. PDBe has developed a browser to access and analyze the structural archive using classification systems that are familiar to chemists and biologists. The PDBe web pages that describe individual PDB entries have been enhanced through the introduction of plain-English summary pages and iconic representations of the contents of an entry (PDBprints). In addition, the information available for structures determined by means of NMR spectroscopy has been expanded. Finally, the entire web site has been redesigned to make it substantially easier to use for expert and novice users alike. PDBe works closely with other teams at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and in the international scientific community to develop new resources with value-added information. The SIFTS initiative is an example of such a collaboration—it provides extensive mapping data between proteins whose structures are available from the PDB and a host of other biomedical databases. SIFTS is widely used by major bioinformatics resources.
 FlyFactorSurvey (http://pgfe.umassmed.edu/TFDBS/) is a database of DNA binding specificities for Drosophila transcription factors (TFs) primarily determined using the bacterial one-hybrid system. The database provides community access to over 400 recognition motifs and position weight matrices for over 200 TFs, including many unpublished motifs. Search tools and flat file downloads are provided to retrieve binding site information (as sequences, matrices and sequence logos) for individual TFs, groups of TFs or for all TFs with characterized binding specificities. Linked analysis tools allow users to identify motifs within our database that share similarity to a query matrix or to view the distribution of occurrences of an individual motif throughout the Drosophila genome. Together, this database and its associated tools provide computational and experimental biologists with resources to predict interactions between Drosophila TFs and target cis -regulatory sequences. 
 miRBase is the primary online repository for all microRNA sequences and annotation. The current release (miRBase 16) contains over 15 000 microRNA gene loci in over 140 species, and over 17 000 distinct mature microRNA sequences. Deep-sequencing technologies have delivered a sharp rise in the rate of novel microRNA discovery. We have mapped reads from short RNA deep-sequencing experiments to microRNAs in miRBase and developed web interfaces to view these mappings. The user can view all read data associated with a given microRNA annotation, filter reads by experiment and count, and search for microRNAs by tissue- and stage-specific expression. These data can be used as a proxy for relative expression levels of microRNA sequences, provide detailed evidence for microRNA annotations and alternative isoforms of mature microRNAs, and allow us to revisit previous annotations. miRBase is available online at: http://www.mirbase.org/ . 
 Phytohormone studies enlightened our knowledge of plant responses to various changes. To provide a systematic and comprehensive view of genes participating in plant hormonal regulation, an online accessible database Arabidopsis Hormone Database (AHD) has been developed, which is a collection of hormone related genes of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana (AHRGs). Recently we updated our database from AHD to a new version AHD2.0 by adding several pronounced features: (i) updating our collection of AHRGs based on most recent publications as well as constructing elaborate schematic diagrams of each hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways; (ii) adding orthologs of sequenced plants listed in OrthoMCL-DB to each AHRG in the updated database; (iii) providing predicted miRNA splicing site(s) for each AHRG; (iv) integrating genes that genetically interact with each AHRG according to literatures mining; (v) providing links to a powerful online analysis platform WebLab for the convenience of in-time bioinformatics analysis and (vi) providing links to widely used protein databases and integrating more expression profiling information that would facilitate users for a more systematic and integrative analysis related to phytohormone research. 
 The BRENDA (BRaunschweig ENzyme Database, http://www.brenda-enzymes.org ) enzyme information system is the main collection of enzyme functional and property data for the scientific community. The majority of the data are manually extracted from the primary literature. The content covers information on function, structure, occurrence, preparation and application of enzymes as well as properties of mutants and engineered variants. The number of manually annotated references increased by 30% to more than 100 000, the number of ligand structures by 45% to almost 100 000. New query, analysis and data management tools were implemented to improve data processing, data presentation, data input and data access. BRENDA now provides new viewing options such as the display of the statistics of functional parameters and the 3D view of protein sequence and structure features. Furthermore a ligand summary shows comprehensive information on the BRENDA ligands. The enzymes are linked to their respective pathways and can be viewed in pathway maps. The disease text mining part is strongly enhanced. It is possible to submit new, not yet classified enzymes to BRENDA, which then are reviewed and classified by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. A new SBML output format of BRENDA kinetic data allows the construction of organism-specific metabolic models. 
 Protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial regulatory roles in intracellular signal transduction. With the increasing number of experimental phosphorylation sites that has been identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the desire to explore the networks of protein kinases and substrates is motivated. Manning et al. have identified 518 human kinase genes, which provide a starting point for comprehensive analysis of protein phosphorylation networks. In this study, a knowledgebase is developed to integrate experimentally verified protein phosphorylation data and protein–protein interaction data for constructing the protein kinase–substrate phosphorylation networks in human. A total of 21 110 experimental verified phosphorylation sites within 5092 human proteins are collected. However, only 4138 phosphorylation sites (∼20%) have the annotation of catalytic kinases from public domain. In order to fully investigate how protein kinases regulate the intracellular processes, a published kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction tool, named KinasePhos is incorporated for assigning the potential kinase. The web-based system, RegPhos, can let users input a group of human proteins; consequently, the phosphorylation network associated with the protein subcellular localization can be explored. Additionally, time-coursed microarray expression data is subsequently used to represent the degree of similarity in the expression profiles of network members. A case study demonstrates that the proposed scheme not only identify the correct network of insulin signaling but also detect a novel signaling pathway that may cross-talk with insulin signaling network. This effective system is now freely available at http://RegPhos.mbc.nctu.edu.tw . 
 LocDB is a manually curated database with experimental annotations for the subcellular localizations of proteins in Homo sapiens (HS, human) and Arabidopsis thaliana (AT, thale cress). Currently, it contains entries for 19 604 UniProt proteins (HS: 13 342; AT: 6262). Each database entry contains the experimentally derived localization in Gene Ontology (GO) terminology, the experimental annotation of localization, localization predictions by state-of-the-art methods and, where available, the type of experimental information. LocDB is searchable by keyword, protein name and subcellular compartment, as well as by identifiers from UniProt, Ensembl and TAIR resources. In comparison to other public databases, LocDB as a resource adds about 10 000 experimental localization annotations for HS proteins and ∼900 for AS proteins. Over 40% of the proteins in LocDB have multiple localization annotations providing a better platform for development of new multiple localization prediction methods with higher coverage and accuracy. Links to all referenced databases are provided. LocDB will be updated regularly by our group (available at: http://www.rostlab.org/services/locDB ). 
 Correlations of gene-to-gene co-expression and metabolite-to-metabolite co-accumulation calculated from large amounts of transcriptome and metabolome data are useful for uncovering unknown functions of genes, functional diversities of gene family members and regulatory mechanisms of metabolic pathway flows. Many databases and tools are available to interpret quantitative transcriptome and metabolome data, but there are only limited ones that connect correlation data to biological knowledge and can be utilized to find biological significance of it. We report here a new metabolic pathway database, KaPPA-View4 ( http://kpv.kazusa.or.jp/kpv4/ ), which is able to overlay gene-to-gene and/or metabolite-to-metabolite relationships as curves on a metabolic pathway map, or on a combination of up to four maps. This representation would help to discover, for example, novel functions of a transcription factor that regulates genes on a metabolic pathway. Pathway maps of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and maps generated from their gene classifications are available at KaPPA-View4 KEGG version ( http://kpv.kazusa.or.jp/kpv4-kegg/ ). At present, gene co-expression data from the databases ATTED-II, COXPRESdb, CoP and MiBASE for human, mouse, rat, Arabidopsis , rice, tomato and other plants are available. 
 The Hymenoptera Genome Database (HGD) is a comprehensive model organism database that caters to the needs of scientists working on insect species of the order Hymenoptera. This system implements open-source software and relational databases providing access to curated data contributed by an extensive, active research community. HGD contains data from 9 different species across ∼200 million years in the phylogeny of Hymenoptera, allowing researchers to leverage genetic, genome sequence and gene expression data, as well as the biological knowledge of related model organisms. The availability of resources across an order greatly facilitates comparative genomics and enhances our understanding of the biology of agriculturally important Hymenoptera species through genomics. Curated data at HGD includes predicted and annotated gene sets supported with evidence tracks such as ESTs/cDNAs, small RNA sequences and GC composition domains. Data at HGD can be queried using genome browsers and/or BLAST/PSI-BLAST servers, and it may also be downloaded to perform local searches. We encourage the public to access and contribute data to HGD at: http://HymenopteraGenome.org . 
 The V oltage-gated K+C hannel D ata B ase (VKCDB) ( http://vkcdb.biology.ualberta.ca ) makes a comprehensive set of sequence data readily available for phylogenetic and comparative analysis. The current update contains 2063 entries for full-length or nearly full-length unique channel sequences from Bacteria (477), Archaea (18) and Eukaryotes (1568), an increase from 346 solely eukaryotic entries in the original release. In addition to protein sequences for channels, corresponding nucleotide sequences of the open reading frames corresponding to the amino acid sequences are now available and can be extracted in parallel with sets of protein sequences. Channels are categorized into subfamilies by phylogenetic analysis and by using hidden Markov model analyses. Although the raw database contains a number of fragmentary, duplicated, obsolete and non-channel sequences that were collected in early steps of data collection, the web interface will only return entries that have been validated as likely K + channels. The retrieval function of the web interface allows retrieval of entries that contain a substantial fraction of the core structural elements of VKCs, fragmentary entries, or both. The full database can be downloaded as either a MySQL dump or as an XML dump from the web site. We have now implemented automated updates at quarterly intervals. 
 Most proteins from higher organisms are known to be multi-domain proteins and contain substantial numbers of intrinsically disordered (ID) regions. To analyse such protein sequences, those from human for instance, we developed a special protein-structure-prediction pipeline and accumulated the products in the Structure Atlas of Human Genome (SAHG) database at http://bird.cbrc.jp/sahg . With the pipeline, human proteins were examined by local alignment methods (BLAST, PSI-BLAST and Smith–Waterman profile–profile alignment), global–local alignment methods (FORTE) and prediction tools for ID regions (POODLE-S) and homology modeling (MODELLER). Conformational changes of protein models upon ligand-binding were predicted by simultaneous modeling using templates of apo and holo forms. When there were no suitable templates for holo forms and the apo models were accurate, we prepared holo models using prediction methods for ligand-binding (eF-seek) and conformational change (the elastic network model and the linear response theory). Models are displayed as animated images. As of July 2010, SAHG contains 42 581 protein-domain models in approximately 24 900 unique human protein sequences from the RefSeq database. Annotation of models with functional information and links to other databases such as EzCatDB, InterPro or HPRD are also provided to facilitate understanding the protein structure-function relationships. 
 The Phospho.ELM resource ( http://phospho.elm.eu.org ) is a relational database designed to store in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation data extracted from the scientific literature and phosphoproteomic analyses. The resource has been actively developed for more than 7 years and currently comprises 42 574 serine, threonine and tyrosine non-redundant phosphorylation sites. Several new features have been implemented, such as structural disorder/order and accessibility information and a conservation score. Additionally, the conservation of the phosphosites can now be visualized directly on the multiple sequence alignment used for the score calculation. Finally, special emphasis has been put on linking to external resources such as interaction networks and other databases. 
Pseudomonas is a metabolically-diverse genus of bacteria known for its flexibility and leading free living to pathogenic lifestyles in a wide range of hosts. The Pseudomonas Genome Database ( http://www.pseudomonas.com ) integrates completely-sequenced Pseudomonas genome sequences and their annotations with genome-scale, high-precision computational predictions and manually curated annotation updates. The latest release implements an ability to view sequence polymorphisms in P. aeruginosa PAO1 versus other reference strains, incomplete genomes and single gene sequences. This aids analysis of phenotypic variation between closely related isolates and strains, as well as wider population genomics and evolutionary studies. The wide range of tools for comparing Pseudomonas annotations and sequences now includes a strain-specific access point for viewing high precision computational predictions including updated, more accurate, protein subcellular localization and genomic island predictions. Views link to genome-scale experimental data as well as comparative genomics analyses that incorporate robust genera-geared methods for predicting and clustering orthologs. These analyses can be exploited for identifying putative essential and core Pseudomonas genes or identifying large-scale evolutionary events. The Pseudomonas Genome Database aims to provide a continually updated, high quality source of genome annotations, specifically tailored for Pseudomonas researchers, but using an approach that may be implemented for other genera-level research communities. 
 The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ, http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp ) provides a nucleotide sequence archive database and accompanying database tools for sequence submission, entry retrieval and annotation analysis. The DDBJ collected and released 3 637 446 entries/2 272 231 889 bases between July 2009 and June 2010. A highlight of the released data was archive datasets from next-generation sequencing reads of Japanese rice cultivar, Koshihikari submitted by the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences. In this period, we started a new archive for quantitative genomics data, the DDBJ Omics aRchive (DOR). The DOR stores quantitative data both from the microarray and high-throughput new sequencing platforms. Moreover, we improved the content of the DDBJ patent sequence, released a new submission tool of the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA) which archives massive raw sequencing reads, and enhanced a cloud computing-based analytical system from sequencing reads, the DDBJ Read Annotation Pipeline. In this article, we describe these new functions of the DDBJ databases and support tools. 
 The MIPS Fusarium graminearum Genome Database (FGDB) was established as a comprehensive genome database on one of the most devastating fungal plant pathogens of wheat, barley and maize. The current version of FGDB v3.1 provides information on the full manually revised gene set based on the Broad Institute assembly FG3 genome sequence. The results of gene prediction tools were integrated with the help of comparative data on related species to result in a set of 13.718 annotated protein coding genes. This rigorous approach involved adding or modifying gene models and represents a coding sequence gold standard for the genus Fusarium . The gene loci improvements results in 2461 genes which either are new or have different structures compared to the Broad Institute assembly 3 gene set. Moreover the database serves as a convenient entry point to explore expression data results and to obtain information on the Affymetrix GeneChip probe sets. The resource is accessible on http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/FGDB/ . 
m icroRNA expression and sequence analysis database ( http://konulab.fen.bilkent.edu.tr/mirna/ ) (mESAdb) is a regularly updated database for the multivariate analysis of sequences and expression of microRNAs from multiple taxa. mESAdb is modular and has a user interface implemented in PHP and JavaScript and coupled with statistical analysis and visualization packages written for the R language. The database primarily comprises mature microRNA sequences and their target data, along with selected human, mouse and zebrafish expression data sets. mESAdb analysis modules allow (i) mining of microRNA expression data sets for subsets of microRNAs selected manually or by motif; (ii) pair-wise multivariate analysis of expression data sets within and between taxa; and (iii) association of microRNA subsets with annotation databases, HUGE Navigator, KEGG and GO. The use of existing and customized R packages facilitates future addition of data sets and analysis tools. Furthermore, the ability to upload and analyze user-specified data sets makes mESAdb an interactive and expandable analysis tool for microRNA sequence and expression data. 
 Stem cell biology has experienced explosive growth over the past decade as researchers attempt to generate therapeutically relevant cell types in the laboratory. Recapitulation of endogenous developmental trajectories is a dominant paradigm in the design of directed differentiation protocols, and attempts to guide stem cell differentiation are often based explicitly on knowledge of in vivo development. Therefore, when designing protocols, stem cell biologists rely heavily upon information including (i) cell type-specific gene expression profiles, (ii) anatomical and developmental relationships between cells and tissues and (iii) signals important for progression from progenitors to target cell types. Here, we present the Stem Cell Lineage Database (SCLD) ( http://scld.mcb.uconn.edu ) that aims to unify this information into a single resource where users can easily store and access information about cell type gene expression, cell lineage maps and stem cell differentiation protocols for both human and mouse stem cells and endogenous developmental lineages. By establishing the SCLD, we provide scientists with a centralized location to organize access and share data, dispute and resolve contentious relationships between cell types and within lineages, uncover discriminating cell type marker panels and design directed differentiation protocols. 
 By broad literature survey, we have developed a leaf senescence database (LSD, http://www.eplantsenescence.org/ ) that contains a total of 1145 senescence associated genes (SAGs) from 21 species. These SAGs were retrieved based on genetic, genomic, proteomic, physiological or other experimental evidence, and were classified into different categories according to their functions in leaf senescence or morphological phenotypes when mutated. We made extensive annotations for these SAGs by both manual and computational approaches, and users can either browse or search the database to obtain information including literatures, mutants, phenotypes, expression profiles, miRNA interactions, orthologs in other plants and cross links to other databases. We have also integrated a bioinformatics analysis platform WebLab into LSD, which allows users to perform extensive sequence analysis of their interested SAGs. The SAG sequences in LSD can also be downloaded readily for bulk analysis. We believe that the LSD contains the largest number of SAGs to date and represents the most comprehensive and informative plant senescence-related database, which would facilitate the systems biology research and comparative studies on plant aging. 
 miRGator is an integrated database of microRNA (miRNA)-associated gene expression, target prediction, disease association and genomic annotation, which aims to facilitate functional investigation of miRNAs. The recent version of miRGator v2.0 contains information about (i) human miRNA expression profiles under various experimental conditions, (ii) paired expression profiles of both mRNAs and miRNAs, (iii) gene expression profiles under miRNA-perturbation (e.g. miRNA knockout and overexpression), (iv) known/predicted miRNA targets and (v) miRNA-disease associations. In total, >8000 miRNA expression profiles, ∼300 miRNA-perturbed gene expression profiles and ∼2000 mRNA expression profiles are compiled with manually curated annotations on disease, tissue type and perturbation. By integrating these data sets, a series of novel associations (miRNA–miRNA, miRNA–disease and miRNA–target) is extracted via shared features. For example, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after miRNA knockout were systematically compared against miRNA targets. Likewise, differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) were compared with disease-associated miRNAs. Additionally, miRNA expression and disease-phenotype profiles revealed miRNA pairs whose expression was regulated in parallel in various experimental and disease conditions. Complex associations are readily accessible using an interactive network visualization interface. The miRGator v2.0 serves as a reference database to investigate miRNA expression and function ( http://miRGator.kobic.re.kr ). 
 The National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) is implementing the NIAS Genebank Project for conservation and promotion of agrobiological genetic resources to contribute to the development and utilization of agriculture and agricultural products. The project’s databases (NIASGBdb; http://www.gene.affrc.go.jp/databases_en.php ) consist of a genetic resource database and a plant diseases database, linked by a web retrieval database. The genetic resources database has plant and microorganism search systems to provide information on research materials, including passport and evaluation data for genetic resources with the desired properties. To facilitate genetic diversity research, several NIAS Core Collections have been developed. The NIAS Rice ( Oryza sativa ) Core Collection of Japanese Landraces contains information on simple sequence repeat (SSR) polymorphisms. SSR marker information for azuki bean ( Vigna angularis ) and black gram ( V. mungo ) and DNA sequence data from some selected Japanese strains of the genus Fusarium are also available. A database of plant diseases in Japan has been developed based on the listing of common names of plant diseases compiled by the Phytopathological Society of Japan. Relevant plant and microorganism genetic resources are associated with the plant disease names by the web retrieval database and can be obtained from the NIAS Genebank for research or educational purposes. 
 Phospho3D is a database of three-dimensional (3D) structures of phosphorylation sites (P-sites) derived from the Phospho.ELM database, which also collects information on the residues surrounding the P-site in space (3D zones ). The database also provides the results of a large-scale structural comparison of the 3D zones versus a representative dataset of structures, thus associating to each P-site a number of structurally similar sites. The new version of Phospho3D presents an 11-fold increase in the number of 3D sites and incorporates several additional features, including new structural descriptors, the possibility of selecting non-redundant sets of 3D structures and the availability for download of non-redundant sets of structurally annotated P-sites. Moreover, it features P3Dscan, a new functionality that allows the user to submit a protein structure and scan it against the 3D zones collected in the Phospho3D database. Phospho3D version 2.0 is available at: http://www.phospho3d.org/ . 
 Entrez Gene ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene ) is National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)’s database for gene-specific information. Entrez Gene maintains records from genomes which have been completely sequenced, which have an active research community to submit gene-specific information, or which are scheduled for intense sequence analysis. The content represents the integration of curation and automated processing from NCBI’s Reference Sequence project (RefSeq), collaborating model organism databases, consortia such as Gene Ontology and other databases within NCBI. Records in Entrez Gene are assigned unique, stable and tracked integers as identifiers. The content (nomenclature, genomic location, gene products and their attributes, markers, phenotypes and links to citations, sequences, variation details, maps, expression, homologs, protein domains and external databases) is available via interactive browsing through NCBI’s Entrez system, via NCBI’s Entrez programming utilities (E-Utilities) and for bulk transfer by FTP. 
 The Protein–RNA Interface Database (PRIDB) is a comprehensive database of protein–RNA interfaces extracted from complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It is designed to facilitate detailed analyses of individual protein–RNA complexes and their interfaces, in addition to automated generation of user-defined data sets of protein–RNA interfaces for statistical analyses and machine learning applications. For any chosen PDB complex or list of complexes, PRIDB rapidly displays interfacial amino acids and ribonucleotides within the primary sequences of the interacting protein and RNA chains. PRIDB also identifies ProSite motifs in protein chains and FR3D motifs in RNA chains and provides links to these external databases, as well as to structure files in the PDB. An integrated JMol applet is provided for visualization of interacting atoms and residues in the context of the 3D complex structures. The current version of PRIDB contains structural information regarding 926 protein–RNA complexes available in the PDB (as of 10 October 2010). Atomic- and residue-level contact information for the entire data set can be downloaded in a simple machine-readable format. Also, several non-redundant benchmark data sets of protein–RNA complexes are provided. The PRIDB database is freely available online at http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu/PRIDB . 
 It is 12 years since the IMGT/HLA database was first released, providing the HLA community with a searchable repository of highly curated HLA sequences. The HLA complex is located within the 6p21.3 region of human chromosome 6 and contains more than 220 genes of diverse function. Many of the genes encode proteins of the immune system and are highly polymorphic. The naming of these HLA genes and alleles and their quality control is the responsibility of the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System. Through the work of the HLA Informatics Group and in collaboration with the European Bioinformatics Institute, we are able to provide public access to this data through the web site http://www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/hla/ . Regular updates to the web site ensure that new and confirmatory sequences are dispersed to the HLA community, and the wider research and clinical communities. 
 This article introduces the second release of the Gypsy Database of Mobile Genetic Elements (GyDB 2.0): a research project devoted to the evolutionary dynamics of viruses and transposable elements based on their phylogenetic classification (per lineage and protein domain). The Gypsy Database (GyDB) is a long-term project that is continuously progressing, and that owing to the high molecular diversity of mobile elements requires to be completed in several stages. GyDB 2.0 has been powered with a wiki to allow other researchers participate in the project. The current database stage and scope are long terminal repeats (LTR) retroelements and relatives. GyDB 2.0 is an update based on the analysis of Ty3/Gypsy , Retroviridae , Ty1/Copia and Bel/Pao LTR retroelements and the Caulimoviridae pararetroviruses of plants. Among other features, in terms of the aforementioned topics, this update adds: (i) a variety of descriptions and reviews distributed in multiple web pages; (ii) protein-based phylogenies, where phylogenetic levels are assigned to distinct classified elements; (iii) a collection of multiple alignments, lineage-specific hidden Markov models and consensus sequences, called GyDB collection; (iv) updated RefSeq databases and BLAST and HMM servers to facilitate sequence characterization of new LTR retroelement and caulimovirus queries; and (v) a bibliographic server. GyDB 2.0 is available at http://gydb.org.
The present article proposes the adoption of a community-defined, uniform, generic description of the core attributes of biological databases, BioDBCore. The goals of these attributes are to provide a general overview of the database landscape, to encourage consistency and interoperability between resources and to promote the use of semantic and syntactic standards. BioDBCore will make it easier for users to evaluate the scope and relevance of available resources. This new resource will increase the collective impact of the information present in biological databases.
 MicroRNAs (miRNAs), one type of small RNAs (sRNAs) in plants, play an essential role in gene regulation. Several miRNA databases were established; however, successively generated new datasets need to be collected, organized and analyzed. To this end, we have constructed a plant miRNA knowledge base (PmiRKB) that provides four major functional modules. In the ‘SNP’ module, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of seven Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) accessions and 21 rice ( Oryza sativa ) subspecies were collected to inspect the SNPs within pre-miRNAs (precursor microRNAs) and miRNA—target RNA duplexes. Depending on their locations, SNPs can affect the secondary structures of pre-miRNAs, or interactions between miRNAs and their targets. A second module, ‘Pri-miR’, can be used to investigate the tissue-specific, transcriptional contexts of pre- and pri-miRNAs (primary microRNAs), based on massively parallel signature sequencing data. The third module, ‘MiR–Tar’, was designed to validate thousands of miRNA—target pairs by using parallel analysis of RNA end (PARE) data. Correspondingly, the fourth module, ‘Self-reg’, also used PARE data to investigate the metabolism of miRNA precursors, including precursor processing and miRNA- or miRNA*-mediated self-regulation effects on their host precursors. PmiRKB can be freely accessed at http://bis.zju.edu.cn/pmirkb/ . 
 The primary mission of Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biological research by maintaining a stable, comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase, with extensive cross-references and querying interfaces freely accessible to the scientific community. UniProt is produced by the UniProt Consortium which consists of groups from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) and the Protein Information Resource (PIR). UniProt is comprised of four major components, each optimized for different uses: the UniProt Archive, the UniProt Knowledgebase, the UniProt Reference Clusters and the UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental Sequence Database. UniProt is updated and distributed every 4 weeks and can be accessed online for searches or download at http://www.uniprot.org . 
The information of protein targets and small molecule has been highly valued by biomedical and pharmaceutical research. Several protein target databases are available online for FDA-approved drugs as well as the promising precursors that have largely facilitated the mechanistic study and subsequent research for drug discovery. However, those related resources regarding to herbal active ingredients, although being unusually valued as a precious resource for new drug development, is rarely found. In this article, a comprehensive and fully curated database for Herb Ingredients’ Targets (HIT, http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/hit/) has been constructed to complement above resources. Those herbal ingredients with protein target information were carefully curated. The molecular target information involves those proteins being directly/indirectly activated/inhibited, protein binders and enzymes whose substrates or products are those compounds. Those up/down regulated genes are also included under the treatment of individual ingredients. In addition, the experimental condition, observed bioactivity and various references are provided as well for user's reference. Derived from more than 3250 literatures, it currently contains 5208 entries about 1301 known protein targets (221 of them are described as direct targets) affected by 586 herbal compounds from more than 1300 reputable Chinese herbs, overlapping with 280 therapeutic targets from Therapeutic Targets Database (TTD), and 445 protein targets from DrugBank corresponding to 1488 drug agents. The database can be queried via keyword search or similarity search. Crosslinks have been made to TTD, DrugBank, KEGG, PDB, Uniprot, Pfam, NCBI, TCM-ID and other databases.
 The RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) web site ( http://www.pdb.org ) has been redesigned to increase usability and to cater to a larger and more diverse user base. This article describes key enhancements and new features that fall into the following categories: (i) query and analysis tools for chemical structure searching, query refinement, tabulation and export of query results; (ii) web site customization and new structure alerts; (iii) pair-wise and representative protein structure alignments; (iv) visualization of large assemblies; (v) integration of structural data with the open access literature and binding affinity data; and (vi) web services and web widgets to facilitate integration of PDB data and tools with other resources. These improvements enable a range of new possibilities to analyze and understand structure data. The next generation of the RCSB PDB web site, as described here, provides a rich resource for research and education. 
 The procedure of drug approval is time-consuming, costly and risky. Accidental findings regarding multi-specificity of approved drugs led to block-busters in new indication areas. Therefore, the interest in systematically elucidating new areas of application for known drugs is rising. Furthermore, the knowledge, understanding and prediction of so-called off-target effects allow a rational approach to the understanding of side-effects. With PROMISCUOUS we provide an exhaustive set of drugs (25 000), including withdrawn or experimental drugs, annotated with drug–protein and protein–protein relationships (21 500/104 000) compiled from public resources via text and data mining including manual curation. Measures of structural similarity for drugs as well as known side-effects can be easily connected to protein–protein interactions to establish and analyse networks responsible for multi-pharmacology. This network-based approach can provide a starting point for drug-repositioning. PROMISCUOUS is publicly available at http://bioinformatics.charite.de/promiscuous . 
 In addition to maintaining the GenBank® nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides analysis and retrieval resources for the data in GenBank and other biological data made available through the NCBI Web site. NCBI resources include Entrez, the Entrez Programming Utilities, MyNCBI, PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), Entrez Gene, the NCBI Taxonomy Browser, BLAST, BLAST Link (BLink), Primer-BLAST, COBALT, Electronic PCR, OrfFinder, Splign, ProSplign, RefSeq, UniGene, HomoloGene, ProtEST, dbMHC, dbSNP, dbVar, Epigenomics, Cancer Chromosomes, Entrez Genomes and related tools, the Map Viewer, Model Maker, Evidence Viewer, Trace Archive, Sequence Read Archive, Retroviral Genotyping Tools, HIV-1/Human Protein Interaction Database, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Entrez Probe, GENSAT, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA), the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), the Conserved Domain Database (CDD), the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART), IBIS, Biosystems, Peptidome, OMSSA, Protein Clusters and the PubChem suite of small molecule databases. Augmenting many of the Web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets. All of these resources can be accessed through the NCBI home page at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . 
 PREX ( http://www.csb.wfu.edu/prex/ ) is a database of currently 3516 peroxiredoxin (Prx or PRDX) protein sequences unambiguously classified into one of six distinct subfamilies. Peroxiredoxins are a diverse and ubiquitous family of highly expressed, cysteine-dependent peroxidases that are important for antioxidant defense and for the regulation of cell signaling pathways in eukaryotes. Subfamily members were identified using the Deacon Active Site Profiler (DASP) bioinformatics tool to focus in on functionally relevant sequence fragments surrounding key residues required for protein activity. Searches of this database can be conducted by protein annotation, accession number, PDB ID, organism name or protein sequence. Output includes the subfamily to which each classified Prx belongs, accession and GI numbers, genus and species and the functional site signature used for classification. The query sequence is also presented aligned with a select group of Prxs for manual evaluation and interpretation by the user. A synopsis of the characteristics of members of each subfamily is also provided along with pertinent references. 
 The REDfly database of Drosophila transcriptional cis -regulatory elements provides the broadest and most comprehensive available resource for experimentally validated cis -regulatory modules and transcription factor binding sites among the metazoa. The third major release of the database extends the utility of REDfly as a powerful tool for both computational and experimental studies of transcription regulation. REDfly v3.0 includes the introduction of new data classes to expand the types of regulatory elements annotated in the database along with a roughly 40% increase in the number of records. A completely redesigned interface improves access for casual and power users alike; among other features it now automatically provides graphical views of the genome, displays images of reporter gene expression and implements improved capabilities for database searching and results filtering. REDfly is freely accessible at http://redfly.ccr.buffalo.edu . 
 The growing availability of complete genomic sequences from diverse species has brought about the need to scale up phylogenomic analyses, including the reconstruction of large collections of phylogenetic trees. Here, we present the third version of PhylomeDB ( http://phylomeDB.org ), a public database for genome-wide collections of gene phylogenies (phylomes). Currently, PhylomeDB is the largest phylogenetic repository and hosts 17 phylomes, comprising 416 093 trees and 165 840 alignments. It is also a major source for phylogeny-based orthology and paralogy predictions, covering about 5 million proteins in 717 fully-sequenced genomes. For each protein-coding gene in a seed genome, the database provides original and processed alignments, phylogenetic trees derived from various methods and phylogeny-based predictions of orthology and paralogy relationships. The new version of phylomeDB has been extended with novel data access and visualization features, including the possibility of programmatic access. Available seed species include model organisms such as human, yeast, Escherichia coli or Arabidopsis thaliana , but also alternative model species such as the human pathogen Candida albicans , or the pea aphid Acyrtosiphon pisum . Finally, PhylomeDB is currently being used by several genome sequencing projects that couple the genome annotation process with the reconstruction of the corresponding phylome, a strategy that provides relevant evolutionary insights. 
 The Pancreatic Expression database (PED, http://www.pancreasexpression.org ) has established itself as the main repository for pancreatic-derived -omics data. For the past 3 years, its data content and access have increased substantially. Here we describe several of its new and improved features, such as data content, which now includes over 60 000 measurements derived from transcriptomics, proteomics, genomics and miRNA profiles from various pancreas-centred reports on a broad range of specimen and experimental types. We also illustrate the capabilities of its interface, which allows integrative queries that can combine PED data with a growing number of biological resources such as NCBI, Ensembl, UniProt and Reactome. Thus, PED is capable of retrieving and integrating different types of -omics, annotations and clinical data. We also focus on the importance of data sharing and interoperability in the cancer field, and the integration of PED into the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data portal. 
 Now in its 10th year, the Gramene database ( http://www.gramene.org ) has grown from its primary focus on rice, the first fully-sequenced grass genome, to become a resource for major model and crop plants including Arabidopsis , Brachypodium , maize, sorghum, poplar and grape in addition to several species of rice. Gramene began with the addition of an Ensembl genome browser and has expanded in the last decade to become a robust resource for plant genomics hosting a wide array of data sets including quantitative trait loci (QTL), metabolic pathways, genetic diversity, genes, proteins, germplasm, literature, ontologies and a fully-structured markers and sequences database integrated with genome browsers and maps from various published studies (genetic, physical, bin, etc.). In addition, Gramene now hosts a variety of web services including a Distributed Annotation Server (DAS), BLAST and a public MySQL database. Twice a year, Gramene releases a major build of the database and makes interim releases to correct errors or to make important updates to software and/or data. 
 A vast number of sweet tasting molecules are known, encompassing small compounds, carbohydrates, d -amino acids and large proteins. Carbohydrates play a particularly big role in human diet. The replacement of sugars in food with artificial sweeteners is common and is a general approach to prevent cavities, obesity and associated diseases such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Knowledge about the molecular basis of taste may reveal new strategies to overcome diet-induced diseases. In this context, the design of safe, low-calorie sweeteners is particularly important. Here, we provide a comprehensive collection of carbohydrates, artificial sweeteners and other sweet tasting agents like proteins and peptides. Additionally, structural information and properties such as number of calories, therapeutic annotations and a sweetness-index are stored in SuperSweet. Currently, the database consists of more than 8000 sweet molecules. Moreover, the database provides a modeled 3D structure of the sweet taste receptor and binding poses of the small sweet molecules. These binding poses provide hints for the design of new sweeteners. A user-friendly graphical interface allows similarity searching, visualization of docked sweeteners into the receptor etc. A sweetener classification tree and browsing features allow quick requests to be made to the database. The database is freely available at: http://bioinformatics.charite.de/sweet/ . 
 The stability, localization and translation rate of mRNAs are regulated by a multitude of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that find their targets directly or with the help of guide RNAs. Among the experimental methods for mapping RBP binding sites, cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) coupled with deep sequencing provides transcriptome-wide coverage as well as high resolution. However, partly due to their vast volume, the data that were so far generated in CLIP experiments have not been put in a form that enables fast and interactive exploration of binding sites. To address this need, we have developed the CLIPZ database and analysis environment. Binding site data for RBPs such as Argonaute 1-4, Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein 1-3, TNRC6 proteins A-C, Pumilio 2, Quaking and Polypyrimidine tract binding protein can be visualized at the level of the genome and of individual transcripts. Individual users can upload their own sequence data sets while being able to limit the access to these data to specific users, and analyses of the public and private data sets can be performed interactively. CLIPZ, available at http://www.clipz.unibas.ch , aims to provide an open access repository of information for post-transcriptional regulatory elements. 
 COMBREX ( http://combrex.bu.edu ) is a project to increase the speed of the functional annotation of new bacterial and archaeal genomes. It consists of a database of functional predictions produced by computational biologists and a mechanism for experimental biochemists to bid for the validation of those predictions. Small grants are available to support successful bids. 
 The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public resource that promotes understanding about the interaction of environmental chemicals with gene products, and their effects on human health. Biocurators at CTD manually curate a triad of chemical–gene, chemical–disease and gene–disease relationships from the literature. These core data are then integrated to construct chemical–gene–disease networks and to predict many novel relationships using different types of associated data. Since 2009, we dramatically increased the content of CTD to 1.4 million chemical–gene–disease data points and added many features, statistical analyses and analytical tools, including GeneComps and ChemComps (to find comparable genes and chemicals that share toxicogenomic profiles), enriched Gene Ontology terms associated with chemicals, statistically ranked chemical–disease inferences, Venn diagram tools to discover overlapping and unique attributes of any set of chemicals, genes or disease, and enhanced gene pathway data content, among other features. Together, this wealth of expanded chemical–gene–disease data continues to help users generate testable hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms of environmental diseases. CTD is freely available at http://ctd.mdibl.org . 
 The molecular diversity of viruses complicates the interpretation of viral genomic and proteomic data. To make sense of viral gene functions, investigators must be familiar with the virus host range, replication cycle and virion structure. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive resource bridging together textbook knowledge with genomic and proteomic sequences. ViralZone web resource ( www.expasy.org/viralzone/ ) provides fact sheets on all known virus families/genera with easy access to sequence data. A selection of reference strains (RefStrain) provides annotated standards to circumvent the exponential increase of virus sequences. Moreover ViralZone offers a complete set of detailed and accurate virion pictures. 
The Rfam database aims to catalogue non-coding RNAs through the use of sequence alignments and statistical profile models known as covariance models. In this contribution, we discuss the pros and cons of using the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, as a source of community‐derived annotation. We discuss the addition of groupings of related RNA families into clans and new developments to the website. Rfam is available on the Web at http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk.
Domain Interaction MAp (DIMA, available at http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/dima) is a database of predicted and known interactions between protein domains. It integrates 5807 structurally known interactions imported from the iPfam and 3did databases and 46 900 domain interactions predicted by four computational methods: domain phylogenetic profiling, domain pair exclusion algorithm correlated mutations and domain interaction prediction in a discriminative way. Additionally predictions are filtered to exclude those domain pairs that are reported as non-interacting by the Negatome database. The DIMA Web site allows to calculate domain interaction networks either for a domain of interest or for entire organisms, and to explore them interactively using the Flash-based Cytoscape Web software.
The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the world-wide repository of macromolecular structure information. We present a series of databases that run parallel to the PDB. Each database holds one entry, if possible, for each PDB entry. DSSP holds the secondary structure of the proteins. PDBREPORT holds reports on the structure quality and lists errors. HSSP holds a multiple sequence alignment for all proteins. The PDBFINDER holds easy to parse summaries of the PDB file content, augmented with essentials from the other systems. PDB_REDO holds re-refined, and often improved, copies of all structures solved by X-ray. WHY_NOT summarizes why certain files could not be produced. All these systems are updated weekly. The data sets can be used for the analysis of properties of protein structures in areas ranging from structural genomics, to cancer biology and protein design.
 The ArrayExpress Archive ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress ) is one of the three international public repositories of functional genomics data supporting publications. It includes data generated by sequencing or array-based technologies. Data are submitted by users and imported directly from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. The ArrayExpress Archive is closely integrated with the Gene Expression Atlas and the sequence databases at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Advanced queries provided via ontology enabled interfaces include queries based on technology and sample attributes such as disease, cell types and anatomy. 
 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an important class of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) that regulate gene expression by targeting messenger RNAs. However, assigning miRNAs to their regulatory target genes remains technically challenging. Recently, high-throughput CLIP-Seq and degradome sequencing (Degradome-Seq) methods have been applied to identify the sites of Argonaute interaction and miRNA cleavage sites, respectively. In this study, we introduce a novel database, starBase ( s RNA tar get Base ), which we have developed to facilitate the comprehensive exploration of miRNA–target interaction maps from CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq data. The current version includes high-throughput sequencing data generated from 21 CLIP-Seq and 10 Degradome-Seq experiments from six organisms . By analyzing millions of mapped CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq reads, we identified ∼1 million Ago-binding clusters and ∼2 million cleaved target clusters in animals and plants, respectively. Analyses of these clusters, and of target sites predicted by 6 miRNA target prediction programs, resulted in our identification of approximately 400 000 and approximately 66 000 miRNA-target regulatory relationships from CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq data, respectively. Furthermore, two web servers were provided to discover novel miRNA target sites from CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq data. Our web implementation supports diverse query types and exploration of common targets, gene ontologies and pathways. The starBase is available at http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/ . 
 CATH version 3.3 (class, architecture, topology, homology) contains 128 688 domains, 2386 homologous superfamilies and 1233 fold groups, and reflects a major focus on classifying structural genomics (SG) structures and transmembrane proteins, both of which are likely to add structural novelty to the database and therefore increase the coverage of protein fold space within CATH. For CATH version 3.4 we have significantly improved the presentation of sequence information and associated functional information for CATH superfamilies. The CATH superfamily pages now reflect both the functional and structural diversity within the superfamily and include structural alignments of close and distant relatives within the superfamily, annotated with functional information and details of conserved residues. A significantly more efficient search function for CATH has been established by implementing the search server Solr ( http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ ). The CATH v3.4 webpages have been built using the Catalyst web framework.
