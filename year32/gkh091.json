Now, four complete genome sequences recently determined ( Candida glabrata , Kluyveromyces lactis , Debaryomyces hansenii , Yarrowia lipolytica ) have been added to the partial sequences of 13 species previously analysed by a random approach. The database also includes the reference genome Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Data are presented with a focus on relations between genes and genomes: conservation of genes and gene families, speciation, chromosomal reorganization and synteny. The G\u00e9nolevures site includes a community area for specific studies by members of the international community.
