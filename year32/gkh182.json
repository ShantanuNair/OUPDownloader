{"keywords": ["mitochondria", "drosophila", "endoribonucleases", "genes", "transfer rna", "ribonucleases", "rna interference"], "abstract": "Although correct tRNA 3\u2032 ends are crucial for protein biosynthesis, generation of mature tRNA 3\u2032 ends in eukaryotes is poorly understood and has so far only been investigated in vitro. We report here for the first time that eukaryotic tRNA 3\u2032 end maturation is catalysed by the endonuclease RNase Z in vivo. Silencing of the JhI\u20101 gene (RNase Z homolog) in vivo with RNAi in Drosophila S2 cultured cells causes accumulation of nuclear and mitochondrial pre\u2010tRNAs, suggesting that JhI\u20101 encodes both forms of the tRNA 3\u2032 endonuclease RNase Z, and establishing its biological role in endonucleolytic tRNA 3\u2032 end processing. In addition our data show that in vivo 5\u2032 processing of nuclear and mitochondrial pre\u2010tRNAs occurs before 3\u2032 processing.", "authors": ["Edward B. Dubrovsky", "Veronica A.
