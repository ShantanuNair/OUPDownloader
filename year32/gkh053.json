Such events can provide the \u2018Rosetta stone\u2019 in the search for potential protein\u2013protein interactions, as well as metabolic and regulatory networks. However, the false positive rate of this approach may be quite high, prompting a detailed scrutiny of putative gene fusion events. FusionDB readily provides much of the information required for that task. Moreover, FusionDB extends the notion of gene fusion from that of a single gene to that of a family of genes by assembling pairs of genes from different genomes that belong to the same Cluster of Orthogonal Groups (COG). Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree reconstruction for the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal parts of these \u2018COG fusion\u2019 events are provided to distinguish single and multiple fusion events from cases of gene fission, pseudogenes and other false positives. Finally, gene fusion events with matches to known structures of heterodimers in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are identified and may be visualized. FusionDB is fully searchable with access to sequence and alignment data at all levels. A number of different scores are provided to easily differentiate \u2018real\u2019 from \u2018questionable\u2019 cases, especially when larger database searches are performed. FusionDB is cross\u2010linked with the \u2018Phylogenomic Display of Bacterial Genes\u2019 (PhydBac) online web server. Together, these servers provide the complete set of information required for in\u2010depth analysis of non\u2010homology\u2010based gene function attribution.
