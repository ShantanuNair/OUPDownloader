The Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) has long been devoting itself to sequencing, information analysis and biological research of the rice and other crop genomes. In order to facilitate the application of the rice genomic information and to provide a foundation for functional and evolutionary studies of other important cereal crops, we implemented our Rice Information System (BGI\u2010RIS), the most up\u2010to\u2010date integrated information resource as well as a workbench for comparative genomic analysis. In addition to comprehensive data from Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica sequenced by BGI, BGI\u2010RIS also hosts carefully curated genome information from Oryza sativa L. ssp . japonica and EST sequences available from other cereal crops. In this resource, sequence contigs of indica (93\u201011) have been further assembled into Mbp\u2010sized scaffolds and anchored onto the rice chromosomes referenced to physical/genetic markers, cDNAs and BAC\u2010end sequences. We have annotated the rice genomes for gene content, repetitive elements, gene duplications (tandem and segmental) and single nucleotide polymorphisms between rice subspecies. Designed as a basic platform, BGI\u2010RIS presents the sequenced genomes and related information in systematic and graphical ways for the convenience of in\u2010depth comparative studies ( http://rise.genomics.org.cn/ ).
