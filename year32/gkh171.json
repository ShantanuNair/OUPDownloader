In the presence of Npt\u2013Azq, the melting temperature (Tm) of 5\u2032\u2010d(CTA ACG GAA TG)\u20103\u2032/3\u2032\u2010d(GAT TGA CTT AC)\u20105\u2032 containing a single G\u2010A mismatch increased by 15.4\u00b0C, whereas fully matched duplex increased its Tm only by 2.2\u00b0C. Npt\u2013Azq was immobilized on the sensor surface for the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay to examine SPR detection of duplexes containing a G\u2010A mismatch. Distinct SPR signals were observed when 27mer DNA containing a G\u2010A mismatch was analyzed by the Npt\u2013Azq immobilized sensor surfaces, whereas the signal of the fully matched duplex was \u223c6\u2010fold weaker in intensity. The SPR signals for the G\u2010A mismatch were proportional to the concentration of DNA in a range up to 1 \u00b5M, confirming that the SPR signal is in fact due to the binding of the G\u2010A mismatch to Npt\u2013Azq immobilized on the surface. Examination of all 16 G\u2010A mismatches regarding the flanking sequence revealed that the sensor surface reported here is applicable to eight flanking sequences, covering 50% of all possible G\u2010A mismatches.", "authors": ["Shinya Hagihara", "Hiroyuki Kumasawa", "Yuki Goto", "Gosuke Hayashi", "Akio Kobori", "Isao Saito", "Kazuhiko Nakatani"], "about": ["adenine", "dna", "guanine", "naphthyridines", "surface plasmon resonance", "temperature", "sensor", "mismatch", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Detection of guanine\u2013adenine mismatches by surface plasmon resonance sensor carrying naphthyridine\u2013azaquinolone hybrid on the surface\r\n "}
