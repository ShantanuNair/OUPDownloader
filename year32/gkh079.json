{"keywords": ["signal transduction", "eukaryotic cells"], "abstract": " The Signal Transduction Classification Database (STCDB) is a database of information relative to the classification of signal transduction. It is based primarily on a proposed classification of signal transduction and it describes each type of characterized signal transduction for which a unique ST number has been provided. This document presents, in its first version, the classification of signal transduction in eukaryotic cells. Approved classifications are available for web browsing at http://www.techfak.uni\u2010bielefeld.de/\u223cmchen/STCDB .
