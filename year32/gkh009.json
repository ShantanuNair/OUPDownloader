{"keywords": ["aspergillus", "aspergillus fumigatus", "aspergillus nidulans", "genome", "genome, fungal", "housing"], "abstract": " C A DRE is a public resource for housing and analysing genomic data extracted from species of Aspergillus . It arose to enable maintenance of the complete annotated genomic sequence of Aspergillus fumigatus and to provide tools for searching, analysing and visualizing features of fungal genomes. By implementing C A DRE using Ensembl, a framework is in place for storing and comparing several genomes: the resource will thus expand by including other Aspergillus genomes (such as Aspergillus nidulans ) as they become available. C A DRE is accessible at http://www.cadre. man.ac.uk . ", "authors": ["J. E. Mabey", "M. J. Anderson", "P. F. Giles", "C. J. Miller", "T. K. Attwood", "N. W. Paton", "E. Bornberg\u2010Bauer", "G. D.
