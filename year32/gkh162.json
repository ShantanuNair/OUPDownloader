Researchers, therefore, both publish and seek disease\u2010relevant mutations in public databases and in scientific literature, e.g. Medline. The retrieval tends to be time\u2010consuming and incomplete. Automated screening of the literature is more efficient. We developed extraction methods (called MEMA) that scan Medline abstracts for mutations. MEMA identified 24\u2009351 singleton mutations in conjunction with a HUGO gene name out of 16\u2009728 abstracts. From a sample of 100 abstracts we estimated the recall for the identification of mutation\u2013gene pairs to 35% at a precision of 93%. Recall for the mutation detection alone was >67% with a precision rate of >96%. This shows that our system produces reliable data. The subset consisting of protein sequence mutations (PSMs) from MEMA was compared to the entries in OMIM (20 503 entries versus 6699, respectively). We found 1826 PSM\u2013gene pairs to be in common to both datasets (cross\u2010validated). This is 27% of all PSM\u2013gene pairs in OMIM and 91% of those pairs from OMIM which co\u2010occur in at least one Medline abstract. We conclude that Medline covers a large portion of the mutations known to OMIM. Another large portion could be artificially produced mutations from mutagenesis experiments. Access to the database of extracted mutation\u2013gene pairs is available through the web pages of the EBI (refer to http://www.ebi. ac.uk/rebholz/index.html).", "authors": ["Dietrich Rebholz\u2010Schuhmann", "Stephane Marcel", "Sylvie Albert", "Ralf Tolle", "Georg Casari", "Harald Kirsch"], "about": ["mutation", "genes", "medline", "mental recall", "mendelian inheritance in man, online", "precision", "Computational Methods"], "title": "Automatic extraction of mutations from Medline and cross\u2010validation with OMIM\r\n "}
