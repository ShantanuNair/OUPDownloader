Here we study the effect of echinomycin upon DNA replication using egg extracts and embryos from Xenopuslaevis as well as cultured human cells. Evidence is presented that echinomycin interferes with chromatin decondensation, nuclear assembly and DNA replication. In the absence of transcription and translation, the drug specifically blocks DNA replication in both Xenopus sperm chromatin and HeLa cell nuclei invitro. By contrast, replication of single\u2010stranded DNA is not inhibited indicating that echinomycin acts by interacting with the DNA and not the replication elongation proteins of chromatin. The addition of the antibiotic to HeLa cells and X.laevis embryos results in anaphase bridges and cell death. Importantly, in X.laevis embryos injected with echinomycin at the two\u2010cell stage the drug specifically inhibits the cell cycle prior to the onset of transcription, suggesting that quinoxaline antibiotics could exert anti\u2010 proliferative effects by inhibition of chromosomal DNA replication.", "authors": ["Laurence G.
