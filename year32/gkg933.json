Both Ku antigen and NDH II were associated with hnRNP complexes. Two\u2010dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that Ku antigen was most abundantly associated with hnRNP C, K, J, H and F, but apparently not with others, such as hnRNP A1. Unexpectedly, DNA\u2010dependent protein kinase (DNA\u2010PK), which comprises Ku antigen as the DNA binding subunit, phosphorylated hnRNP proteins in an RNA\u2010dependent manner. DNA\u2010PK also phosphorylated recombinant NDH II in the presence of RNA. RNA binding assays displayed a preference of DNA\u2010PK for poly(rG), but not for poly(rA), poly(rC) or poly(rU). This RNA binding affinity of DNA\u2010PK can be ascribed to its Ku86 subunit. Consistently, poly(rG) most strongly stimulated the DNA\u2010PK\u2010catalyzed phosphorylation of NDH II. RNA interference studies revealed that a suppressed expression of NDH II altered the nuclear distribution of hnRNP C, while silencing DNA\u2010PK changed the subnuclear distribution of NDH II and hnRNP C. These results support the view that DNA\u2010PK can also function as an RNA\u2010dependent protein kinase to regulate some aspects of RNA metabolism, such as RNA processing and transport.", "authors": ["Suisheng Zhang", "Bernhard Schlott", "Matthias G\u00f6rlach", "Frank Grosse"], "about": ["rheumatoid arthritis", "metabolism", "immunoprecipitation", "antigens", "gel chromatography", "dna", "hela cells", "phosphorylation", "protein kinase", "rna helicase", "rna processing, post-transcriptional", "russia", "antibodies", "rna", "rna interference", "electrophoresis, gel", "affinity", "nuclear dna", "complex", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "DNA\u2010dependent protein kinase (DNA\u2010PK) phosphorylates nuclear DNA helicase II/RNA helicase A and hnRNP proteins in an RNA\u2010dependent manner\r\n "}
