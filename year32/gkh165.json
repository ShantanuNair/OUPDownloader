{"keywords": ["dna", "nucleotides", "substrate specificity", "endonuclease", "kinetics", "base excision repair"], "abstract": "In nucleotide incision repair (NIR), an endonuclease nicks oxidatively damaged DNA in a DNA glycosylase\u2010independent manner, providing the correct ends for DNA synthesis coupled to the repair of the remaining 5\u2032\u2010dangling modified nucleotide. This mechanistic feature is distinct from DNA glycosylase\u2010mediated base excision repair. Here we report that Ape1, the major apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease in human cells, is the damage\u2010 specific endonuclease involved in NIR. We show that Ape1 incises DNA containing 5,6\u2010dihydro\u20102\u2032\u2010deoxyuridine, 5,6\u2010dihydrothymidine, 5\u2010hydroxy\u20102\u2032\u2010deoxyuridine, alpha\u20102\u2032\u2010deoxyadenosine and alpha\u2010thymidine adducts, generating 3\u2032\u2010hydroxyl and 5\u2032\u2010phosphate termini. The kinetic constants indicate that Ape1\u2010catalysed NIR activity is highly efficient. The substrate specificity and protein conformation of Ape1 is modulated by MgCl2 concentrations, thus providing conditions under which NIR becomes a major activity in cell\u2010free extracts. While the N\u2010terminal region of Ape1 is not required for AP endonuclease function, we show that it regulates the NIR activity. The physiological relevance of the mammalian NIR pathway is discussed.", "authors": ["Laurent Gros", "Alexander A. Ishchenko", "Hiroshi Ide", "Rhoderick H. Elder", "Murat K.
