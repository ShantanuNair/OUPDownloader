{"keywords": ["heterogeneity", "dna, catalytic", "rna", "homogeneity"], "abstract": "Transcription from the commonly used GTP\u2010 initiating T7 class III promoter \u03d56.5 frequently produces heterogeneous RNA at both 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends. We demonstrate here that RNA transcripts from the T7 class II promoter \u03d52.5 have superior 5\u2032 homogeneity over those from the \u03d56.5 promoter, with comparable total RNA yields. The overall homogeneity of RNA transcripts is improved to different degrees depending on RNA sequences, although transcription under \u03d52.5 does not affect the 3\u2032 heterogeneity of RNA. In combination with 3\u2032 RNA trimming by DNAzymes or ribozymes, this ATP\u2010 initiated transcription system based on the T7 \u03d52.5 promoter can provide excellent quality of RNA for applications requiring a high degree of RNA size homogeneity.", "authors": ["Tricia M.
