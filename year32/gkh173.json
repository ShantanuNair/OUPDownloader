{"keywords": ["base pairing", "dna", "crystal structure"], "abstract": "The Escherichia coli SeqA protein recognizes the 11 hemimethylated G\u2010mA\u2010T\u2010C sites in the oriC region of the chromosome, and prevents replication over\u2010initiation within one cell cycle. The crystal structure of the SeqA C\u2010terminal domain with hemimethylated DNA revealed the N6\u2010methyladenine recognition mechanism; however, the mechanism of discrimination between the hemimethylated and fully methylated states has remained elusive. In the present study, we performed mutational analyses of hemimethylated G\u2010mA\u2010T\u2010C sequences with the minimal DNA\u2010binding domain of SeqA (SeqA71\u2013181), and found that SeqA71\u2013181 specifically binds to hemimethylated DNA containing a sequence with a mismatched mA:G base pair [G\u2010mA(:G)\u2010T\u2010C] as efficiently as the normal hemimethylated G\u2010mA(:T)\u2010T\u2010C sequence. We determined the crystal structures of SeqA71\u2013181 complexed with the mismatched and normal hemimethylated DNAs at 2.5 and 3.0 \u00c5 resolutions, respectively, and found that the mismatched mA:G base pair and the normal mA:T base pair are recognized by SeqA in a similar manner. Furthermore, in both crystal structures, an electron density is present near the unmethylated adenine, which is only methylated in the fully methylated state. This electron density, which may be due to a water molecule or a metal ion, can exist in the hemimethylated state, but not in the fully methylated state, because of steric clash with the additional methyl group.", "authors": ["Norie Fujikawa", "Hitoshi Kurumizaka", "Osamu Nureki", "Yoshinori Tanaka", "Mitsuyoshi Yamazoe", "Sota Hiraga", "Shigeyuki Yokoyama"], "about": ["base pairing", "dna", "crystal structure", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Structural and biochemical analyses of hemimethylated DNA binding by the SeqA protein\r\n "}
