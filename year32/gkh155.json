The selectivity of promoter recognition by E\u03c3S and the housekeeping E\u03c370 is as yet not clearly understood. We used a genetic approach to investigate the interaction of \u03c3S with its target promoters. Starting with down\u2010promoter variants of a \u03c3S promoter target, osmEp, altered in the \u201310 or \u201335 elements, we isolated mutant forms of \u03c3S suppressing the promoter defects. The activity of these suppressors on variants of osmEp and ficp, another target of \u03c3S, indicated that \u03c3S is able to interact with the same key features within a promoter sequence as \u03c370. Indeed, (i) \u03c3S can recognize the \u201335 element of some but not all its target promoters, through interactions with its 4.2 region; and (ii) amino acids within the 2.4 region participate in the recognition of the \u201310 element. More specifically, residues Q152 and E155 contribute to the strong preference of \u03c3S for a C in position \u201313 and residue R299 can interact with the \u201331 nucleotide in the \u201335 element of the target promoters.", "authors": ["Claire Checroun", "Patricia Bordes", "Olivier Leroy", "Annie Kolb", "Claude Gutierrez"], "about": ["gene expression", "mutation", "amino acids", "dna-directed rna polymerase", "housekeeping", "nucleotides", "oncogenes", "genetics", "escherichia coli", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Interactions between the 2.4 and 4.2 regions of \u03c3S, the stress\u2010specific \u03c3 factor of Escherichia coli, and the \u201310 and \u201335 promoter elements\r\n "}
