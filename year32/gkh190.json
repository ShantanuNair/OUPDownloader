In Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevesiae and mice, Tg is preferentially excised by endonuclease III (Endo III) and endonuclease VIII (Endo VIII), yNTG1 and yNTG2, and mNTH and mNEIL1, respectively. We have explored the ability of these DNA glycosylases to discriminate between Tg stereoisomers. Oligonucleotides containing a single, chromatographically pure (5S,6R) or (5R,6S) stereoisomer of Tg were prepared by oxidation with osmium tetroxide. Steady\u2010state kinetic analyses of the excision process revealed that Endo III, Endo VIII, yNTG1, mNTH and mNEIL1, but not yNTG2, excise Tg isomers from DNA in a stereoselective manner, as reflected in the parameter of catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). When DNA glycosylases occur as complementary pairs, failure of one or both enzymes to excise their cognate Tg stereoisomer from oxidatively damaged DNA could have deleterious consequences for the cell.", "authors": ["Holly Miller", "Andrea S.
