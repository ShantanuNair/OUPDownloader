The database contains novel candidate imprinted genes identified by the RIKEN full\u2010length mouse cDNA microarray study, information on validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to confirm imprinting using reciprocal mouse crosses and the predicted physical position of imprinting\u2010related disease loci in the mouse and human genomes. It has two user\u2010friendly search interfaces: the SNP\u2010central view (MuSCAT: MoUse SNP CATalog) and the candidate gene\u2010central view (CITE: Candidate Imprinted Transcripts by Expression). The database, EICO (Expression\u2010based Imprint Candidate Organizer), can be accessed via the World Wide Web ( http://fantom2.gsc.riken.jp/EICODB/ ) and the DAS client software. These data and interfaces facilitate understanding of the mechanism of imprinting in mammalian inherited traits.
