{"keywords": ["cisplatin", "dna", "exonuclease", "binding (molecular function)", "dna repair protein"], "abstract": "YB\u20101 is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of transcription, translation, mRNA splicing and probably DNA repair. It contains a conserved cold shock domain and it binds strongly to inverted CCAAT box of different promoters. In this study, we have found that purified YB\u20101 oligomerizes readily in solutions to form trimers, hexamers and oligomers of 12 molecules. The presence of ATP changed the conformation of YB\u20101 in such a way that only dimers were detected by gel filtration analyses. Purified YB\u20101 can separate different DNA duplexes containing blunt ends, 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 recessed ends, or forked structures. This strand separation activity is increased on cisplatin\u2010modified DNA or with duplex molecules containing mismatches. In addition to its exonuclease activity, YB\u20101 exhibits endonucleolytic activities in vitro. Finally, YB\u20101 affinity chromatography experiments have indicated that in addition to prespliceosome factors like nucleolin and ALY, YB\u20101 binds the DNA repair proteins MSH2, DNA polymerase \u03b4, Ku80 and WRN proteins in vitro. Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies have shown that YB\u20101 re\u2010localizes from the cytoplasm to nuclear areas containing either Ku80 or MSH2 proteins in human 293 embryonic kidney cells. These results suggest that YB\u20101 is involved in base excision and mismatch repair pathways.", "authors": ["Isabelle Gaudreault", "David Guay", "Michel Lebel"], "about": ["cisplatin", "dna", "exonuclease", "binding (molecular function)", "dna repair protein", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "YB\u20101 promotes strand separation in vitro of duplex DNA containing either mispaired bases or cisplatin modifications, exhibits endonucleolytic activities and binds several DNA repair proteins\r\n "}
