This procedure is based upon our finding that double\u2010stranded DNA molecules at a site where RecA\u2010mediated triple\u2010stranded DNA structure with a complimentary deoxyoligonucleotide is located can be cleaved by a single\u2010strand specific nuclease, such as nuclease S1 or BAL31, between the first base at the 5\u2032 termini of the deoxyoligonucleotides and the nearest base proximal to the 5\u2032 termini. Accordingly, the sequence as well as the number of the cleavage sites to be cleaved can be custom designed by selecting deoxyoligonucleotides with specific base sequences for triple\u2010stranded DNA formation. The basic characteristics of the cleavage reaction and typical applications of the procedure are presented with actual results, including those which involve cleavage of complex genomic DNA at the very sites one desires.", "authors": ["Yasushi Shigemori", "Michio Oishi"], "about": ["base sequence", "dna", "genome", "cytokinesis", "nuclease", "dna structure", "dna cleavage", "molecule", "Nucleic acid modification"], "title": "Specific cleavage of DNA molecules at RecA\u2010mediated triple\u2010strand structure\r\n "}
