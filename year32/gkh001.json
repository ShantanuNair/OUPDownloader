The National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences in Tsukuba, Japan, has accumulated numerous rice biological resources and has already successfully produced a high\u2010quality genome sequence, a high\u2010density genetic map with 3000 markers, 30 000 full\u2010length cDNAs, over 700 expression profiles with a 9000 cDNA microarray and 15\u00a0000 flanking sequences with Tos17 insertions in about 3765 mutant lines from about 50 000 transposon insertion lines. These resources are available in the public domain. A new unification tool for functional genomics, called Rice PIPELINE, has also been developed for the dynamic collection and compilation of genomics data (genome sequences, full\u2010length cDNAs, gene expression profiles, mutant lines, cis elements) from various databases. The mission of Rice PIPELINE is to provide a unique scientific resource that pools publicly available rice genomic data for search by clone sequence, clone name, GenBank accession number, or keyword. The web\u2010based form of Rice PIPELINE is available at http://cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/PIPE/ .
