It contains data from humans and other organisms, including Drosophilamelanogaster , Caenorhabditiselegans , Saccharo mycescerevisiae , Methanococcus jannaschii and Escherichia coli . Users can search the database by gene name and organism. Each record includes sequences (genomic, cDNA and amino acid sequences), intron/exon structures, genomic locations and information about orthologs. In addition, users can view and compare the gene structures of the above organisms and make multiple amino acid sequence alignments. RPG also provides information on small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that are encoded in the introns of RP genes.
