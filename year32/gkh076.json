Since its first release in 2002, it has been updated several times. First, the amount of stored data has increased significantly: e.g. the number of clones that match both the RefSeq mRNA set and the genome sequence has increased from 111\u00a0382 to 190\u00a0964, now covering 11\u00a0234 genes. Second, the positions of SNPs in dbSNP were displayed on the upstream regions of contained human genes. Third, DBTSS now covers other species such as mouse and the human malaria parasite. It will become a central database containing data for many more species with oligo\u2010capping and related methods. Lastly, the database now serves for comparative promoter analyses: in the current version, comparative views of potentially orthologous promoters from human and mouse are presented with an additional function of searching potential transcription\u2010factor binding sites, which are either conserved or diverged between species.
