These proteins have been found to form two distinct complexes in vivo, Rad51B\u2013Rad51C\u2013Rad51D\u2013Xrcc2 (BCDX2) and Rad51C\u2013Xrcc3 (CX3). Based on the recent Pyrococcus furiosus Rad51 structure, we have used homology modeling to design deletion mutants of the Rad51 paralogs. The models of the human Rad51B, Rad51C, Xrcc3 and murine Rad51D (mRad51D) proteins reveal distinct N\u2010terminal and C\u2010terminal domains connected by a linker region. Using yeast two\u2010hybrid and co\u2010immunoprecipitation techniques, we have demonstrated that a fragment of Rad51B containing amino acid residues 1\u201375 interacts with the C\u2010terminus and linker of Rad51C, residues 79\u2013376, and this region of Rad51C also interacts with mRad51D and Xrcc3. We have also determined that the N\u2010terminal domain of mRad51D, residues 4\u201377, binds to Xrcc2 while the C\u2010terminal domain of mRad51D, residues 77\u2013328, binds Rad51C. By this, we have identified the binding domains of the BCDX2 and CX3 complexes to further characterize the interaction of these proteins and propose a scheme for the three\u2010dimensional architecture of the BCDX2 and CX3 paralog complexes.", "authors": ["Kristi A.
