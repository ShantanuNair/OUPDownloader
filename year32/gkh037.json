Thus far we have performed EST analysis of various organs (thymus, spleen, uterus, lung, liver, ovary and peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and assembled 68 076 high\u2010quality sequences into 5546 contigs and 28 461 singlets. PEDE provides a search interface for getting results of homology searches and enables users to obtain information on sequence data and cDNA clones of interest. Single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms detected through comparison of the EST sequences are classified by origin (western and oriental breeds) and are searchable in the database. This database system can accelerate analyses of livestock traits and yields information that can lead to new applications in pigs as model systems for medical research.
