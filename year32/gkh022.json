The database also serves as a sample\u2010tracking system to manage the process from cDNA to experimental read\u2010out and data interpretation. A web interface enables the scientific community to explore and visualize features of the annotated cDNAs and ORFs combined with experimental results, and thus helps to unravel new features of proteins with as yet unknown functions.
