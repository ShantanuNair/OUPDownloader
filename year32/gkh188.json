It was found that the population of triplex\u2010forming oligonucleotide target sequences (TTS) is much more abundant than that expected from simple random models. The population of TTS is large in all the genome, without major differences between chromosomes. A wide analysis along annotated regions of the genome allows us to demonstrate that the largest relative concentration of TTS is found in regulatory regions, especially in promoter zones, which suggests a tremendous potentiality for triplex strategy in the control of gene expression. The dependence of the stability and selectivity of the triplexes on the length of the TTS is also analysed using knowledge\u2010based rules.", "authors": ["J.
