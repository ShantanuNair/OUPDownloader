{"keywords": ["dna", "dna-directed dna polymerase"], "abstract": "The thumb subdomain, located in various family B DNA polymerases in the C\u2010terminal region, has been shown in their crystal structures to move upon binding of DNA, changing its conformation to nearly completely wrap around the DNA. It has therefore been involved in DNA binding. In agreement with this, partial proteolysis studies of \u03d529 DNA polymerase have shown that the accessibility of the cleavage sites located in their C\u2010terminal region is reduced in the presence of DNA or terminal protein (TP), indicating that a conformational change occurs in this region upon substrate binding and suggesting that this region might be involved in DNA and TP binding. Therefore, we have studied the role of the C\u2010terminus of \u03d529 DNA polymerase by deletion of the last 13 residues of this enzyme. This fragment includes a previously defined region conserved in family B DNA polymerases. The resulting DNA polymerase \u039413 was strongly affected in DNA binding, resulting in a distributive replication activity. Additionally, the capacity of the truncated polymerase to interact with TP was strongly reduced and its initiation activity was very low. On the other hand, its nucleotide binding affinity and its fidelity were not affected. We propose that the C\u2010terminal 13 amino acids of \u03d529 DNA polymerase are involved in DNA binding and in a stable interaction with the initiator protein TP, playing an important role in the intrinsic processivity of this enzyme during polymerization.", "authors": ["Ver\u00f3nica Truniger", "Jos\u00e9 M.
