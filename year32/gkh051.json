{"keywords": ["alternative splicing", "dna", "exons", "genes", "internet", "introns", "genbank"], "abstract": " Xpro is a relational database that contains all the eukaryotic protein\u2010encoding DNA sequences contained in GenBank with associated data required for the analysis of eukaryotic gene architecture. In addition to the information found in the GenBank records, which includes properties such as sequence, position, length and description about introns, exons and protein\u2010coding regions, Xpro provides annotations on the splice sites and intron phases. Furthermore, Xpro validates intron positions using alignment information between the record\u2019s sequence and EST sequences found in dbEST. In the process of validation, alternative splicing information is also obtained and can be found in the database. The intron\u2010containing genes in the Xpro are also classified as experimental or predicted based on the intron position validation and specific keywords in the GenBank records that are present in predicted genes. An Entrez\u2010like query system, which is familiar to most biologists, is provided for accessing the information present in the database system. A non\u2010redundant set of Xpro database contents is also obtained by cross\u2010referencing to the Swiss\u2010Prot/TrEMBL and Pfam databases. The database currently contains information for 493 983 genes\u2014351 918 intron\u2010 containing genes and 142 065 intron\u2010less genes. Xpro is updated for each new GenBank release and is freely available via the internet at http://origin.bic. nus.edu.sg/xpro . ", "authors": ["Vivek Gopalan", "Tin Wee Tan", "Bernett T. K.
