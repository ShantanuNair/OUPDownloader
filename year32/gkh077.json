These peptides exhibit antibiotic and membrane channel\u2010forming activities. The database includes sequence, biological source and bibliographical data for the naturally occurring peptaibols. Information is also collated for the growing number of peptaibol 3D structures determined by either crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. The database can be obtained as a whole or can be queried by name, group, sequence motif, biological origin and/or literature reference.
