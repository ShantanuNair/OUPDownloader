ASforms are defined by comparing high\u2010scoring ESTs with mRNA sequences using BLAST, taking known exon\u2013intron information (from the Ensembl database). Filtering programs compare the ends of each aligned sequence pair for deletions or insertions in the EST sequence, which indicate the existence of alternative splice forms with respect to the exon\u2013intron boundaries. Moreover, we defined the alternative splice profile of each human sequence. It indicates the number of alternatively spliced ESTs (NAE), the number of constitutively spliced ESTs (NCE) as well as the number of alternative splice sites (NSS) per mRNA. NAE and NCE correspond to the EST coverage and can be used as a quality indicator for the predicted alternative splice variants. The NSS value specifies the splice propensity of a gene. Additionally, the tissue type information of all ESTs was included. This allows (i) restriction of the search to certain tissues and (ii) calculation of the tissue\u2010NAEs, tissue\u2010NCEs and tissue\u2010NSS. These scores are suitable for the estimation of tissue specificity of certain ASforms. Furthermore, the developmental stage and disease information of the ESTs is available.
