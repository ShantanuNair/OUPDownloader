A green fluorescent protein (GFP) artificial exon carried by a transposable P \u2010element is mobilized and inserted into a host gene intron creating a GFP fusion protein. The sequence of the tagged gene is determined by sequencing inverse\u2010PCR products derived from genomic DNA. Flytrap contains two principle data types: micrographs of protein localization and a cellular component ontology, based on rules derived from the Gene Ontology consortium ( http://www.geneontology.org ), describing protein localization. Flytrap also has links to gene information contained in Flybase ( http:// flybase.bio.indiana.edu ). The system is designed to accept submissions of micrographs and descriptions from any type of tissue (e.g. wing imaginal disk, ovary) and at any stage of development. Insertion lines can be searched using a number of queries, including Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) numbers and protein localization. In addition, Flytrap provides online order forms linked to each insertion line so that users may request any line generated from this project. Flytrap may be accessed from the homepage at http://flytrap.med. yale.edu . ", "authors": ["Reed J. Kelso", "Michael Buszczak", "Ana T.
