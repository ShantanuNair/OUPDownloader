The resulting images of gene expression patterns, chiefly of E14.5 mouse embryos, are accessible to the public at http://www.genepaint.org . This relational database is searchable for gene identifiers and RNA probe sequences. Moreover, patterns and intensity of expression in \u223c100 different embryonic tissues are annotated and can be searched using a standardized catalog of anatomical structures. A virtual microscope tool, the Zoom Image Server, was implemented in GenePaint.org and permits interactive zooming and panning across \u223c15 000 high\u2010resolution images.
