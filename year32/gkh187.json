While the 9mers showed no significant antisense effect, the 11\u201315mers induced exon 4 skipping and exon 3+4 double skipping to about an equal extent upon lipofectamine mediated transfection in a sequence\u2010 and dose\u2010dependent manner, as revealed by a RT\u2013PCR assay. The antisense efficacy of the tc\u2010oligonucleotides was found to be superior to that of the LNA\u2010oligonucleotides in all cases by a factor of at least 4\u20135. A tc\u2010oligonucleotide 15mer completely abolished CyPA mRNA production at 0.2 \u00b5M concentration. The antisense effect was confirmed by western blot analysis which revealed a reduction in CyPA protein to 13% of its normal level. Fluorescence microscopic investigations with a fluorescein labeled tc\u201015mer revealed a strong propensity for homogeneous nuclear localization of this backbone type after lipofectamine mediated transfection, while the corresponding lna 15mer showed a less clear cellular distribution pattern. Transfection without lipid carrier showed no significant internalization of both tc\u2010 and LNA\u2010 oligonucleotides. The obtained results confirm the power of tc\u2010DNA for nuclear antisense applications. Moreover, CyPA may become an interesting therapeutic target due to its important role in the early steps of the viral replication of HIV\u20101.", "authors": ["Damian Ittig", "Songkai Liu", "Dorte Renneberg", "Daniel Sch\u00fcmperli", "Christian J.
