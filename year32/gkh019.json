{"keywords": ["amino acid sequence", "catalysis", "catalytic domain", "genes", "genome", "phosphotransferases", "protein kinase", "threonine"], "abstract": " The KinG database is a comprehensive collection of serine/threonine/tyrosine\u2010specific kinases and their homologues identified in various completed genomes using sequence and profile search methods. The database hosted at http://hodgkin. mbu.iisc.ernet.in/\u223cking provides the amino acid sequences, functional domain assignments and classification of gene products containing protein kinase domains. A search tool enabling the retrieval of protein kinases with specified subfamily and domain combinations is one of the key features of the resource. Identification of a kinase catalytic domain in the user\u2019s query sequence is possible using another search tool. The occurrence and location of critical catalytic residues if the query has a catalytic kinase domain, recognition of non\u2010kinase domains in the sequence and subfamily classification of the kinase in the query will help in deciphering the biological role of the kinase. This online compilation can also be used to compare the protein kinases of a given subfamily and domain combinations across various genomes. Another exclusive feature of the database is the collection of the Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases and similar sequences encoded in the genomes of archaea and bacteria. ", "authors": ["A. Krupa", "K. R.
