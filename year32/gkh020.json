{"keywords": ["amino acid sequence", "polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis", "proteome", "rice", "maps"], "abstract": " The Rice Proteome Database is the first detailed database to describe the proteome of rice. The current release contains 21 reference maps based on two\u2010dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D\u2010PAGE) of proteins from rice tissues and subcellular compartments. These reference maps comprise 11 941 identified proteins showing tissue and subcellular localization, corresponding to 4180 separate protein entries in the database. The Rice Proteome Database contains the calculated properties of each protein such as molecular weight, isoelectric point and expression; experimentally determined properties such as amino acid sequences obtained using protein sequencers and mass spectrometry; and the results of database searches such as sequence homologies. The database is searchable by keyword, accession number, protein name, isoelectric point, molecular weight and amino acid sequence, or by selection of a spot on one of the 2D\u2010PAGE reference maps. Cross\u2010references are provided to tools for proteomics and to other 2D\u2010PAGE databases, which in turn provide many links to other molecular databases. The information in the Rice Proteome Database is updated weekly, and is available on the World Wide Web at http://gene64.dna.affrc.go.jp/RPD/ .
