Computer analysis shows that the non\u2010polyadenylated extreme 3\u2032\u2010untranslated regions (UTRs) of the coding strand of both genomic segments are able to fold into a single stem\u2013loop structure. To assess the determinants for a functional 3\u2032\u2010UTR, we mutagenized the 3\u2032\u2010UTR stem\u2013loop structure of the B\u2010segment. Rescue of infectious virus from mutagenized cDNA plasmids was impaired in all cases. However, after one passage, the replication kinetics of these viruses were restored. Sequence analysis revealed that additional mutations had been acquired in most of the stem\u2013loop structures, which compensated the introduced ones. A rescued virus with a modified stem\u2013loop structure containing four nucleotide substitutions, but preserving its overall secondary structure, was phenotypically indistinguishable from wild\u2010type virus, both in vitro (cell culture) and in vivo (chickens, natural host). Sequence analysis showed that the modified stem\u2013loop structure of this virus was fully preserved after four serial passages. Apparently, it is the stem\u2013loop structure and not the primary sequence that is the functional determinant in the 3\u2032\u2010UTRs of IBDV.", "authors": ["Hein J. Boot", "Sylvia B. E.
