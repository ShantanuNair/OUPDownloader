They are part of IMGT, the international ImMunoGenetics information system\u00ae, a high\u2010quality integrated knowledge resource specializing in immunoglobulins (IG), T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of human and other vertebrate species, which consists of databases, Web resources and interactive on\u2010line tools. IMGT/3Dstructure\u2010DB data are described according to the IMGT Scientific chart rules based on the IMGT\u2010ONTOLOGY concepts. IMGT/3Dstructure\u2010DB provides IMGT gene and allele identification of IG, TR and MHC proteins with known 3D structures, domain delimitations, amino acid positions according to the IMGT unique numbering and renumbered coordinate flat files. Moreover IMGT/3Dstructure\u2010DB provides 2D graphical representations (or Collier de Perles) and results of contact analysis. The IMGT/StructuralQuery tool allows search of this database based on specific structural characteristics. IMGT/3Dstructure\u2010DB and IMGT/StructuralQuery are freely available at http://imgt. cines.fr .
