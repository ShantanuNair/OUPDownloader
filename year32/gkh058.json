The database contains mouse SAGE libraries organized in a uniform way and provides web\u2010based tools for browsing, comparing and searching SAGE data with reliable tag\u2010to\u2010gene identification. A modified approach based on the SAGEmap database is used for reliable tag identification. The Mouse SAGE Site is maintained on an ongoing basis at the Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and is accessible at the internet address http://mouse.biomed.cas.cz/sage/ .
