The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) is crucial for the maintenance of the DNA damage checkpoint function because it elicits cell cycle arrest in response to a variety of genotoxic stresses. Although sporadic loss of RB is characteristic of most cancers and results in the bypass of the DNA damage checkpoint, the consequence of RB loss upon chemotherapeutic responsiveness has been largely uninvestigated. Here, we employed a conditional knockout approach to ablate RB in adult fibroblasts. This system enabled us to examine the DNA damage response of adult cells following acute RB deletion. Using this system, we demonstrated that loss of RB disrupted the DNA damage checkpoint elicited by either cisplatin or camptothecin exposure. Strikingly, this bypass was not associated with enhanced repair, but rather the accumulation of phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) foci, which indicate DNA double\u2010strand breaks. The formation of \u03b3H2AX foci was due to ongoing replication following chemotherapeutic treatment in the RB\u2010deficient cells. Additionally, peak \u03b3H2AX accumulation occurred in S\u2010phase cells undergoing DNA replication in the presence of damage, and these \u03b3H2AX foci co\u2010localized with replication foci. These results demonstrate that acute RB loss abrogates DNA damage\u2010induced cell cycle arrest to induce \u03b3H2AX foci formation. Thus, secondary genetic lesions induced by RB loss have implications for the chemotherapeutic response and the development of genetic instability.", "authors": ["Emily E. Bosco", "Christopher N.
