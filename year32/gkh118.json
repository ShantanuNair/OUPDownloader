The ORFDB serves as a central data warehouse enabling researchers to search the ORF collection through its web portal ORFBrowser, allowing researchers to find the Ultimate\u2122 ORF clones by blast, keyword, GenBank accession, gene symbol, clone ID, Unigene ID, LocusLink ID or through functional relationships by browsing the collection via the Gene Ontology (GO) Browser. As of October 2003, the ORFDB contains 6200 human and 2870 mouse Ultimate\u2122 ORF clones. All Ultimate\u2122 ORF clones have been fully sequenced with high quality, and are matched to public reference protein sequences. In addition, the cloned ORFs have been extensively annotated across six categories: Gene, ORF, Clone Format, Protein, SNP and Genomic links, with the information assembled in a format termed the ORFCard. The ORFCard represents an information repository that documents the sequence quality, alignment with respect to public protein sequences, and the latest publicly available information associated with each human and mouse gene represented in the collection.
