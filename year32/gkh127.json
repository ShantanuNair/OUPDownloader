{"keywords": ["gene expression", "dna", "genome", "internet", "rice"], "abstract": " In the past year we at DDBJ ( http://www.ddbj.nig. ac.jp ) have made a steady increase in the number of data submissions with a 50.6% increment in the number of bases or 46.5% increment in the number of entries. Among them the genome data of man, ascidian and rice hold the top three. Our activity has extended to providing a tool that enables sequence retrieval using regular expressions, and to launching our SOAP server and web services to facilitate the acquisition of proper data and tools from a huge number of biological data resources on websites worldwide. We have also opened our public gene expression database, CIBEX. ", "authors": ["S. Miyazaki", "H. Sugawara", "K. Ikeo", "T. Gojobori", "Y.
