Transfer between RNA strands during DNA synthesis is governed by both sequence similarity between templates and structural features of the dimeric RNA. A kissing hairpin, believed to facilitate intermolecular recognition and dimer formation, was previously found to be a preferred site for recombination. To investigate if hairpin loop\u2013loop\u2010complementarity is the primary determinant for this recombination preference, we have devised a novel 5\u2032 leader recombination assay based upon co\u2010packaging of two wild\u2010type or loop\u2010modified murine leukemia virus vector RNAs. We found that insertion of an alternative palindromic loop in one of the two vectors disrupted site\u2010directed template switching, whereas site\u2010specificity was restored between vectors with complementary non\u2010wild\u2010type palindromes. By pairing vector RNAs that contained identical non\u2010palindromic loop motifs and that were unlikely to interact by loop\u2013loop kissing, we found no preference for recombination at the kissing hairpin site. Of vector pairs designed to interact through base pairing of non\u2010palindromic loop motifs, we could in one case restore hairpin\u2010directed template switching, in spite of the reduced sequence identity, whereas another pair failed to support hairpin\u2010 directed recombination. However, analyses of in vitro RNA dimerization of all studied vector combinations showed a good correlation between efficient dimer formation between loop\u2010modified viral RNAs and in vivo cDNA transfer at the kissing hairpin. Our findings demonstrate that complementarity between wild\u2010type or non\u2010wild\u2010type hairpin kissing loops is essential but not sufficient for site\u2010specific 5\u2032 leader recombination and lend further support to the hypothesis that a specific \u2018kissing\u2019 loop\u2013loop interaction is guided by complementary sequences and maintained within the mature dimeric RNA of retroviruses.", "authors": ["Jacob Giehm Mikkelsen", "S\u00f8ren Vestergaard Rasmussen", "Finn Skou Pedersen"], "about": ["base pairing", "dimerization", "recombination, genetic", "retroviridae", "rna", "transfer technique", "dimers", "kissing", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Complementarity\u2010directed RNA dimer\u2010linkage promotes retroviral recombination in vivo\n "}
