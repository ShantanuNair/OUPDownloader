A comprehensive and searchable database of published miRNA sequences is accessible via a web interface ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/ ), and all sequence and annotation data are freely available for download. Release 2.0 of the database contains 506 miRNA entries from six organisms.
