The database currently incorporates all available sequence data (Genomic, BAC, EST) in a single user\u2010friendly location. The database contains a variety of tools specifically designed for searching unannotated draft sequence via BLAST, keyword searches of pre\u2010computed BLAST results, and protein motif searches. Release 1.0 of the database contains nearly 730 million bp of genome sequence from 1.1 million sequence reads generated by the TIGR\u2013Karolinska\u2013SBRI Trypanosoma cruzi Genome Consortium and 15 million bp of clustered EST and genomic sequence obtained from other sources. As annotation, microarray and proteomic data become available, the database will incorporate and integrate these data using the GUS ( http://www.gusdb. org ) relational framework.
