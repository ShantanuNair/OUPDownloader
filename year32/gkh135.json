One of the major new features we present here is a set of tools that allows for inter\u2010organism comparisons. This should enable the fission yeast community to take advantage of the large amount of available information on budding yeast transcriptome. New tools and ongoing developments are also presented here. ", "authors": ["Ga\u00eblle Lelandais", "St\u00e9phane Le Crom", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Devaux", "St\u00e9phane Vialette", "George M.
