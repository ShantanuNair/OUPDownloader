AppaDB, a P.pacificus database, was created ( http://appadb.eb.tuebingen. mpg.de ) to integrate the genomic data of P.pacificus , comprising the physical map, genetic linkage map, EST and BAC end sequence and hybridization data. This developing database serves as a repository to search and find any information regarding physical contigs or genetic markers required for mapping of mutants. Additionally, it provides a platform for the Caenorhabditis elegans community to compare nematode genetic data in an evolutionary perspective. ", "authors": ["Jagan Srinivasan", "Georg W.
