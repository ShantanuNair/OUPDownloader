The most common data stored in TropGENE\u2010DB are information on genetic resources (agro\u2010morphological data, parentages, allelic diversity), molecular markers, genetic maps, results of quantitative trait loci analyses, data from physical mapping, sequences, genes, as well as the corresponding references. TropGENE\u2010DB is organized on a crop basis with currently three running modules (sugarcane, cocoa and banana), with plans to create additional modules for rice, cotton, oil palm, coconut, rubber tree, pineapple, taro, yam and sorghum. The TropGENE\u2010DB information system is accessible for consultation via the internet at http://tropgenedb.cirad.fr . Specific web consultation interfaces have been designed to allow quick consultations as well as complex queries.
