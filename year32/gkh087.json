{"keywords": ["genes", "escherichia coli", "accents"], "abstract": " Using more than one approach to characterizing functions of unknown proteins, we now present in GenProtEC ( http://genprotec.mbl.edu/ ) some level of function information for 87% of Escherichia coli K\u201012 proteins. A new approach that has yielded new information entails assigning content of structural domains and their functions to E.coli proteins. In addition, some earlier methods have been further refined to provide more meaningful data. The process of identifying and separating multimodular or fused proteins into component modules has been improved. As a result, groups of sequence\u2010similar (paralogous) proteins have been refined. Experimental information from recent literature on previously unknown genes has been incorporated. We now use a rich system of characterizing cell roles which accents the fact that many proteins play more than one cellular role and therefore carry more than one designation from our detailed catalog of roles, MultiFun.
