Recent evidence suggested that adipocytes and osteoblasts share a common mesenchymal precursor cell phenotype. Yet, the molecular details underlying the decision of adipocyte versus osteoblast differentiation as well as the involvement of C/EBPs and BMPs remains elusive. We have engineered C2C12 cells for dual\u2010regulated expression of human C/EBP\u2010\u03b1 and BMP\u20102 to enable independent transcription control of both differentiation factors using clinically licensed antibiotics of the streptogramin (pristinamycin) and tetracycline (tetracycline) classes. Differential as well as coordinated expression of C/EBP\u2010\u03b1 and BMP\u20102 revealed that (i) C/EBP\u2010\u03b1 may differentiate C2C12 myoblasts into adipocytes as well as osteoblasts, (ii) BMP\u20102 prevents myotube differentiation, (iii) is incompetent in differentiating C2C12 into osteoblasts and (iv) even decreases C/EBP\u2010\u03b1\u2019s osteoblast\u2010specific differentiation potential but (v) cooperates with C/EBP\u2010\u03b1 on adipocyte differentiation, (vi) osteoblast formation occurs at low C/EBP\u2010\u03b1 levels while adipocyte\u2010specific differentiation requires maximum C/EBP\u2010\u03b1 expression and that (vii) BMP\u20102 may bias the C/EBP\u2010\u03b1\u2010mediated adipocyte versus osteoblast differentiation switch towards fat cell formation. Dual\u2010regulated expression technology enabled precise insight into combinatorial effects of two key differentiation factors involved in adipocyte/osteoblast lineage control which could be implemented in rational reprogramming of multipotent cells into desired cell phenotypes tailored for gene therapy and tissue engineering.", "authors": ["Cornelia Fux", "Barbara Mitta", "Beat P.
