Here, we report for the first time the effect of site\u2010specific N2\u2010deoxyguanosine (dG) and N6\u2010deoxyadenosine (dA) adducts derived from BaP 7,8\u2010diol 9,10\u2010epoxide (BaP DE) and dA adducts from benzo[c]phenanthrene 3,4\u2010diol 1,2\u2010epoxide (BcPh DE) on DNA replication by exonuclease\u2010deficient human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol \u03b3) with and without the p55 processivity subunit. The catalytic subunit alone primarily misincorporated dAMP and dGMP opposite the BaP DE\u2013dG adducts, and incorporated the correct dTMP as well as the incorrect dAMP opposite the DE\u2013dA adducts derived from both BaP and BcPh. In the presence of p55 the polymerase incorporated all four nucleotides and catalyzed limited translesion synthesis past BaP DE\u2013dG adducts but not past BaP or BcPh DE\u2013dA adducts. Thus, all these adducts cause erroneous purine incorporation and significant blockage of further primer elongation. Purine misincorporation by pol \u03b3 opposite the BaP DE\u2013dG adducts resembles that observed with the Y family pol \u03b7. Blockage of translesion synthesis by these DE adducts is consistent with known BaP inhibition of mitochondrial (mt)DNA synthesis and suggests that continued exposure to BaP reduces mtDNA copy number, increasing the opportunity for repopulation with pre\u2010existing mutant mtDNA and a resultant risk of mitochondrial genetic diseases.", "authors": ["Maria A.
