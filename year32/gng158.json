A new strategy using bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase and partially degenerate adapters is proposed for grafting a sequence tag to the end of polyribonucleotides. Based on this RNA tagging system and previously described protocols, a new method for full\u2010length cDNA production has been implemented. Validation of the method is shown in Arabidopsis thaliana by the construction of a full\u2010length cDNA library and the analysis of 154 clones and by 5\u2032\u2010RACE\u2013PCR run on a documented experimental system.", "authors": ["Christian Clepet", "Isabelle Le Clainche", "Michel Caboche"], "about": ["polymerase chain reaction", "clone cells", "dna ligases", "dna, complementary", "libraries", "rna", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning"], "title": "Improved full\u2010length cDNA production based on RNA tagging by T4 DNA ligase\r\n "}
