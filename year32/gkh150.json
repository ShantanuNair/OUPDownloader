Recent studies have shown that the repair of lesions within clusters may be compromised, but little is understood about the mutagenic consequences of such damage sites. Using a plasmid\u2010based method, damaged DNA containing uracil positioned at 1\u20135 bp separations from 8\u2010oxo\u20107,8\u2010dihydroguanine on the complementary strand was transfected into wild\u2010type Escherichia coli or into strains lacking the DNA glycosylases Fpg and MutY. Mutation frequencies were found to be significantly higher for clustered damage sites than for single lesions. The loss of MutY gave a large relative increase in mutation frequency and a strain lacking both Fpg and MutY showed even higher mutation frequencies, up to nearly 40% of rescued plasmid. In these strains, the mutation frequency decreases with increasing spacing of the uracil from the 8\u2010oxo\u20107,8\u2010dihydroguanine site. Sequencing of plasmid DNA carrying clustered damage, following rescue from bacteria, showed that almost all of the mutations are GC\u2192TA transversions. The data suggest that at clustered damage sites, depending on lesion spacing, the action of Fpg is compromised and post\u2010replication processing of lesions by MutY is the most important mechanism for protection against mutagenesis.", "authors": ["Colin G.
