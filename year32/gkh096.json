The PDB\u2019s mandate is to disseminate this information in the most usable form and as widely as possible. The current query and distribution system is described and an alpha version of the future re\u2010engineered system introduced. ", "authors": ["Philip E. Bourne", "Kenneth J. Addess", "Wolfgang F.
