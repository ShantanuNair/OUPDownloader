The preferred models for representation of transcription factor binding specificity have been termed position\u2010specific scoring matrices. JASPAR is an open\u2010access database of annotated, high\u2010quality, matrix\u2010based transcription factor binding site profiles for multicellular eukaryotes. The profiles were derived exclusively from sets of nucleotide sequences experimentally demonstrated to bind transcription factors. The database is complemented by a web interface for browsing, searching and subset selection, an online sequence analysis utility and a suite of programming tools for genome\u2010wide and comparative genomic analysis of regulatory regions. JASPAR is available at http://jaspar. cgb.ki.se . ", "authors": ["Albin Sandelin", "Wynand Alkema", "P\u00e4r Engstr\u00f6m", "Wyeth W.
