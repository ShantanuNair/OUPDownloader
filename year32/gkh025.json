{"keywords": ["antifungal agents", "antiviral agents", "hydrophobicity", "peptides", "antimicrobials", "anti-bacterial agents"], "abstract": " An antimicrobial peptide database (APD) has been established based on an extensive literature search. It contains detailed information for 525 peptides (498 antibacterial, 155 antifungal, 28 antiviral and 18 antitumor). APD provides interactive interfaces for peptide query, prediction and design. It also provides statistical data for a select group of or all the peptides in the database. Peptide information can be searched using keywords such as peptide name, ID, length, net charge, hydrophobic percentage, key residue, unique sequence motif, structure and activity. APD is a useful tool for studying the structure\u2013function relationship of antimicrobial peptides. The database can be accessed via a web\u2010based browser at the URL: http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/main.html .
