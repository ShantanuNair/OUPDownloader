(i) We added 8934 sequences generated from the addition of new libraries, so that our collection of 11 424 full\u2010length cDNAs covers 1375 (25%) of the estimated number of the entire 5409 parasite genes. (ii) All of our full\u2010length cDNAs and GenBank EST sequences were mapped to genomic sequences together with publicly available annotated genes and other predictions. This precisely determined the gene structures and positions of the transcriptional start sites, which are indispensable for the identification of the promoter regions. (iii) A total of 4257 cDNA sequences were newly generated from murine malaria parasites, Plasmodium yoelii yoelii . The genome/cDNA sequences were compared at both nucleotide and amino acid levels, with those of P.falciparum , and the sequence alignment for each gene is presented graphically. This part of the database serves as a versatile platform to elucidate the function(s) of malaria genes by a comparative genomic approach. It should also be noted that all of the cDNAs represented in this database are supported by physical cDNA clones, which are publicly and freely available, and should serve as indispensable resources to explore functional analyses of malaria genomes.
