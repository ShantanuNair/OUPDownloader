The Human Protein Reference Database ( http://www.hprd.org ) is a web\u2010based resource based on open source technologies for protein information about several aspects of human proteins including protein\u2013protein interactions, post\u2010translational modifications, enzyme\u2013substrate relationships and disease associations. This information was derived manually by a critical reading of the published literature by expert biologists and through bioinformatics analyses of the protein sequence. This database will assist in biomedical discoveries by serving as a resource of genomic and proteomic information and providing an integrated view of sequence, structure, function and protein networks in health and disease.
