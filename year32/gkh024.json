{"keywords": ["genes", "genes, essential", "anti-bacterial agents", "basic local alignment search tool"], "abstract": " Essential genes are genes that are indispensable to support cellular life. These genes constitute a minimal gene set required for a living cell. We have constructed a Database of Essential Genes (DEG), which contains all the essential genes that are currently available. The functions encoded by essential genes are considered a foundation of life and therefore are likely to be common to all cells. Users can BLAST the query sequences against DEG. If homologous genes are found, it is possible that the queried genes are also essential. Users can search for essential genes by their function or name. Users can also browse and extract all the records in DEG. Essential gene products comprise excellent targets for antibacterial drugs. Analysis of essential genes could help to answer the question of what are the basic functions necessary to support cellular life. DEG is freely accessible from the website http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg/ .
