The CIRCE element was identified as the target for the HrcA protein, which represses transcription of heat shock genes under normal growth temperature. Our data reveal that the CIRCE element is not involved in the temperature\u2010dependent transcription of the groESL genes in Rhodobacter capsulatus. Apparently, R.capsulatus does not harbour an HrcA protein. The mechanisms of heat shock regulation of the groESL genes in R.capsulatus therefore diverge significantly from the regulatory pathway identified in other organisms. A structural analysis of the CIRCE RNA element revealed a stem of 11 nt pairs and a loop of only 5 nt. This folding differs from a structure with a 9 nt loop suggested previously on the basis of computer analysis. The RNA structure leads to a slight stabilization of the groESL mRNA that is more pronounced at normal growth temperature than under heat shock conditions.", "authors": ["Stephanie J\u00e4ger", "Andreas J\u00e4ger", "Gabriele Klug"], "about": ["dna", "genes", "heat-shock response", "rhodobacter capsulatus", "rna, messenger", "temperature", "rna", "stabilization", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "CIRCE is not involved in heat\u2010dependent transcription of groESL but in stabilization of the mRNA 5\u2032\u2010end in Rhodobacter capsulatus\n "}
