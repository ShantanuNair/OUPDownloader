These riboswitches selectively bind metabolites and modulate gene expression in response to changing ligand concentrations. Previously, we provided evidence that the btuB mRNAs of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium each carry a coenzyme B12\u2010dependent riboswitch that causes repressed translation of the encoded cobalamin\u2010transport protein at elevated coenzyme concentrations. Herein, we use a phylogenetic analysis to define a consensus sequence and secondary structure model for the ligand\u2010 binding domain of this riboswitch class. RNA structures that conform to this model are widespread in both Gram\u2010positive and Gram\u2010negative organisms. In addition, we find that the 5\u2032\u2010untranslated region (5\u2032\u2010UTR) of the cobalamin biosynthesis (cob) operon of S.typhimurium carries an RNA motif that matches this consensus sequence. Biochemical and genetic characterization of this motif confirms that the RNA directly binds coenzyme B12, and that it likely serves as a genetic control element for regulating expression of the 25\u2010gene operon for cobalamin production in this pathogen.", "authors": ["Ali Nahvi", "Jeffrey E.
