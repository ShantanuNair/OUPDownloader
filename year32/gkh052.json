{"keywords": ["software", "vocabulary, controlled", "xml", "binding (molecular function)"], "abstract": " IntAct provides an open source database and toolkit for the storage, presentation and analysis of protein interactions. The web interface provides both textual and graphical representations of protein interactions, and allows exploring interaction networks in the context of the GO annotations of the interacting proteins. A web service allows direct computational access to retrieve interaction networks in XML format. IntAct currently contains \u223c2200 binary and complex interactions imported from the literature and curated in collaboration with the Swiss\u2010Prot team, making intensive use of controlled vocabularies to ensure data consistency. All IntAct software, data and controlled vocabularies are available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact .
