We compared the hydration of self\u2010complementary DNA, RNA and 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl (2\u2032\u2010OMe) oligonucleotides GCGAAUUCGC, (UA)6 and (CG)3 using the osmotic stressing method. The number of water molecules released upon melting of oligonucleotide duplexes, \u0394nW, was calculated from the dependence of melting temperature on water activity and the enthalpy, both measured with UV thermal melting experiments. The water activity was changed by addition of ethylene glycol, glycerol and acetamide as small organic co\u2010solutes. The \u0394nW was 3\u20134 for RNA duplexes and 2\u20133 for DNA and 2\u2032\u2010OMe duplexes. Thus, the RNA duplexes were hydrated more than the DNA and the 2\u2032\u2010OMe oligonucleotide duplexes by approximately one to two water molecules depending on the sequence. Consistent with previous studies, GC base pairs were hydrated more than AU pairs in RNA, whereas in DNA and 2\u2032\u2010OMe oligonucleotides the difference in hydration between these two base pairs was relatively small. Our data suggest that the better hydration of RNA contributes to the increased enthalpic stability of RNA duplexes compared with DNA duplexes.", "authors": ["Eriks Rozners", "Janelle Moulder"], "about": ["acetamides", "base pairing", "dna", "glycerol", "nucleic acids", "oligonucleotides", "osmosis", "ethylene glycol", "temperature", "rna", "molecule", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Hydration of short DNA, RNA and 2\u2032\u2010OMe oligonucleotides determined by osmotic stressing\r\n "}
