Any methylation detection assay that would be applied to these samples must be capable of detecting small amounts of tumor DNA in the presence of background normal DNA. We have developed a real\u2010time PCR assay, called HeavyMethyl, that is well suited for this application. HeavyMethyl uses methylation\u2010specific oligonucleotide blockers and a methylation\u2010specific probe to achieve methylation\u2010specific amplification and detection. We tested the assays on unmethylated and artificially methylated DNA in order to determine the limit of detection. After careful optimization, our glutathione\u2010S\u2010transferase pi1 and Calcitonin assays can amplify as little as 30 and 60 pg of methylated DNA, respectively, and neither assay amplifies unmethylated DNA. The Calcitonin assay showed a highly significant methylation difference between normal colon and colon adenocarcinomas, and methylation was also detected in serum DNA from colon cancer patients. These assays show that HeavyMethyl technology can be successfully employed for the analysis of very low concentrations of methylated DNA, e.g. in serum of patients with tumors.", "authors": ["Susan E.
