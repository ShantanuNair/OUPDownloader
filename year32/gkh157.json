Polyamine\u2010imidazole conjugates for site\u2010selective RNA scission, without free imidazole, were synthesized and tested on yeast phenylalanine transfer RNA. These molecules catalyze RNA hydrolysis non\u2010randomly. Within the polyamine chain, the location of the imidazole residue, the numbers of nitrogen atoms and their relative distances have notable influence on cleavage selectivity. A norspermine derivative reduces the cleavage sites to a unique location, in the anticodon loop of the tRNA, in the absence of complementary sequence. Experimental results are consistent with a cooperative participation of an ammonium group of the polyamine moiety, in addition to it\u2019s binding to the negatively charged ribose\u2010phosphate backbone, as proton source, and the imidazole moiety as a base. There is correlation between the location of the magnesium binding sites and the RNA cleavage sites, suggesting that the protonated nitrogens of the polycationic chain compete with some of the magnesium ions for RNA binding. Therefore, the cleavage pattern is specific of the RNA structure. These compounds cleave at physiological pH, representing novel reactive groups for antisense oligonucleotide derivatives or to enhance ribozyme activity.", "authors": ["Sandra Fouace", "Cyril Gaudin", "Sylvie Picard", "Sophie Corvaisier", "Jacques Renault", "Bertrand Carboni", "Brice Felden"], "about": ["magnesium", "gene expression", "antisense oligonucleotides", "anticodon", "binding sites", "hydrolysis", "imidazoles", "nitrogen", "phenylalanine", "polyamines", "protons", "catalytic rna", "transfer rna", "yeasts", "genetics", "viruses", "rna", "cytokinesis", "magnesium ions", "molecule", "atom", "Synthetic Biology and Assembly Cloning", "Mutagenesis", "New Restriction Enzymes", "Nucleic acid amplification", "Nucleic acid modification", "Nucleic acid structure", "Polymorphism/mutation detection", "Protein-nucleic acid interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "Recombinant DNA expression", "Recombination", "Cell biology", "Repair", "Replication", "RNA characterisation and manipulation", "Computational Methods", "Microarray Technology", "Targeted inhibition of gene function", "Ribosomes and Protein Translation", "Massively Parallel (Deep) Sequencing", "Targeted gene modification", "Chromatin and Epigenetics", "Physical and Biochemical Characterisation of DNA", "DNA-Mediated Cell Transformation and Nucleic Acids Transfer", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology", "Genomics", "Miscellaneous/other", "Transcriptome Mapping - Monitoring Gene Expression"], "title": "Polyamine derivatives as selective RNaseA mimics\r\n "}
