We describe here how T4 DNA ligase can be used for efficient construction of DNA molecules having one 5\u2032 end but two distinct 3\u2032 ends that extend from the 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 carbons, respectively, of an internal nucleotide. The nature of the reaction products is investigated, and optimal reaction conditions are reported for the construction of branched oligonucleotides. We discuss the utility of these branched DNA nanostructures for gene detection.", "authors": ["Maritha Mendel\u2010Hartvig", "Anil Kumar", "Ulf Landegren"], "about": ["dna", "dna ligases", "genes", "ligation", "nucleic acids", "nucleotides", "oligonucleotides", "molecule", "Nucleic Acid Enzymology"], "title": "Ligase\u2010mediated construction of branched DNA strands: a novel DNA joining activity catalyzed by T4 DNA ligase\r\n "}
