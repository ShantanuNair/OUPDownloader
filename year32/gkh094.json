{"keywords": ["databases", "catalytic rna", "diagnosis", "rna", "genbank"], "abstract": " The aptamer database is designed to contain comprehensive sequence information on aptamers and unnatural ribozymes that have been generated by in vitro selection methods. Such data are not normally collected in \u2018natural\u2019 sequence databases, such as GenBank. Besides serving as a storehouse of sequences that may have diagnostic or therapeutic utility, the database serves as a valuable resource for theoretical biologists who describe and explore fitness landscapes. The database is updated monthly and is publicly available at http://aptamer. icmb.utexas.edu/ . ", "authors": ["Jennifer F. Lee", "Jay R. Hesselberth", "Lauren Ancel Meyers", "Andrew D.
