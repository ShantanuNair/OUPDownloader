The CCDB brings together both observed and derived quantitative data from numerous independent sources covering many aspects of the genomic, proteomic and metabolomic character of E.coli (strain K12). The database is self\u2010updating but also supports \u2018community\u2019 annotation, and provides an extensive array of viewing, querying and search options including a powerful, easy\u2010to\u2010use relational data extraction system.
