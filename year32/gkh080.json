{"keywords": ["base sequence", "parent", "rna", "graphical displays", "xml", "search engine"], "abstract": " SCOR, the Structural Classification of RNA ( http://scor.lbl.gov ), is a database designed to provide a comprehensive perspective and understanding of RNA motif three\u2010dimensional structure, function, tertiary interactions and their relationships. SCOR 2.0 represents a major expansion and introduces a new classification organization. The new version represents the classification as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which allows a classification node to have multiple parents, in contrast to the strictly hierarchical classification used in SCOR 1.2. SCOR 2.0 supports three types of query terms in the updated search engine: PDB or NDB identifier, nucleotide sequence and keyword. We also provide parseable XML files for all information. This new release contains 511 RNA entries from the PDB as of 15 May 2003. A total of 5880 secondary structural elements are classified: 2104 hairpin loops and 3776 internal loops. RNA motifs reported in the literature, such as \u2018Kink turn\u2019 and \u2018GNRA loops\u2019, are now incorporated into the structural classification along with definitions and descriptions.
