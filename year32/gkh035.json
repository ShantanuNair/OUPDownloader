At present, HUGE contains 2031 cDNA entries (KIAA cDNAs), for each of which a gene/protein characteristic table has been prepared. Since we have been shifting our research attention from the identification and cloning of novel cDNAs to the functional analysis of the proteins encoded by these cDNAs (KIAA proteins), we have not substantially increased the number of cDNA entries in HUGE for some time. Instead, we have manually curated 451 KIAA cDNAs in order to prepare a set of genetic resources to facilitate the functional analysis of KIAA proteins. In addition, we have updated the contents of the corresponding gene/protein characteristic tables in HUGE and have constructed two subsidiary databases, HUGEppi ( http://www. kazusa.or.jp/huge/ppi ) and ROUGE ( http://www. kazusa.or.jp/rouge ), to make available the results from our study of KIAA protein function. HUGEppi shows detailed information on protein\u2013protein interactions detected between 84 pairs of KIAA proteins by yeast two\u2010hybrid screening. ROUGE summarizes the results of computer\u2010assisted analyses of \u223c1000 mouse homologues of human large cDNAs that we identified.
